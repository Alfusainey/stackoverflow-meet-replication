The authors of the DICOS study published the source code for their paper on [GitHub](https://github.com/hyunji-Hong/Dicos-public). 
We used their source code and ran it on both the SOTorrent dataset version used by the authors (i.e., December 2020) and the newer dataset version (i.e., June 2022) we used to replicate their study.
The results are stored in `DicosResults` DB table.
