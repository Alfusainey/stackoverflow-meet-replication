abstract = {Knowledge management (KM) plays the most important role in knowledge-intensive corporation. Knowledge sharing is a critical step for successful KM. It is a difficult problem for corporation to urge staff sharing knowledge which can increase the payoff in firm. In this paper, we establish incentive model in order to promote sharing knowledge. Through analyzing the model, many valuable conclusions are drawn for manager. This article points it is not need for the organization to inspirit staff sharing knowledge if one’s knowledge is little contribute and great conceal. It is better for the organization to adopt group-based reward than to adopt individual-based reward if staff’s knowledge is low conceal. It is suitable for the organization to adopt individual-based reward if staff’s knowledge is great contribute and conceal.},

As the need to create and manage knowledge becomes increasingly more important to organizations, understanding the factors of knowledge sharing behaviors is paramount to success. Prior studies indicate that knowledge sharing takes place at the organizational and the individual level and that the factors that influence knowledge sharing are derived from the theories of social capital and social exchange. Subsequently, this study includes an overview of four theoretical frameworks derived from the theories of social capital and social exchange with the aim of developing an integrative conceptual framework for knowledge sharing.},

abstract = {Information security risk management (ISRM) is a major concern of organizations worldwide. Although the number of existing ISRM methodologies is enormous, in practice a lot of resources are invested by organizations in creating new ISRM methodologies in order to capture more accurately the risks of their complex information systems. This is a crucial knowledge-intensive process for organizations, but in most cases it is addressed in an ad hoc manner. The existence of a systematic approach for the development of new or improved ISRM methodologies would enhance the effectiveness of the process. In this paper we propose a systematic meta-process for developing new, or improved ISRM methods. We also present the specifications for a collaboration and knowledge-sharing platform supporting a virtual intra-organizational cross-disciplinary team, which aims at improving its ISRM methodologies by adopting the proposed meta-process.},

Observations of 5th grade classes playing with Lego Robolab, is used to illustrate that different ways of learning becomes visible when digital technology is employed. It is implied that one of the reasons for this is that pupils heavily draw upon their of-school digital experiences, and is here by inviting other desirable practices for exploring and sharing knowledge into the classroom. However the presence of ICT challenges the ordinary school practice and more research needs to be done before the cocktail; digital technology, play and schooling, can be shaken more widely.},

abstract = {Routing newly posted questions (a.k.a cold questions) to potential answerers with the suitable expertise in Community Question Answering sites (CQAs) is an important and challenging task. The existing methods either focus only on embedding the graph structural information and are less effective for newly posted questions, or adopt manually engineered feature vectors that are not as representative as the graph embedding methods. Therefore, we propose to address the challenge of leveraging heterogeneous graph and textual information for cold question routing by designing an end-to-end framework that jointly learns CQA node embeddings and finds best answerers for cold questions. We conducted extensive experiments to confirm the usefulness of incorporating the textual information from question tags and demonstrate that an end-to-end framework can achieve promising performances on routing newly posted questions asked by both existing users and newly registered users.},

The analysis results of benefits matrix show that, only when benefits of unlimited knowledge-sharing gaming are superior to that of limited knowledge-sharing gaming, the enterprise will be interested in continuing the knowledge-sharing. It is especially the case that under market supervision enterprise's knowledge will be a voluntary act. In order to efficiently upgrade enterprise's knowledge-sharing ability, enterprises should pay close attention to the optimization of knowledge transfer process, to the establishment of knowledge warning system, and respond actively to the market supervision.},

To enhance the knowledge value, businesses have to promote knowledge sharing as the path to gaining competitive advantages. Further, with the rapid progress in network technology, new business models have emerged to adapt to the changing environment; the virtual team, a kind of new business style, has become prevalent for many businesses in emerging information technologies. In this study, we study how the virtual team members effectively share their knowledge through the network technology. Based on the Social Exchange Theory and a model of shared knowledge, we explore the critical factors and causal relationships among knowledge sharing on virtual team. The findings show that the total eight hypotheses have been confirmed and are valid. Thus, these findings could be good references for both academics and in practice. Based upon the research findings, implications and limitations are discussed.},

abstract = {Previous research indicated that task conflict benefits knowledge sharing within organization, whereas relationship conflict damages it. However, little is known about the underlying psychological process by which task and relationship conflicts have distinct effects on knowledge sharing. In this study, we aim to open the "black box" in the relationship between conflict and knowledge sharing. This paper presents a mediational model of knowledge sharing and tests how three psychological states (psychological meaningfulness, availability, and safety) and knowledge workers' engagement mediate the effects of two types of conflict on knowledge sharing. Results of a study of 144 knowledge workers showed that task conflicts have positive effects on three psychological states, while relationship conflicts have negative effects. Furthermore, three psychological states affected workers' engagement and knowledge sharing behaviors. The results supported an integrative perspective on how workers' psychological processes affected workers' knowledge sharing behavior in different conflict contexts.},

abstract = {Chatbots are becoming increasingly popular due to their benefits in saving costs, time, and effort. This is due to the fact that they allow users to communicate and control different services easily through natural language. Chatbot development requires special expertise (e.g., machine learning and conversation design) that differ from the development of traditional software systems. At the same time, the challenges that chatbot developers face remain mostly unknown since most of the existing studies focus on proposing chatbots to perform particular tasks rather than their development.Therefore, in this paper, we examine the Q&amp;A website, Stack Overflow, to provide insights on the topics that chatbot developers are interested and the challenges they face. In particular, we leverage topic modeling to understand the topics that are being discussed by chatbot developers on Stack Overflow. Then, we examine the popularity and difficulty of those topics. Our results show that most of the chatbot developers are using Stack Overflow to ask about implementation guidelines. We determine 12 topics that developers discuss (e.g., Model Training) that fall into five main categories. Most of the posts belong to chatbot development, integration, and the natural language understanding (NLU) model categories. On the other hand, we find that developers consider the posts of building and integrating chatbots topics more helpful compared to other topics. Specifically, developers face challenges in the training of the chatbot's model. We believe that our study guides future research to propose techniques and tools to help the community at its early stages to overcome the most popular and difficult topics that practitioners face when developing chatbots.},

abstract = {Knowledge creation and sharing in organizations is most often assumed to involve direct interactions. It is true that the creation of shared knowledge is really only feasible when people share and improvise local practices, through membership of the same workgroup. However, organizational innovation frequently involves a range of different stakeholder groups, spanning many different domains of professional practice. Definitions of "valid" and "relevant" knowledge become subject to negotiation and joint improvisation. This is reflected not only in discourse, but in the resources that mediate boundary-spanning interactions. This exploratory study analyzes how technical and organizational resources provided mediation of knowledge between different work-groups and how different forms of mediation led to the adaptation of the information systems that they defined and use in common.},

Various tools are frequently used in meetings to support knowledge sharing, ranging from pen-and-paper to whiteboards and other shared workspaces. This paper reports on a user study that investigated how private and shared displays affect knowledge sharing processes in co-located meetings. Three setups were compared in a hidden-profile experiment: a distributed system providing a shared display and laptops (Note&amp;Share), a regular whiteboard and pen-and-paper. The results show several advantages of the distributed system. For example, the group was more confident in the solution when using Note&amp;Share. Furthermore the number of shared arguments was significantly closer to the correct number, which suggests that misunderstandings occurred less frequently. Finally some interesting effects were observed, which we claim to be connected to the availability of pen-and-paper in all conditions. Therefore, we discuss the observed effects as well as general lessons learned from this experiment.},

abstract = {Becoming an expert at programming is thought to take an estimated 10,000 hours of deliberate practice . But what happens after that? Do programming experts continue to develop, do they plateau, or is there a decline at some point? A diversity of opinion exists on this matter, but many seem to think that aging brings a decline in adoption and absorption of new programming knowledge. We develop several research questions on this theme, and draw on data from StackOverflow to address these questions. The goal of this research is to support career planning and staff development for programmers by identifying age-related trends in StackOverflow data. We observe that programmer reputation scores increase relative to age well into the 50’s, that programmers in their 30’s tend to focus on fewer areas relative to those younger or older in age, and that there is not a strong correlation between age and scores in specific knowledge areas.},

abstract = {In a Product Life Cycle (PLC) scenario, different Virtual Engineering Applications (VEA) are used in order to design, calculate and, in general, to provide an application scenario for computation engineering. The diverse VEA are not necessarily available when information sharing is needed, a fact that represents a semantic loss as the knowledge gained by using one VEA can be lost if a data translation occurs (e.g. a Finite Element program is normally able to export only the geometry). In this paper we present an architecture and a system implementation based on semantic technologies which allows a seamless information and knowledge sharing between VEA in a PLC scenario. Our approach is validated through a Plant Layout Design application which is able to collect knowledge provided by different VEA available. This work presents our system leaving a statistical analysis for future work, as at the moment our system is being tested.},

It studies different barriers for knowledge sharing as well as incentive programs that are aiming to motivate employees to engage in the knowledge sharing activity. Finally it presents a new Peer-to-Peer (P2P) knowledge sharing paradigm and the architecture of a mobile peer-to-peer knowledge sharing system. The proposed P2P knowledge sharing paradigm addresses the major issues of mobile communication as well as human aspects of social interactions. It supports communities and utilizes strengths of peer-to-peer social networks. The system implementation proves technical feasibility of the proposed approach.},

Winning or losing arguments are not important; the amount of valid information shared between the arguers during rational debate qualifies for the scope of discussion. Proponent's arguments explain one's thoughts or beliefs to the opponent. The knowledge shared by the proponent may be invalid or inconsistent with respect to the opponent's common sense knowledge. Therefore, the opponent reverts rationally through a counter- argument. The proponent then removes the contradictions and proposes subsequent argument to the opponent. This exchange of propositions or arguments continues until the participant(s) is convinced about the shared knowledge. The validity of the shared knowledge shall be evaluated by measuring the components of the participants' knowledge base.},

Compared to other interest groups, technical SIG groups require more beneficial communications and materials to be shared among the members. However, they may encounter a lot of challenges to draw the interest among the members in sharing their knowledge voluntarily. A lot of knowledge sharing researches focuses on how to develop a knowledge sharing system. Hence, they overlook the need to integrate social aspects in the design of such systems. As the result, the systems face inactive participants among the members. In fact, the most crucial part of developing such online communities is on how to encourage users to contribute and share their knowledge. We must discover the underlying problems on why the users are reluctant to share their knowledge through the knowledge sharing system. This paper discusses the survey conducted in order to gain users’ perspectives towards such systems for SIG.},

abstract = {Background: Docker technology has been increasingly used among software developers in a multitude of projects. This growing interest is due to the fact that Docker technology supports a convenient process for creating and building containers, promoting close cooperation between developer and operations teams, and enabling continuous software delivery. As a fast-growing technology, it is important to identify the Docker-related topics that are most popular as well as existing challenges and difficulties that developers face.Aims: This paper presents a large-scale empirical study identifying practitioners' perspectives on Docker technology by mining posts from the Stack Overflow (SoF) community. Method: A dataset of 113, 922 Docker-related posts was created based on a set of relevant tags and contents. The dataset was cleaned and prepared. Topic modelling was conducted using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), allowing the identification of dominant topics in the domain. Results: Our results show that most developers use SoF to ask about a broad spectrum of Docker topics including framework development, application deployment, continuous integration, web-server configuration and many more. We determined that 30 topics that developers discuss can be grouped into 13 main categories. Most of the posts belong to categories of application development, configuration, and networking. On the other hand, we find that the posts on monitoring status, transferring data, and authenticating users are more popular among developers compared to the other topics. Specifically, developers face challenges in web browser issues, networking error and memory management. Besides, there is a lack of experts in this domain. Conclusion: Our research findings will guide future work on the development of new tools and techniques, helping the community to focus efforts and understand existing trade-offs on Docker topics.},

Above all, we seek to intensify our PLS model by using Bayesian network (BN) approach as an ancillary role. Beyond managers' control, we emphasize a voluntarily and informally emergent structure and introduce a social network perspective within team creativity. In this sense, we propose a new integrative team creativity model in which shared leadership, interpersonal trust and knowledge sharing are included and their subsequent influence on team creativity is analyzed. For the sake of empirical analysis, an e-learning course was administered in a private university, and 40 teams were organized for this study. 249 valid questionnaires were garnered, and initially analyzed by PLS (Partial least squares) model. Then, we suggested a new PLS model based on the results of Bayesian networks, and confirmed the successful application of our proposed approach.},

Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) tools represent a key platform to support knowledge sharing at multi-disciplinary design teams working under collaborative engineering concepts. However, an important issue is to capture valuable expertise at collaborative work using the PLM platform reusing key knowledge. This paper contributes to knowledge management showing how the usage of knowledge structures at a PLM environment is suitable for assembly engineering applications. The present research encompasses multidisciplinary engineering work teams defining the assembly process of an airplane part. This paper argues that knowledge structures enable the capture and exchange of expertise at collaborative work increasing value added between collaborators.

Knowledge sharing behavior between exchange students and native students is of great importance for knowledge innovation, international friendship enhancement, the understanding of cultural differences, and the abandonment of prejudices. The theory of planned behavior (TPB), which is generally accepted in the study of human behavior, is used in this paper. Based on TPB, this paper constructed a concrete model of the elements which influence the knowledge sharing behavior between the exchange and the native students. This TPB-based model helped to propose several measures from four aspects to promote the knowledge sharing behavior discussed in this paper.},

abstract = {In this demonstration, we introduce a novel web-based intelligent interface which automatically detects and highlights programming content (programming code and messages) in Q&amp;A programming forums. We expect our interface helps enhancing visual presentation of such forum content and enhance effective participation.We solve this problem using several alternative approaches: a dictionary-based baseline method, a non-sequential Na\"{\i}ve Bayes classification algorithm, and Conditional Random Fields (CRF) which is a sequential labeling framework. The best results are produced by CRF method with an F1-Score of 86.9\%.We also experimentally validate how robust our classifier is by testing the constructed CRF model built on a C++ forum against a Python and a Java dataset. The results indicate the classifier works quite well across different domains.To demonstrate detection results, a web-based graphical user interface is developed that accepts a user input programming forum message and processes it using trained CRF model and then displays the programming content snippets in a different font to the user.},

abstract = {Community question answering (CQA) forums can provide effective means for sharing information and addressing a user's information needs about particular topics. However, many such online forums are not moderated, resulting in many low quality and redundant comments, which makes it very challenging for users to find the appropriate answers to their questions. In this paper, we apply a user-centered design approach to develop a system, CQAVis, which supports users in identifying high quality comments and get their questions answered. Informed by the user's requirements, the system combines both text analytics and interactive visualization techniques together in a synergistic way. Given a new question posed by the user, the text analytic module automatically finds relevant answers by exploring existing related questions and the comments within their threads. Then the visualization module presents the search results to the user and supports the exploration of related comments. We have evaluated the system in the wild by deploying it within a CQA forum among thousands of real users. Through the online study, we gained deeper insights about the potential utility of the system, as well as learned generalizable lessons for designing visual text analytics systems for the domain of CQA forums.},

Although the number of existing ISRM methodologies is enormous, in practice a lot of resources are invested by organizations in creating new ISRM methodologies in order to capture more accurately the risks of their complex information systems. This is a crucial knowledge-intensive process for organizations, but in most cases it is addressed in an ad hoc manner. The existence of a systematic approach for the development of new or improvedI SRM methodologies would enhance the effectiveness of the process. In this paper we propose a systematic meta-process for developing new, or improved ISRM methods. We also present the specifications for a collaboration and knowledge-sharing platform supporting a virtual intra-organizational cross disciplinary team, which aims at improving its ISRM methodologies by adopting the proposed metaprocess.},

These knowledge sharing techniques are ‘Shared Memory', ‘Adaptive Weighted Strategy Sharing', ‘Exploration Guided Method', and ‘Greatest Mass Method'. Different robot expertness measures are applied to these knowledge sharing techniques in order to improve learning performance. We proposed a new robot expertness measure based on regret evaluation. The regret takes uncertainty bounds of two best actions, i.e. greedy action and the second best action, into account. Simulations were performed to compare the effectiveness of the three expertness measures i.e. expertness based on accumulated rewards, on average move and on regret measure, when applied to different sharing techniques. Our proposed measure resulted in better performance than the other expertness measures. Analysis and comparison of different knowledge sharing techniques are also provided herein.},

publisher = {Digital Government Society of North America},
abstract = {Solving complex global problems such as illegal immigration, border control, and terrorism requires government organizations at all levels to share not only data but, more importantly, knowledge pertinent to decision support, problem solving and activity coordination. Responding to an emergency often requires organizational and inter-organizational policies and complex operating procedures to be followed. In this work, we focus on the sharing of data associated with events of interest to collaborating organizations. Condition-action-alternative-action rules, logic/derivation rules, and constraint rules are used to define organizational and inter-organizational policies, regulations, and data and security constraints. Structures of these heterogeneous rules are used to capture organizational processes and operating procedures. A distributed event-triggered knowledge sharing system enables the interoperation of distributed, heterogeneous rules and rule structures on the data associated with each event occurrence so that all data pertinent to the event occurrence can be generated and delivered to relevant organizations. Presented in this paper are: 1) the system architecture and the distributed event and rule processing strategy, 2) algorithms used for the translation of heterogeneous rules and rule structures into web services for their uniform and efficient processing in a web service infrastructure and 3) issues and solutions related to event data aggregation, conflicting rules, and cyclic rules. The developed user interface tool and system are for deployment in the USDA's National Plant Diagnostics Network to strengthen the homeland security protection of this nation's food and agriculture.},

abstract = {There has been a massive rise in the use of Community Question and Answering (CQA) forums to get solutions to various technical and non-technical queries. One common problem faced in CQA is the small number of experts, which leaves many questions unanswered. This paper addresses the challenging problem of predicting the best answerer for a new question and thereby recommending the best expert for the same. Although there are work in the literature that aim to find possible answerers for questions posted in CQA, very few algorithms exist for finding the best answerer whose answer will satisfy the information need of the original Poster. For finding answerers, existing approaches mostly use features based on content and tags associated with the questions. There are few approaches that additionally consider the users' history. In this paper, we propose an approach that considers a comprehensive set of features including but not limited to text representation, tag based similarity as well as multiple user-based features that target users' availability, agility as well as expertise for predicting the best answerer for a given question. We also include features that give incentives to users who answer less but more important questions over those who answer a lot of questions of less importance. A learning to rank algorithm is used to find the weight of each feature. Experiments conducted on a real dataset from Stack Exchange show the efficacy of the proposed method in terms of multiple evaluation metrics for accuracy, robustness and real time performance.},

This paper aims at investigating how changes occurring to Android APIs trigger questions and activity in StackOverflow, and whether this is particularly true for certain kinds of changes. Our findings suggest that Android developers usually have more questions when the behavior of APIs is modified. In addition, deleting public methods from APIs is a trigger for questions that are (i) more discussed and of major interest for the community, and (ii) posted by more experienced developers. In general, results of this paper provide important insights about the use of social media to learn about changes in software ecosystems, and establish solid foundations for building new recommenders for notifying developers/managers about important changes and recommending them relevant crowdsourced solutions},

However, limited research attention has been given to the individual's salient beliefs about knowledge sharing. This paper aims to study the role of individual's attitude towards knowledge sharing, from a socio-psychological perspective, and how it drives the decision to share knowledge. The paper proposes that an individual's knowledge sharing behavior is driven by a set of salient beliefs that are not unlike the notion of payoff in game theory. Using the case of a telecommunication company in Egypt (will be referred to as company X in this paper), the paper employed multi-person game theoretic structure to determine the game played by the employees. The researcher found that the perceived payoff of knowledge sharing can be characterized by a multi-person game and that drivers of individual's behavior are self esteem, expected association, expected contribution, self consistency, level of understanding, time to share, and self interest.},

In order for an organization to remain competitive, team creativity level should be controlled to stay higher than an average level that rival companies are believed to show. Beyond managers' control, we emphasize a voluntarily and informally emergent structure and introduce a social network perspective within team creativity. Since a team is composed of individual members, and a certain kind of leadership and trust exist in the team to affect team creativity, it is necessary to investigate relationships between leadership, trust and team creativity in a rigorous way. In this sense, we propose a team creativity model in which shared leadership, interpersonal trust (affect-based trust and cognition-based trust), and knowledge-sharing are included and their subsequent influence on team creativity is analyzed. For the sake of empirical analysis, an e-learning course was administered in a private university, and 40 teams were organized for this study. 249 valid questionnaires were garnered, and analyzed by structural equation model. Results show that shared leadership, knowledge sharing and cognition-based trust significantly influence team creativity.},

Such APIs look and feel like conventional APIs but abstract away data-driven probabilistic behaviour---the implications of a developer treating these APIs in the same way as other, traditional cloud services, such as cloud storage, is of concern. The objective of this study is to determine the various pain-points developers face when implementing systems that rely on the most mature of these intelligent services, specifically those that provide computer vision. We use Stack Overflow to mine indications of the frustrations that developers appear to face when using computer vision services, classifying their questions against two recent classification taxonomies (documentation-related and general questions). We find that, unlike mature fields like mobile development, there is a contrast in the types of questions asked by developers. These indicate a shallow understanding of the underlying technology that empower such systems. We discuss several implications of these findings via the lens of learning taxonomies to suggest how the software engineering community can improve these services and comment on the nature by which developers use them.},

This paper discusses the sharing of mutually-complementary knowledge resources across organizations in the competitive strategic alliance as well as the conditions of maintaining their cooperation. The result indicates that, under the Nash balanced condition, the knowledge sharing level increases along with the expansion of the sharing cost effect. The optimum knowledge sharing coefficient is in directly proportional to the structure of the marginal cost of the whole alliances and every alliance member; it is inversely proportional to the every alliance member’s absorption coefficient on knowledge shared; it is in inversely proportional to the investment cost paid by every alliance member on acquire knowledge.},

abstract = {Annotating documents with keywords or ‘tags’ is useful for categorizing documents and helping users find a document efficiently and quickly. Question and answer (Q&amp;A) sites also use tags to categorize questions to help ensure that their users are aware of questions related to their areas of expertise or interest. However, someone asking a question may not necessarily know the best way to categorize or tag the question, and automatically tagging or categorizing a question is a challenging task. Since a Q&amp;A site may host millions of questions with tags and other data, this information can be used as a training and test dataset for approaches that automatically suggest tags for new questions. In this paper, we mine data from millions of questions from the Q&amp;A site Stack Overflow, and using a discriminative model approach, we automatically suggest question tags to help a questioner choose appropriate tags for eliciting a response.},

The focal point of the DLN performance is efficiency of knowledge processing in asynchronous learning mode and facilitating cooperation between students. In addition, the DLN articulates attention to social aspects of the learning process as well. In this paper, a method for the DLN development is proposed. The main research objectives for the proposed method are the processes of acceleration of social collaboration and knowledge sharing in the DLN. The method introduces knowledge-disposed agents (who represent students in educational scenarios) that form a network of individuals aimed to increase their competence. For every agent the competence expansion process is formulated. Based on that outcome the process of dynamic network formation performed on the social and knowledge levels. The method utilizes formal apparatuses of competence set and network game theories combined with an agent system-based approach.},

The “global knowledge grid” is as an infrastructure that is suitable for implementing knowledge cluster systems on the basis of the three-site model. The knowledge cluster systems build an evolving network of community knowledge by connecting heterogeneous knowledge bases. The “global risk management system” is being developed as an application of the knowledge cluster systems.},

abstract = {At present, question-answer (QA) sites have become one of the most important sources of information sharing. In order to ease search and categorization, QA sites create communities to discuss a specific topic or interest. As a consequence, a large number of communities have been created in the last few years. A lot of research has been conducted on community QA sites to address various problems including expert identification and tag recommendation. However, an important problem that has been neglected so far is to automatically route a question to the right community. In this paper, we propose a novel word-embedding based method to route a question to the right community. We use syntactic as well as semantic features to characterize a question and community. Although this approach of characterization performs well, it is highly computationally expensive. To deal with this problem, we use topic modeling, which effectively summarizes a community and reduces the computation time. Our experimental results reveal that usage of both syntactic and semantic features helps in question routing and leads to a better community prediction. We evaluate our methods on a well-known question answering system Stack Exchange and show the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

The scalability is provided through the concepts of topic-tree, class, minder and domain, all of which can change dynamically without requiring any action from the peer users. An associated central issue covered is integration technique and integration compatibility of ontologies.},

The result shows that the manufacturer’s participation level in knowledge sharing and developing is a function of the ratio between dyadic marginal profits of the logistics collaboration performance, which is independent to the prior efforts of both sides. And the condition for manufacturer participating collaboration was identified. Then, the influence of prior efforts in logistics knowledge creation from two parts on system parameter was investigated as well.},

The case was a three-year-long IOIS project spanning nine organizations altogether. The data were collected by interviews, observations of project meetings, diaries, project memoranda and emails sent by project members to each other during these years. We demonstrate how power and status colors experiences about the knowledge sharing and knowledge building work in an IOIS project.

It has been shown that the impression of the statements could be captured by nine factors, and the factor scores could be estimated from the feature values of the statements. Here, the objective scores of answer statements are provided. This paper tries to estimate the objective scores of answer statements through multiple regression analysis. They are estimated from the factor scores estimated by using multiple regression formulas already obtained. Absolute values of the differences between the factor scores of answer statements and those of question ones, those of the answer statements having the highest scores, and those of the ones having the lowest ones, are used as the explanatory variables. It is shown that objective scores of the objective statements could be estimated fairly good, and that those of subjective statements could be estimated well by taking the natural logarithm of the factor scores.},

abstract = {Background. C# maintains type safety and security by not allowing direct dangerous pointer arithmetic. To improve performance for special cases, pointer arithmetic is provided via an unsafe context. Programmers can use the C# unsafe keyword to encapsulate a code block, which can use pointer arithmetic. In the Common Language Runtime (CLR), unsafe code is referred to as unverifiable code. It then becomes the responsibility of the programmer to ensure the encapsulated code snippet is not dangerous. Naturally, this raises concern on whether such trust is misused by programmers when they promote the use of C# unsafe context. Aim. We aim to analyze the prevalence and vulnerabilities of share code examples using C# unsafe keyword in Stack Overflow (SO) code sharing platform. Method. By using some regular expressions and manual checks, we extracted C# unsafe code relevant posts from SO and categorized them into some software development scenarios. Results. In the entire SO data dump of September 2018, we find 2,283 C# snippets with the unsafe keyword. Among those posts, 27\% of posts are about Image processing, where unsafe codes are mainly used for performance reasons. The second most popular category by 21\% of the codes in the posts is used for 'Interoperability' reasons. That is 'unsafe' is used to enable 'Interoperability' between C# managed codes and unmanaged codes. The 'stackalloc' operator is the third category with 9\% of unsafe code posts. The stackalloc operator allocates a block of memory on the stack. Since C# 7.2, Microsoft recommends against using 'stackalloc' in unsafe context whenever possible. Manual inspection shows 67 code snippets with dangerous functions that can introduce vulnerability if not used with caution (e.g., buffer overflow). Finally, 35\% of 'Interoperability' posts have 'P/Invoke' tag were used outside NativeMethods class, which is in contrast to Microsoft design suggestion. Conclusion. Our study leads to 7 main findings, and these findings show the importance of cautiously using this feature.},

This study aims to research the factors of students' knowledge sharing of health technology in universities of technology, validating a scale to measure the current situation for students' knowledge sharing of health technology and to test some models of constructing students' knowledge sharing of health technology. To achieve this goal, the following methods were adopted: literature review, Delphi survey, professional interview and sampling questionnaire survey (2,451 students from 14 technology universities in Taiwan) to examine the students' knowledge sharing of health technology. The results showed that the students' knowledge sharing of health technology consisted of behavior norm, sharing attitude, sharing intention, sharing behavior and sharing control in terms of the theory of planning behavior (TPB). The models of students' knowledge sharing of health technology were tested with good fit through structural equation modeling (SEM). Since the path correlation of model was based on TPB, the following hypotheses concerning the students' knowledge sharing behavior were supported: sharing attitude toward sharing intention, behavioral norm toward sharing intention, behavioral control toward sharing intention, sharing intention toward sharing behavior, and behavioral control toward sharing behavior, which all had positive effects. Finally, conclusions and suggestions were proposed for all forms of teaching, such as embedded teaching in health technological literacy, the methods of research and statistics, the policy of promoting students to the holistic health, and further researches including a bridge building between the universities of technology and industries for teachers and practitioners, then constructing a significant wireless connectivity of knowledge sharing with hardware and software of mobile learning in health technology should be considered.},

We conducted a pilot study to explore what factors would affect the use of these knowledge sharing features. The results demonstrate that knowledge sharing in general is preferred by only some subjects for some tasks. For those who preferred sharing they share search queries, domain knowledge, and search results, rather than the usefulness judgment. The findings also show that knowledge sharing does not seem to have effects on search performance. However, it is significantly associated with the perceived task difficulty. The possible reasons leading to these results are analyzed. Limitations of this study are pointed out and the future studies are discussed.},

In this paper we focus on knowledge sharing (KS) and trust as important factors for building a sustainable online learning community (OLC). Guided by theories of social learning and social networking, we survey graduate students to assess their perceptions of KS and trust in communities of practice (CoPs). These results are compared against posttest results measuring community building and knowledge sharing in a stakeholder-defined OLC. Results indicate that although students' initial assessment of KS and trust in CoPs were low, users perceived high levels of value from a stakeholder-defined OLC. Our research offers a proof-of-concept that stakeholder-defined OLCs provide students with the opportunity to develop knowledge networks, while also providing for individual autonomy over their content. Our results also indicate an intriguing alternative to traditional course management systems (CMS).},

abstract = {StackOverflow.com (SO) is a Question and Answer service oriented to support collaboration among developers in order to help them solving their issues related to software development. In SO, developers post questions related to a programming topic and other members of the site can provide answers to help them. The information available on this type of service is also known as "crowd knowledge" and currently is one important trend in supporting activities related to software development and maintenance.  We present an approach that makes use of "crowd knowledge" available in SO to recommend information that can assist developers in their activities. This strategy recommends a ranked list of pairs of questions/answers from SO based on a query (list of terms). The ranking criteria is based on two main aspects: the textual similarity of the pairs with respect to the query (the developer's problem) and the quality of the pairs. Moreover, we developed a classifier to consider only "how-to" posts. We conducted an experiment considering programming problems on three different topics (Swing, Boost and LINQ) widely used by the software development community to evaluate the proposed recommendation strategy. The results have shown that for 77.14\% of the assessed activities, at least one recommended pair proved to be useful concerning the target programming problem. Moreover, for all activities, at least one recommended pair had a source code snippet considered reproducible or almost reproducible.},

We explore this learning process in four different SQAs that utilize the Stack Exchange platform: Science Fiction \&amp; Fantasy, Seasoned Advice (cooking), Database Administrators, and Android Enthusiasts. Using longitudinal fixed effects models, we examine whether users learn to be better question askers over time, and how user interface features and community norms affect the cultivation of this critical skill.

Method: We have analyzed 12,989 questions and answers posted on Stack Overflow. Topic modelling is conducted to derive the dominant topics in this domain. Further, a qualitative analysis was conducted to identify the key challenges discussed. Findings: Whilst the trend of posted questions is sharply increasing, the questions are becoming more specific to technologies and more difficult to attract answers. We identified 32 topics of discussions, among which "Error messages in Continuous Integration/Deployment" and "Continuous Integration concepts" are the most dominant. We also present the most challenging areas in this domain from the practitioners' perspectives.},

This paper advances present knowledge about Q&amp;A sites using a multifaceted view of contributors that accounts for diversity of behavior, motivation and expertise to characterize their profiles in five sites. This characterization resulted in the definition of ten behavioral profiles that group users according to the quality and quantity of their contributions. Using these profiles, we find that the five sites have remarkably similar distributions of contributor profiles. We also conduct a longitudinal study of contributor profiles in one of the sites, identifying common profile transitions, and finding that although users change profiles with some frequency, the site composition is mostly stable over time.},

Furthermore, to settle down the conflict situation, participation of Third Party which treated as the complement is assumed, and the relationship between the role of Third Party and equilibriums of Conflict Analysis is analyzed.

abstract = {Current techniques for cyclone detection and tracking employ NCEP (National Centers for Environmental Prediction) models from in-situ measurements. This solution does not provide true global coverage, unlike remote satellite observations. However it is impractical to use a single Earth orbiting satellite to detect and track events such as cyclones in a continuous manner due to limited spatial and temporal coverage. One solution to alleviate such persistent problems is to utilize heterogeneous sensor data from multiple orbiting satellites. However, this solution requires overcoming other new challenges such as varying spatial and temporal resolution between satellite sensor data, the need to establish correspondence between features from different satellite sensors, and the lack of definitive indicators for cyclone events in some sensor data.We describe an automated cyclone discovery and tracking approach using heterogeneous near real-time sensor data from multiple satellites. This approach addresses the unique challenges associated with knowledge discovery and mining from heterogeneous satellite data streams. We consider two remote sensor measurements in our current implementation, namely: QuikSCAT wind satellite measurements, and merged precipitation data from TRMM and other satellites. More satellites will be incorporated in the near future and our solution is sufficiently powerful that it generalizes to multiple sensor measurement modalities. Our approach consists of three main components: (i) feature extraction from each sensor measurement, (ii) an ensemble classifier for cyclone discovery, and (iii) knowledge sharing between the different remote sensor measurements based on a linear Kalman filter for predictive cyclone tracking. Experimental results on historical hurricane datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our approach compared to previous work.},

abstract = {Stack Overflow is one of the most popular online programming question and answer websites for developers around the world. Generally, developers need to provide tags for their posting. High-quality tags are expected to facilitate correct classification and efficient search. Unfortunately, tagging process is distributed and uncoordinated due to developers' understanding of their postings, English skills and preferences. Automatic tag recommendation becomes increasingly important for these information sites. In this paper, we propose SOTagRec, a novel tag recommendation approach combing convolutional neural network model and collaborative filtering method. By learning historical postings and their tags from existing information, SOTagRec can accurately infer tags for new postings. We have evaluated SOTagRec on Stackoverflow and compare with the state-of-the-art methods. Experiments Results show that SOTagRec achieves 81.7\% and 88.7\% respectively for Recall@5 and Recall@10, which outperforms the previous relevant methods.},

This article analyzes the influences of organizational culture, structure, and IT on employee knowledge sharing capabilities in five public and five private sector organizations in South Korea. According to the data, social networks, performance-based reward systems, and employee usage of IT applications are significant variables affecting employee knowledge sharing activities in the public and private organizations that were the focus of this study. Furthermore, the data show that while IT application usage is the most important factor determining employee knowledge sharing capabilities in the five government ministries, an end-user IT focus is the most important factor influencing knowledge sharing abilities in the five private-sector corporations. The results also indicate that the surveyed private sector employees have stronger perceptions of knowledge sharing abilities in their organizations compared to the surveyed public sector employees. Lessons and implications of this study for management leadership are presented.},

In this paper, we study a particular type of trolling, performed by asking a provocative question on a community question-answering website. By combining user reports with subsequent moderator deletions, we identify a set of over 400,000 troll questions on Yahoo Answers, i.e., questions aimed to inflame, upset, and draw attention from others on the community. This set of troll questions spans a lengthy period of time and a diverse set of topical categories. Our analysis reveals unique characteristics of troll questions when compared to "regular" questions, with regards to their metadata, text, and askers. A classifier built upon these features reaches an accuracy of 85\% over a balanced dataset. The answers' text and metadata, reflecting the community's response to the question, are found particularly productive for the classification task.},

abstract = {The management of information security risk is a major concern of organizations worldwide. Although the number of existing information security risk management methodologies is enormous, in practice a lot of resources are invested by organizations in creating new information security risk management methodologies. This is a crucial knowledge-intensive process for organizations, but in most cases it is addressed in an ad hoc manner. We believe that the existence of a systematic approach for the development of new (and the improvement of existing) information security risk management methodologies would enhance the effectiveness of the process. In this paper we propose a systematic meta-process for developing new, or improving existing, information security risk management methods. We also present our vision for a collaboration and knowledge-sharing platform capable of supporting a virtual intra-organizational cross-disciplinary team, which aims at improving information security risk management methodologies by adopting the proposed meta-process.},

As a result, increasingly more organizations are focusing on real time knowledge sharing and collaboration. This paper explores the impact of collaborative software on an online community's control structure and subsequently on knowledge sharing in that community.Using a framework comprising theories of Legitimate Peripheral Participation and Weak-ties, we analyzed self-organizing online communities (e.g., weblog networks) and centralized online communities (e.g., discussion forums communities) with respect to the efficacy of knowledge sharing in these communities. Findings of this study indicate that self-organizing communities of practice facilitate more weak-ties among their members than centralized communities. These findings suggest that self-organizing communities would facilitate greater dissemination of knowledge among their members than centralized communities. Abundance of weak-ties in the self-organizing communities also makes these communities better environments for the discovery of new information.},

Unlike typical forum comments that are displayed with user names below videos, danmaku comments are overlaid on the screen of videos without showing users' information. Prior work studied forum comments and danmaku separately, and little work compared how these two features were used. We collected 38,399 danmaku comments and 16,414 forum comments posted in 2017 on 30 popular videos on Bilibili.com. We examined the usage of these two features in terms of user participation, language used, and ways of sharing knowledge. We found that more users posted danmaku comments, and they also posted these more frequently than forum comments. Even though, in total, more negative language was used in danmaku comments than in forum comments, active users appeared to post more positive comments in danmaku. There was no such correlation in forum comments. It is interesting to find that danmaku and forum comments enabled knowledge sharing in a complementary manner, where danmaku comments involved more explicit knowledge sharing and forum comments exhibited more tacit knowledge sharing. We discuss design implications to promote social interactions for online video systems.},

In this paper, several fuzzy Q-learning methods for knowledge sharing i.e. Shared Memory, Weighted Strategy Sharing (WSS) and Adaptive Weighted Strategy Sharing (AdpWSS) are studied. A new measure of expertise based on regret evaluation is proposed. Regret measure takes uncertainty bounds of two best actions, i.e. the greedy action and the second best action into account. Knowledge sharing simulations and experiments on real robots were performed to compare the effectiveness of the three expertness measures i.e. Gradient (G), Average Move (AM) and our proposed measure. The proposed measure exhibited the best performance among the three measures. Moreover, our measure that is applied to the AdpWSS does not require the predefined setting of cooperative time, thus it is more practical to be implemented in real-world problems.},

The research was conducted with undergraduate students through questionnaire and analysis methods to test all the proposed research hypotheses. And research model was evaluated with structural equation modeling. Results of this empirical study indicated that computer self-efficacy, Internet self-efficacy and personal outcome expectation positively affect undergraduate students’ knowledge sharing in learning virtual communities. However, community-related outcome expectation has no significant effect on knowledge sharing. Finally, conclusion and implications of these findings were also discussed.},

abstract = {How-to tutorials and videos are valuable for self-learning. While it is common for task instructors to produce tutorials alone, sharing knowledge when performing physical tasks without external support can be challenging to the experts. The resulting tutorials may also appear incomprehensible to learners who are not involved in the process of tutorial generation. We investigate cued-knowledge sharing, which pairs instructors with partners of different levels of expertise who also participate tutorial generation and give cues (prompts, questions etc.) to the instructors to facilitate their knowledge externalization. In a laboratory study, experienced cooks performed a cooking task and think aloud with cues from three types of paired partners, another experienced cook, a novice cook, or no partner. We noted that experts produced more clarifications when being paired with novice-partners than experienced-partners. The results demonstrate that (1) having a partner participate and provide cues may influence the content of knowledge sharing, and (2) even if the partner doesn't know much about the task (i.e., novice), their external cues remain helpful, which shed light on developing intelligent support for instructors' tutorial generation in the procedural and physical domains.},

Through a case study of engineering groups at a U.S. based manufacturing plant, we found that both formal and informal boundary spanning mechanisms had a positive effect on the ability of dispersed groups to identify and transfer remotely situated knowledge from other sites. However, we also found that the formal boundary spanning mechanism may have a suppressing effect on the informal boundary spanning mechanism when jointly pursued in certain circumstances. The findings call into question the implicit view of the boundary spanner and virtual team literatures that has largely portrayed the effects of both mechanisms on cross-boundary knowledge transfer as independent or complementary.},

Much discussion is required to utilize the collected incidents effectively in the incident analysis activity. On-line Computer Mediated Communication(CMC) activity is an appropriate circumstance for geographically dispersed workers in nuclear power plants to discuss about the incident analysis. Some studies, however, indicate that the discussion activity in CMC tends to stagnate after a short period of time. For this study, the authors developed a discussion system for knowledge sharing and collaborative analysis of incidents, and proposed a method to promote discussion among users through introduction of "Active Participant". The Active Participant always behaves actively, and such behaviors are expected to promote the other members' incident analysis in the discussion group. To evaluate the effectiveness of the introduction of the Active Participant and obtain concrete guidance of the Active Participant, an experiment was conducted with nuclear power plant workers who were asked to evaluate the discussion system. The results of the experiment show that Active Participant can promote discussion among group members if enough number of incidents are submitted to the discussion system.},

abstract = {Programs such as CS10K and CS for All in the United States seek to increase the number of CS teachers and provide training to them, highlighting the need to understand how best to support teachers at disadvantaged schools. Compared with teachers at larger or more affluent schools, they are less likely to gain CS pedagogical content knowledge (PCK) through methods such as face to face conversations, attending conferences, or observing a colleague's class. However CS PCK is necessary for successful teaching and learning, and research has shown that teachers want opportunities to engage in reflective practice with peers. Thus teachers at underserved or isolated schools must rely on other methods to discuss and share CS PCK. We explore this problem by examining the current landscape of online resources used for this purpose. Data was collected from two online communication fora---one with lightly moderated content devoted to general CS education matters, and one with highly curated content devoted entirely to CS PCK. We analyze the strengths and weaknesses of both fora, and synthesize our results by examining design recommendations for an online CS PCK resource that would capture the benefits of both environments.},

abstract = {Based on the supposition that enterprise employees are rationality-bounded, this paper establishes an evolutionary game model of knowledge sharing inside enterprise. We can get the evolutionary stable point of the model by calculation. By the analysis of the position of the stable point, we can find out the key factors which should be focused upon during the design of knowledge sharing incentive mechanism inside the enterprise. We submit a major argument that an appropriate incentive mechanism with the proper focusing factors could make the knowledge sharing of an enterprise evolve toward a state which is satisfied by enterprise managers.},

abstract = {Knowledge sharing is an important part in knowledge management. The value of knowledge only can be seen in its transfer, sharing and utilizing. The transfer of individual tacit knowledge to organizational capacity can improve the competitiveness of a organization. However, there are a lot of barriers in knowledge sharing, especially in those knowledge-intensive organizations, where knowledge is very important for individuals to keep advantage, so they are usually unwilling to share it with others, or ‘contribute’ their personal knowledge to the organization. At present, most studies are emphasizing on how to create a good physical environment and platform to improve it. In this paper, we’ll analyze it using game theory. We think that to improve the efficiency of knowledge sharing efficiency, motivation mechanism and physical platform must be improved simultaneously, especially in knowledge-intensive organization, motivation mechanism is more important. Then, to problem of ‘prisoner’ dilemma’ between individuals knowledge sharing, this paper will show how to design motivation method to improve efficiency of it.},

Owing to strong ties and vertical division, hub-and-spoke clusters have advantage on cooperative innovation, knowledge creation and knowledge sharing. Our aim is to propose an analytical framework on the knowledge sharing behavior in hub-and-spoke industrial clusters based on evolutionary game theory. Firstly, this paper establishes an evolutionary game model of knowledge sharing behavior of clustering firms. Secondly, it analyzes how the evolution and the evolutionary stable strategy (ESS) are influenced by the characteristics and the network structure of hub-and-spoke industrial clusters. Finally, this paper focuses on factors affecting the choice of knowledge sharing strategy in hub-and-spoke industrial clusters, such as: absorptive capabilities, knowledge gaps, organizational distance, uncertainy, trust and so on.},

The results show that virtual community culture has direct positive impact on group cohesion but no direct positive impact on knowledge sharing. In addition, group cohesion plays an intermediary role between virtual community culture and knowledge sharing, and has direct positive impact on knowledge sharing, which indicates that group cohesion is very important to Chinese netizens for knowledge sharing activity under the rapid changed environment of knowledge economy.},

Arguing that 'given enough answers all questions are answered successfully,' this paper identifies the optimal number of posts that generate high quality answers. Based on content analysis of Yahoo!

Then, a fuzzy ontology framework is presented, including three parts: concepts, properties of concepts and values of properties. The application, which uses fuzzy ontology to model customer and product knowledge in supply chain, shows that these models can overcome the localization of other fuzzy ontology models, and this research facilitates the fuzzy knowledge sharing and reuse on the Semantic Web.},

abstract = {In this demo, we present VIZ-Wiki, a browser extension which generates an overview of summarizable threads in Question Answering forums. It reduces a user's effort to go through lengthy text-based, sarcastic and highly critiqued answers. Our tool can be used to collect community opinion from popular discussion sites like Quora, Yahoo! Answers, Reddit etc. as well as topic-centric ones such as Askubuntu, Stackoverflow. We rely on textual information of these forums to extract insightful summaries for a reader. VIZ-Wiki provides users a pie-graph view marking popular choices when such a question link is raised. A button guides them to detailed statistics and relevant list of answers. It further highlights sentences relevant to an answer choice in the text. VIZ-Wiki deals with answers contradicted by other users, prioritizes highly-recommended ones and avoids sarcasm. We test our model on the factoid questions dataset of Yahoo! Answers and obtain a macro precision of 0.6 on displayed answers and a macro recall of 0.69, beating the baseline significantly. To the best of our knowledge, VIZ-Wiki is the first attempt to visualize answers for questions in community question answering services. In the spirit of reproducibility, we have released the code and a demonstration video public at urlhttp://goo.gl/cyx3EF and urlhttps://youtu.be/XNmRa_jtmC8 respectively},

And we developed a prototype of the proposed system as a web-based user interface for personal knowledge management. This system presents a personal knowledge directory to a registered user. Such a directory has a personal ontology to integrate and classify the knowledge collected by a user from the Web. And the knowledge sharing activities among registered users generate partial reputation factors of knowledge items, their domain nodes, users and groups. Then new users can obtain the knowledge items proper to their needs, by referring such reputation values of those elements. In addition, users can also take the stem that is a set of common knowledge items over the domains designated by them. Thus proposed system can prevent cold-start problem because our knowledge recommendation mechanisms depend on the results of the collaborative knowledge sharing activities among users.},

A systematic analysis on how frequently insecure coding practices appear in SO answers can help the SO community assess the prevalence of insecure Python code blocks in SO. An insecure coding practice is recurrent use of insecure coding patterns in Python. We conduct an empirical study using 529,054 code blocks collected from Python-related 44,966 answers posted on SO. We observe 7.1\% of the 44,966 Python-related answers to include at least one insecure coding practice. The most frequently occurring insecure coding practice is code injection. We observe 9.8\% of the 7,444 accepted answers to include at least one insecure code block. We also find user reputation not to relate with the presence of insecure code blocks, suggesting that both high and low-reputed users are likely to introduce insecure code blocks.},

abstract = {A firm's innovative capabilities depend on its ability to learn from the environment. To learn from the environment a firm must have access to external knowledge, and it must have the absorptive capacity to identify, assimilate and exploit such knowledge. While previous research recognized that firms must invest to acquire absorptive capacity, it assumed that access to knowledge spillovers is free, or a perfectly correlated component of R&amp;D investments. We argue that a firm must also invest in developing organizational routines that search for and acquire access to knowledge spillover. In order to explore the relationship between own-knowledge development and search, we examine the relationship between software firms' R&amp;D investments and their position within the patent citation network and their subsequent knowledge development and financial performance. The results show that a firm's position within the knowledge flow of the industry helps predict knowledge development and financial performance.},

abstract = {Exploiting software vulnerabilities, such as stack overflow, heap overflow, and format string exploits, enables attackers to break into victim machines. Moreover, attackers tend to use obfuscation techniques, such as encryption, to evade intrusion detection systems. In this paper, we show that a common stack-overflow attack, namely the return-to-libc attack, coupled with a common defense, namely the Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR), together allow for constructing a key-agreement protocol that allows two entities (e.g., a Trojan and a controller) to agree on a shared key, whereas the shared key can then be used to encrypt further communication. We have developed a prototype of our key-agreement protocol to evaluate its feasibility and performance. Our results show that both time and message overhead of our protocol are linear in key length. Although our key-agreement protocol can be used by attackers for malicious purposes, it has low computation overhead, making it a candidate for adoption in CPU-constrained platforms.},

Some researchers have separately studied the effect of knowledge sharing behavior and social aspect of system design on E-commerce trust. But researchers seldom further investigate the intermediating role of knowledge sharing between system design and E-commerce trust. From a knowledge sharing perspective, a theoretical model for relationship between system design, knowledge sharing and E-commerce trust is proposed. This model is examined through an empirical study involving 203 subjects using structural equation modeling techniques.

We operationalize these attributes using common metrics and apply statistical modeling to empirically quantify and validate the strength of these signals. Our results are based on a rich dataset of 3,831,147 users and their activities spanning nearly a decade since the site's inception in 2008. We present evidence that certain non-trivial badges, reputation scores and age of the user on the site positively correlate with popularity and impact. Further, we find that the presence of costly to earn and hard to observe signals qualitatively differentiates highly impactful users from highly popular users.},

Specifically, we build on Zander and Kogut's work [29] and examine the relationship between knowledge dimensions and knowledge sharing. Departing from their study, we focus on person-to-person, rather than organization-to-organization, knowledge sharing. We surveyed 68 employees of a Workman's Compensation Board in Canada. To analyze the data, we employed Hierarchical Linear Modeling. The results demonstrate that complexity and teachability increased person-to-person knowledge sharing but observability did not. Contrary to expectations, the availability of codified knowledge in a knowledge management system (KMS) had no impact on person-to-person knowledge transfer; individuals were as likely to share knowledge person-to-person regardless of whether there was a KMS available that contained appropriate knowledge.},

This paper studies how badge design affects people's contributions and behavior over time. Past work has shown that badges "steer'' people's behavior toward substantially increasing the amount of contributions before obtaining the badge, and immediately decreasing their contributions thereafter, returning to their baseline contribution levels. In contrast, we find that the steering effect depends on the type of user, as modeled by the rate and intensity of the user's contributions. We use these measures to distinguish between different groups of user activity, including users who are not affected by the badge system despite being significant contributors to the site. We provide a predictive model of how users change their activity group over the course of their lifetime in the system. We demonstrate our approach empirically in three different Q&amp;A sites on Stack Exchange with hundreds of thousands of users, and we discuss the implications for system designers.},

abstract = {We propose a new knowledge sharing scheme to effectively support networked cooperative works in this paper. Our scheme controls information flow from Real Space (RS) to Digital Space (DS) and reverse direction, based on the concept of "Symbiotic Computing". In practice, our scheme controls the availability of shared workspace in DS for cooperative works, according to the situation of tasks and users in RS, in order to accelerate the progress of the works. Using this scheme, advanced support to improve quality of intellectual cooperative works can be realized. In this paper, we apply our proposed scheme to a group learning domain. This is an educational activity domain where group members, including a teacher and several students cooperatively solve given problems. From experimental results, we found that the cooperative problem solving by the teacher and students were accelerated. We also confirmed that the learning outcomes were improved. Finally, we verified that our system can enhance the group learning effects by controlling the availability of the shared workspace based on the progress of the group learning process.},

Setting goals, having management commitment and informing employees about the community were not enough to develop a successful community. Therefore, an approach has been developed to identify high priority issues in six different knowledge areas. By identifying high priority issues and assigning moderators employees consider the community to be more important and therefore are prepared to participate in the community.},

Based on theoretical approaches, one model for fostering the knowledge-sharing behavior of blog students are presented in education. Our empirical study examined the influence of knowledge-sharing blog on learning outcome and learner satisfaction in e-learning environments. Three different settings were studied: two were e-learning environments—with knowledge-sharing blog, and without knowledge-sharing blog. The third was the traditional classroom environment. Results of the experiment showed that the value of sharing motivation for learning effectiveness was contingent upon the provision of knowledge-sharing. Students in the e-learning environment that provided knowledge-sharing blog achieved significantly better learning performance and a higher level of learner satisfaction than those in other settings. However, students who used the e-learning environment that provided without knowledge-sharing blog did not improve either. The findings suggest that it may be important to integrate knowledge-sharing blog into e-learning systems.},

Because expertise in an ISD project is broad and complex, this expertise is not possessed by an individual developer but distributed among team members who are selected for their expertise in the relevant domains. In addition to working cooperatively and integrating tasks, team members must exchange knowledge in order to complete the assigned project. This enormous dependence on knowledge sharing creates extensive burdens for coordination and communication on both project managers and relevant domain experts throughout all stages of the ISD project. This paper conceptualizes the benefits of a combination of vertical and shared leadership in ISD project teams, as proposed by Pearce and maps this structure to related early work on the dynamics and productivity of programming teams (most notably, Weinberg's Egoless Programming Team Structure).},

First, you get what you pay for in Q&amp;A sites. Answer quality was typically higher in Google Answers (a fee-based site) than in the free sites we studied, and paying more money for an answer led to better outcomes. Second, we find that a Q&amp;A site's community of users contributes to its success. Yahoo! Answers, a Q&amp;A site where anybody can answer questions, outperformed sites that depend on specific individuals to answer questions, such as library reference services.},

However, despite having a very engaged and active user community, Stack Overflow currently has more than 300K unanswered questions. In this paper, we perform an initial investigation to understand why these questions remain unanswered by applying a combination of statistical and data mining techniques. Our preliminary results indicate that although there are some topics that were never answered, most questions remained unanswered because they apparently are of little interest to the user community.},

abstract = {Question and Answer (Q&amp;A) services, such as Stack Overflow, rely on a community of programmers who post questions, provide and rate answers, to create what is termed "crowd knowledge". As a consequence, these services archive voluminous and potentially useful information to help developers to solve programming-specific issues. Programmers tap into this crowd knowledge through web browsers. This requires them to step out of their integrated development environments (IDE), formulate a query, inspect the returned results and manually port the solution back to the IDE. We present an integrated and largely automated approach to assist programmers who want to leverage the crowd knowledge of Q&amp;A services. We give a form to our approach by implementing Seahawk, an Eclipse plugin. Seahawk automatically formulates queries from the current context in the IDE, and presents a ranked and interactive list of results. Seahawk lets users identify individual discussion pieces and import code samples through simple drag \&amp; drop. Users can also link Stack Overflow discussions and source code persistently. We performed an evaluation of Seahawk, with promising results.},

abstract = {Stack Overflow (SO) is the most popular question-and-answer website for software developers, providing a large amount of code snippets and free-form text on a wide variety of topics. Like other software artifacts, questions and answers on SO evolve over time, for example when bugs in code snippets are fixed, code is updated to work with a more recent library version, or text surrounding a code snippet is edited for clarity. To be able to analyze how content on SO evolves, we built SOTorrent, an open dataset based on the official SO data dump. SOTorrent provides access to the version history of SO content at the level of whole posts and individual text or code blocks. It connects SO posts to other platforms by aggregating URLs from text blocks and by collecting references from GitHub files to SO posts. In this paper, we describe how we built SOTorrent, and in particular how we evaluated 134 different string similarity metrics regarding their applicability for reconstructing the version history of text and code blocks. Based on a first analysis using the dataset, we present insights into the evolution of SO posts, e.g., that post edits are usually small, happen soon after the initial creation of the post, and that code is rarely changed without also updating the surrounding text. Further, our analysis revealed a close relationship between post edits and comments. Our vision is that researchers will use SOTorrent to investigate and understand the evolution of SO posts and their relation to other platforms such as GitHub.},

Case-based reasoning (CBR) is a problem solving strategy which is based on the reuse of past solutions (cases) to address new problems. Ontologies are a means to facilitate sharing and reuse of bodies of knowledge across organizations and applications on the basis of a well-defined and precise semantics for concepts and terms. This work presents a proposal aimed at knowledge reuse, during the decision activities by means of interwoven concepts from the knowledge management, CBR and ontologies research. This blended approach presents an ontological case construction for CBR systems as theoretical and empirical support for knowledge sharing. We obtain a formal characterization of a case by means of an ontological description of particular cases, and their interrelationships with cases stored in different case-repositories. An architecture for a distributed CBR system is proposed on the basis of a multiagent setting for semantic-based access to knowledge.},

However, the contents of a Stack Overflow discussion are inherently heterogeneous, mixing natural language, source code, stack traces and configuration files in XML or JSON format.We constructed a full island grammar capable of modeling the set of 700,000 Stack Overflow discussions talking about Java, building a heterogeneous abstract syntax tree (H-AST) of each post (question, answer or comment) in a discussion. The resulting dataset models every Stack Overflow discussion, providing a full H-AST for each type of structured fragment (i.e., JSON, XML, Java, Stack traces), and complementing this information with a set of basic meta-information like term frequency to enable natural language analyses. Our dataset allows the end-user to perform combined analyses of the Stack Overflow by visiting the H-AST of a discussion.},

In most existing research, question-code pairs were collected heuristically and tend to have low quality. In this paper, we investigate a new problem of systematically mining question-code pairs from Stack Overflow (in contrast to heuristically collecting them). It is formulated as predicting whether or not a code snippet is a standalone solution to a question. We propose a novel Bi-View Hierarchical Neural Network which can capture both the programming content and the textual context of a code snippet (i.e., two views) to make a prediction. On two manually annotated datasets in Python and SQL domain, our framework substantially outperforms heuristic methods with at least 15\% higher F1 and accuracy. Furthermore, we present StaQC (Stack Overflow Question-Code pairs), the largest dataset to date of ~148K Python and ~120K SQL question-code pairs, automatically mined from SO using our framework. Under various case studies, we demonstrate that StaQC can greatly help develop data-hungry models for associating natural language with programming language},

abstract = {The work presented in this paper is intended to test crucial system services against stack overflow vulnerabilities. The focus of the test is the user-accessible variables, that is to say, the inputs from the user as specified at the command line or in a configuration file. The tester is defined as a process for automatically generating a wide variety of user-accessible variables that result in malicious buffers (an exploit). In this work, the search for successful exploits is formulated as an optimization problem and solved using evolutionary computation. Moreover the resulting attacks are passed through the Snort misuse detection system to observe the detection (or not) of each exploit.},

abstract = {The management of knowledge in software processes is becoming a challenging concern for researchers and practitioners. Explicit knowledge can be formalized in many kinds of documents and rules, and consequently transferred in a number of manners. On the contrary, tacit knowledge cannot be formalized, because it is mainly retained in personal cognitive models and consists of individual capabilities of dealing with problems. The design of software systems requires a consistent deployment of tacit knowledge, and pair programming has shown great promises for helping to share knowledge between programmers. It is a common experience that programmers come not only from computer science and engineering curricula, but also from other education degrees, such as mathematics, natural sciences, and social sciences. In this case they attend proper specialist post graduation courses. We have executed an experiment in order to verify the relationship between educational background of pair’s components and knowledge sharing throughout working in pairs while designing software systems.},

Knowledge extraction often relies on meta data. This meta data can either be harvested from user-provided tags, or inferred by algorithms from the respective data. The question arises to which extent either type of meta data can be trusted and relied upon.We study this problem in the context of language identification of code snippets posted on Stack Overflow. We analyse the consistency between user-provided tags and the classification obtained with GitHub linguist, an industry-strength automated language recognition tool. We find that the results obtained by both approaches are often not consistent. This indicates that both have to be used with great care. Our results also suggest that developers may not follow the evolutionary path of programming languages beyond one step when seeking or providing answers to software engineering challenges encountered.},

abstract = {Background Software developers are increasingly required to write concurrent code. However, most developers find concurrent programming difficult. To better help developers, it is imperative to understand their interest and difficulties in terms of concurrency topics they encounter often when writing concurrent code.Aims In this work, we conduct a large-scale study on the textual content of the entirety of Stack Overflow to understand the interests and difficulties of concurrency developers.Method First, we develop a set of concurrency tags to extract concurrency questions that developers ask. Second, we use latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) topic modeling and an open card sort to manually determine the topics of these questions. Third, we construct a topic hierarchy by repeated grouping of similar topics into categories and lower level categories into higher level categories. Fourth, we investigate the coincidence of our concurrency topics with findings of previous work. Fifth, we measure the popularity and difficulty of our concurrency topics and analyze their correlation. Finally, we discuss the implications of our findings.Results A few findings of our study are the following. (1) Developers ask questions about a broad spectrum of concurrency topics ranging from multithreading to parallel computing, mobile concurrency to web concurrency and memory consistency to run-time speedup. (2) These questions can be grouped into a hierarchy with eight major categories: concurrency models, programming paradigms, correctness, debugging, basic concepts, persistence, performance and GUI. (3) Developers ask more about correctness of their concurrent programs than performance. (4) Concurrency questions about thread safety and database management systems are among the most popular and the most difficult, respectively. (5) Difficulty and popularity of concurrency topics are negatively correlated.Conclusions The results of our study can not only help concurrency developers but also concurrency educators and researchers to better decide where to focus their efforts, by trading off one concurrency topic against another.},

A model of knowledge management and knowledge sharing was developed inspired by the work of Nahapiet and Ghoshal. Data on demographics and various social capital measures were collected from a sample of members of a tertiary educational institution in Singapore in 2003. Reward \&amp; recognition, open-mindedness and cost concerns of knowledge hoarding turned out to be the strongest predictors of knowledge sharing rather than pro-social motives or organizational concern. Overall, the findings provide evidence for the importance of a conducive organizational climate and state-of-the art performance management systems in high-performing knowledge organizations.},

abstract = {Stack Overflow (SO) is the largest Q&amp;A website for developers, providing a huge amount of copyable code snippets. Using these snippets raises various maintenance and legal issues. The SO license requires attribution, i.e., referencing the original question or answer, and requires derived work to adopt a compatible license. While there is a heated debate on SO's license model for code snippets and the required attribution, little is known about the extent to which snippets are copied from SO without proper attribution. In this paper, we present the research design and summarized results of an empirical study analyzing attributed and unattributed usages of SO code snippets in GitHub projects. On average, 3.22\% of all analyzed repositories and 7.33\% of the popular ones contained a reference to SO. Further, we found that developers rather refer to the whole thread on SO than to a specific answer. For Java, at least two thirds of the copied snippets were not attributed.},

abstract = {Sequential algorithm portfolios for satisfiability testing SAT, such as &lt;Emphasis FontCategory="NonProportional"&gt;SATzilla&lt;/Emphasis&gt; and &lt;Emphasis FontCategory="NonProportional"&gt;3S&lt;/Emphasis&gt;, have enjoyed much success in the last decade. By leveraging the differing strengths of individual SAT solvers, portfolios employing older solvers have often fared as well or better than newly designed ones, in several categories of the annual SAT Competitions and Races. We propose two simple yet powerful techniques to further boost the performance of sequential portfolios, namely, a generic way of knowledge sharing suitable for sequential SAT solver schedules which is commonly employed in parallel SAT solvers, and a meta-level guardian classifier for judging whether to switch the main solver suggested by the portfolio with a recourse action solver. With these additions, we show that the performance of the sequential portfolio solver &lt;Emphasis FontCategory="NonProportional"&gt;3S&lt;/Emphasis&gt;, which dominated other sequential categories but was ranked 10th in the application category of the 2011 SAT Competition, can be boosted significantly, bringing it just one instance short of matching the performance of the winning application track solver, while still outperforming all other solvers submitted to the crafted and random categories.},

We apply item-based similarity computation in a CF framework to retrieve N information objects based on the user's interests and recommended by peer. The N information objects are then subjected to a CBR based compositional adaptation method to further select relevant information objects from the N retrieved past cases in order to generate a more fine-grained recommendation.},

abstract = {Despite the apparent benefits of modern social coding paradigm such as Stack Overflow, its potential security risks have been largely overlooked (e.g., insecure codes could be easily embedded and distributed). To address this imminent issue, in this paper, we bring a significant insight to leverage both social coding properties and code content for automatic detection of insecure code snippets in Stack Overflow. To determine if the given code snippets are insecure, we not only analyze the code content, but also utilize various kinds of relations among users, badges, questions, answers and code snippets in Stack Overflow. To model the rich semantic relationships, we first introduce a structured heterogeneous information network (HIN) for representation and then use meta-path based approach to incorporate higher-level semantics to build up relatedness over code snippets. Later, we propose a novel hierarchical attention-based sequence learning model named CodeHin2Vec to seamlessly integrate node (i.e., code snippet) content with HIN-based relations for representation learning. After that, a classifier is built for insecure code snippet detection. Integrating our proposed method, an intelligent system named iTrustSO is accordingly developed to address the code security issues in modern software coding platforms. Comprehensive experiments on the data collections from Stack Overflow are conducted to validate the effectiveness of our developed system iTrustSO by comparisons with alternative methods.},

Hence this study will use the same theory to understand individual’s knowledge sharing behavior and specifically how extrinsic rewards can affect knowledge sharing attitude. Hence the objective of this study is to propose a framework of individual’s knowledge sharing attitude by using literature from different sources. The study will also propose five hypotheses based on the proposed framework. The study will examine (1) the effect of extrinsic rewards on knowledge sharing attitude (2) How demographic variables effect the relationship between extrinsic rewards and knowledge sharing attitude? (3) What is the effect of OCBs on the effect of extrinsic rewards on knowledge sharing attitude?(4) What is the impact of employee’s knowledge sharing attitude on his/her intention towards knowledge sharing? And (5) what is the impact of employee’s knowledge sharing intention on his knowledge sharing behavior? This will help us to understand how extrinsic motivation influence an individual’s knowledge sharing attitude and how his intrinsic attributes strengthen or weaken this relationship.},

abstract = {Together with the development of Web 2.0 technology, we need to focus more on large-scale knowledge sharing. Owing to the characteristics of the long-tail distribution generally observed in conventional knowledge-sharing systems, knowledge providers are sometimes unwilling to share knowledge when they are unable to obtain any feedback. However, when knowledge acquirers read long-tail knowledge, they may easily feel bored because such knowledge rarely matches their own interests. To solve these problems, we proposed and implemented a gamified knowledge-sharing system called "Light Quest," which can share long-tail knowledge in an entertaining way. In this system, the users can briefly describe knowledge they would like to share using a "Tips Card," and evaluate the cards written by other users, by choosing the best card from a set of cards that are randomly selected from a knowledge pool. The results of a four-week experimental evaluation indicated that the system could increase users' motivation to both provide and acquire knowledge.},

On one hand, moderation is of crucial importance in maintaining the content quality indispensable for the future sustainability of the site. On the other hand, details about the closing reason might frequently appear blurred to the user, which leads to debates and occasional negative behavior in answers or comments. With the aim of helping the users compose good quality questions, we introduce a set of classifiers for the categorization of Stack Overflow posts prior to their actual submission. Our binary classifier is capable of predicting whether a question will be closed after posting with an accuracy of 71.87\%. Additionally, in this study we propose the first multiclass classifier to estimate the exact reason of closing a question to an accuracy of 48.55\%. Both classifiers are based on Gated Recurrent Units and trained solely on the pre-submission textual information of Stack Overflow posts.},

abstract = {This paper presents the knowledge sharing model that interconnects knowledge management enablers and the sharing process of tacit knowledge in a public sector accounting organisation. This empirical study of knowledge sharing model in an accounting organisation is another knowledge management breakthrough whereby sharing process of tacit knowledge can be used as a strategic knowledge management process to support the knowledge flow and knowledge networks to improve accounting process, reporting structure and decision making process. This conceptual relationship model which integrates knowledge management solution through learning, leadership, culture and technology to improve knowledge sharing process, was empirically tested via survey questionnaires among all public sector accountants who are employed by the Accountant General’s Department of Malaysia. Through factor analysis and multiple regression analysis, the statistical results of this study indicated that performance evaluation and incentives has a high significant impact on the sharing performance of tacit knowledge as compared to the moderate significant factors of leadership roles in knowledge sharing culture and knowledge sharing technology.},

abstract = {The purpose of this study is to implement a webbased bookmark (WBB) tool with ontological approach for knowledge sharing of special interest groups (SIG). People at across levels are staggered by the findings and conclusions of thousands of other papers. Yet specialization becomes increasingly necessary for progress, and the effort to bridge between members among a SIG is correspondingly superficial. The ontological approach in this study provides domain-oriented vocabularies for recomendation of the new information to be allocated. The methodology is based on development of RDF/RDFS and application of the Jena API. The contribution of this study has two facets: (a). It extends the bookmark tool into web-based for knowledge sharing; (b). It consists of intelligent algorithm in terms of recommendations of new information allocation by matching the existing domain ontology. Finally, the implications of this study are also included.},

abstract = {As modern social coding platforms such as GitHub and Stack Overflow become increasingly popular, their potential security risks increase as well (e.g., risky or malicious codes could be easily embedded and distributed). To enhance the social coding security, in this paper, we propose to automate cross-platform user identification between GitHub and Stack Overflow to combat the attackers who attempt to poison the modern software programming ecosystem. To solve this problem, an important insight brought by this work is to leverage social coding properties in addition to user attributes for cross-platform user identification. To depict users in GitHub and Stack Overflow (attached with attributed information), projects, questions and answers as well as the rich semantic relations among them, we first introduce an attributed heterogeneous information network (AHIN) for modeling. Then, we propose a novel AHIN representation learning model AHIN2Vec to efficiently learn node (i.e., user) representations in AHIN for cross-platform user identification. Comprehensive experiments on the data collections from GitHub and Stack Overflow are conducted to validate the effectiveness of our developed system iDev integrating our proposed method in cross-platform user identification by comparisons with other baselines.},

In this paper, we propose a method to support learners in the information seeking process which consists in answering their questions by retrieving question paraphrases and their corresponding answers from social Q&amp;A sites. Given the novelty of this kind of data, it is crucial to get a better understanding of how questions in social Q&amp;A sites can be automatically analysed and retrieved. We discuss and evaluate several pre-processing strategies and question similarity metrics, using a new question paraphrase corpus collected from the WikiAnswers Q&amp;A site. The results show that viable performance levels of more than 80\% accuracy can be obtained for the task of question paraphrase retrieval.},

This empirical study examines the effect of national culture and in-group/out-group relationship on knowledge sharing attitude. A set of questionnaires measuring cultural values, and scenarios engendering different types of relationships among group members were conducted with students from China, United States, Kingdom of Bahrain and from the Kingdom of Thailand. The results show some cultural differences in term of knowledge sharing intensity and preferences. This suggests that global organizations should manage their knowledge sharing environment and strategy in different ways in different parts of the world if they want to maximize its benefits. There is a direct implication of this research on the usage of knowledge management technologies, since for instance, the participation in online communities of practices for employees of multinational corporations is directly affected by cultural values.},

To bring the best value out of these knowledge repositories, it is critically important for CQA services to know how to find the right experts, retrieve archived similar questions and recommend best answers to new questions. To tackle this cluster of closely related problems in a principled approach, we proposed Topic Expertise Model (TEM), a novel probabilistic generative model with GMM hybrid, to jointly model topics and expertise by integrating textual content model and link structure analysis. Based on TEM results, we proposed CQARank to measure user interests and expertise score under different topics. Leveraging the question answering history based on long-term community reviews and voting, our method could find experts with both similar topical preference and high topical expertise. Experiments carried out on Stack Overflow data, the largest CQA focused on computer programming, show that our method achieves significant improvement over existing methods on multiple metrics.},

abstract = {Community Question Answering (CQA) services have become popular methods to seek and share information. In CQA, users with an information need, or askers, post a question that community members can answer. This question-answering process allows both askers and answerers to learn through the exchange of information. CQA services have also been widely used in the education domain, as some of such services are designed specifically for students' information seeking. However, due to insufficient knowledge, lack of experience, and other reasons, students often struggle in producing quality or even appropriate content. This low quality production causes their content to be flagged or deleted, further discouraging them from participating in the CQA process and instigating a vicious cycle of bad users and bad content. In an effort to break this cycle, the work reported here focuses on identifying users whose postings demonstrate a high deletion rate with a presumption that the bad content is an indication of a struggling student rather than a malicious user. In this work, experiments are conducted on a large student-oriented online CQA community to understand struggling students' behaviors. A framework is proposed to find these users based solely on their activities. Finally, community feedback (i.e. human judgment) such as moderator evaluation or community votes for good content is used to detect these users in the early stages of their respective struggles. To evaluate this framework, we used data from Brainly, a large educational CQA service that is used in two different markets with more than 3.7 million users and 10.7 million answers. The results show that the human judgment feature identifies early-stage struggling users with high accuracy. Identifying these struggling users (students) could help educators to determine suitable ways to help their students instead of presuming them to be bad users and cutting them off from the community.},

This problem can be alleviated via virtual online communities that allow educators to support each other and share knowledge and teaching materials. Virtual communities experience varying levels of success or failure, and it is often not easy to determine the causes for these differences. Factors include social and technical aspects, and it is typically not trivial to attribute community behaviour clearly to one or the other. In this paper we describe the "ColourRoom" software, a web-based platform to support virtual communities of educators. This software has been deployed to three distinct communities -- educators using BlueJ, educators using Greenfoot, and UK computer science school teachers (regardless of software) -- which affords a rare opportunity to analyse the usage of the same software in different communities, providing insights into both the communities and the design of software to support them.},

Software engineering knowledge, embodied in textual documentations, bug reports and online forum discussions, is expressed in natural language, but is full of domain terms, software entities and software-specific informal languages. Such software texts call for software-specific POS tagging. In the software engineering community, there have been several attempts leveraging POS tagging technique to help solve software engineering tasks. However, little work is done for POS tagging on software natural language texts.In this paper, we build a software-specific POS tagger, called S-POS, for processing the textual discussions on Stack Overflow. We target at Stack Overflow because it has become an important developer-generated knowledge repository for software engineering. We define a POS tagset that is suitable for describing software engineering knowledge, select corpus, develop a custom tokenizer, annotate data, design features for supervised model training, and demonstrate that the tagging accuracy of S-POS outperforms that of the Stanford POS Tagger when tagging software texts. Our work presents a feasible roadmap to build software-specific POS tagger for the socio-professional contents on Stack Overflow, and reveals challenges and opportunities for advanced software-specific information extraction.},

Indeed, existing similar systems facilitate collaboration at the risk to convey doubtful information and sometimes serve as a gate to vandalism. Our system called “WiseShare” ensures collaboration while focusing on the reliability of the broadcasted content. To achieve this goal, we precisely express the requirements needed to control the shared information. In addition, we define a formal framework for specifying security policies governing contributions requests according to user profile. We present also a prototype implementing the functionalities of our system. In our approach, a new user has limited rights. On an ongoing basis, if he demonstrates his ability to produce good contributions, he gains new privileges. Conversely, if he often generates contributions with a questionable content, he loses the held privileges. Therefore, granting user requests depends closely on his previous behavior (the history). Indeed, our system encourages users to adopt a responsible attitude by focusing on the reliability of the content of their contributions instead of their frequency. Consequently, WiseShare permits to significantly minimize clumsy and malicious actions.},

Python and JavaScript proved to be the languages for which the most code snippets are usable. Conversely, Java and C# proved to be the languages with the lowest usability rate. Further qualitative analysis on usable Python snippets shows the characteristics of the answers that solve the original question. Finally, we use Google search to investigate the alignment of usability and the natural language annotations around code snippets, and explore how to make snippets in Stack Overflow an adequate base for future automatic program generation.},

It is important to understand what influence employees contribute to knowledge sharing. Using survey responses from 173 employees of a large US university, we found that employees' creative contributions to an electronic knowledge sharing database (EKSDB) are directly influenced by their levels of affective commitment, perceptions of creative contributions as an in-role behavior, and perceptions of technological adequacy. Top management openness affects employee contribution indirectly through employee affective commitment and perception of creative contributions as an in-role behavior. In addition, the effects of employee affective commitment and perceptions of creative contribution as an in-role behavior on employee contribution are moderated by employee job security. By including intrinsic, extrinsic, and contextual variables, this model improves upon previous representations of factors leading employees' to make creative contributions to an EKSDB.},

This paper presents an empirical study on the prevalence and severity of API misuse on Stack Overflow. To reduce manual assessment effort, we design ExampleCheck, an API usage mining framework that extracts patterns from over 380K Java repositories on GitHub and subsequently reports potential API usage violations in Stack Overflow posts. We analyze 217,818 Stack Overflow posts using ExampleCheck and find that 31\% may have potential API usage violations that could produce unexpected behavior such as program crashes and resource leaks. Such API misuse is caused by three main reasons---missing control constructs, missing or incorrect order of API calls, and incorrect guard conditions. Even the posts that are accepted as correct answers or upvoted by other programmers are not necessarily more reliable than other posts in terms of API misuse. This study result calls for a new approach to augment Stack Overflow with alternative API usage details that are not typically shown in curated examples.},

abstract = {As the popularity of modern social coding paradigm such as Stack Overflow grows, its potential security risks increase as well (e.g., insecure codes could be easily embedded and distributed). To address this largely overlooked issue, in this paper, we bring an important new insight to exploit social coding properties in addition to code content for automatic detection of insecure code snippets in Stack Overflow. To determine if the given code snippets are insecure, we not only analyze the code content, but also utilize various kinds of relations among users, badges, questions, answers, code snippets and keywords in Stack Overflow. To model the rich semantic relationships, we first introduce a structured heterogeneous information network (HIN) for representation and then use meta-path based approach to incorporate higher-level semantics to build up relatedness over code snippets. Later, we propose a novel network embedding model named snippet2vec for representation learning in HIN where both the HIN structures and semantics are maximally preserved. After that, a multi-view fusion classifier is constructed for insecure code snippet detection. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work utilizing both code content and social coding properties to address the code security issues in modern software coding platforms. Comprehensive experiments on the data collections from Stack Overflow are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the developed system ICSD which integrates our proposed method in insecure code snippet detection by comparisons with alternative approaches.},

abstract = {Knowledge Management (KM) has become a key success factor in diverse fields, given the importance of knowledge as a significant organizational asset. In order to solve problems and support complex decision-making processes, knowledge and experience have to be transmitted across individuals, business units and organizations. Thus, Knowledge Sharing (KS) can be considered as the basic element of any knowledge-oriented process: KS fosters collaboration in complex environments, and facilitates experiential knowledge discovery, distribution and use. This paper presents a proposal for the development of a Community of Practice (CoP) called the E-Decisional Community. This community uses a domain-independent knowledge representation called Set of Experience Knowledge Structure (SOEKS), and captures the decisional fingerprint inside organizations using Decisional DNA. It is based on principles from different technologies namely Software Agents, Grid and Cloud computing, in order to provide an autonomous, intelligent and coordinated large-scale KS environment. The E-Decisional Community biggest concern is to promote experiential knowledge evolution and sharing through generations of decision-makers, aiming at the creation of a marketplace where knowledge is provided as a service.},

abstract = {Stack Overflow (SO) is a question and answers (Q&amp;A) web platform on software development that is gaining in popularity. With increasing popularity often comes a very unwelcome side effect: A decrease in the average quality of a post. To keep Q&amp;A websites like SO useful it is vital that this side effect is countered. Previous research proved to be reasonably successful in using properties of questions to help identify low quality questions to be later reviewed and improved.We present an approach to improve the classification of high and low quality questions based on a novel source of information: the analysis of the code fragments in SO questions. We show that we get similar performance to classification based on a wider set of metrics thus potentially reaching a better overall classification.},

abstract = {Stack Overflow has been providing question and answering service for 7 years. It has become a tremendous knowledge repository for developers' thoughts and practices. Hyperlinks in discussion threads of Stack Overflow are essential knowledge entities for programming on the Web, such as a software library, an API documentation, a code example, or a tutorial. Tens of millions of hyperlinks are disseminated in Stack Overflow, while wisdom on what web resources have been highly recognized by the community is implicit in millions of discussion threads. In this paper, we develop the WisLinker framework that extracts knowledge from discussion, then turns knowledge into wisdom by learning through the knowledge dissemination history. With this wisdom, for a specific hyperlink that users are concerned with, WisLinker can recommend web resources highly recognized by the Stack Overflow community. We evaluate the validity of WisLinker in an open-ended setting using Stack Overflow data dump. We also implement a browser extension for live recommendation of web resources while users browse web pages. WisLinker could enable more efficient exploratory search and information discovery of programming-related web resources.},

abstract = {The primary purpose of the study was to construct Knowledge Sharing (KS) Platform. In addition, the attitude and perception about knowledge sharing of teachers who participate in the quasi-experimental study was explored. For accuracy of the research results, the researchers adopted several research methods including literature review, Modified Delphi Technique, quasi-experiment study and survey, when examining the research issue.The subjects for this study were two teachers from two classes of Department of Electrical Machinery in a vocational high school in Kaohsiung city, Taiwan, R.O.C. In order to conduct the survey of Modified Delphi Technique, a total of 10 questionnaires were mailed out to experts in a purposeful sampling. Based upon the result of the Modified Delphi survey, the KS platform was constructed. Then, teachers evaluated Self-evaluation Questionnaire of applying KS platform. The Cronbach alpha coefficient of the Self-evaluation Questionnaire was 0.94, suggesting the internal reliability to be quite acceptable. Thus, Data collected through the above two questionnaires was analyzed by Frequency, Mean, and Chi-square.The result of the research was as follows: By the statistic results of the Modified Delphi survey, the mean above 3 which could be regard as needed to construct the KS Platform have the following ten items: "lecture courses", "team teaching", "teachers research association", "courses development committee", "department meeting", "Q&amp;A", "teaching achievement exhibition", "communities of practice", "on-line information exchange", "study club", "chatting" and "diary". As to the above opinion, the 10 experts reached convergence. Based upon the above result of the Modified Delphi survey, the issues of "discussion board" "related linked websites", "search engine", "teaching database" and "electric newspaper" were constructed in the KS platform.After the analysis of the Self--evaluation Questionnaire, we found that two teachers of experimental group had positive attitude to knowledge sharing. This indicated that teachers were willing to implement the KS platform as an instructional tool. Finally, the conclusion was proposed.},

Although these sites provide opportunities for users to seek for help or provide answers, they also bring new challenges. One of the challenges is most new questions posted everyday cannot be routed to the appropriate users who can answer them in CQA. That is to say, experts cannot receive questions that match their expertise. Therefore new questions cannot be answered in time. In this paper, we propose an approach which based on distributed representations of words to predict the best answerer for a new question on CQA sites. Our approach considers both user activity and user authority. The user activity and user authority are based on the previous questions answered by the user. We have applied our model on the dataset downloaded from StackOverflow, one of the biggest CQA sites. The results show that our approach performs better than the TF-IDF and Language Model based methods.},

abstract = {Community-driven Question Answering (Q&amp;A) platforms are gaining popularity now-a-days and the number of posts on such platforms are increasing tremendously. Thus, the challenge to keep these platforms noise-free is attracting the interest of research community. Stack Overflow is one such popular computer programming related Q&amp;A platform. The established users on Stack Overflow have learnt the acceptable format and scope of questions in due course. Even if their questions get closed, they are aware of the required edits, therefore the chances of their questions being reopened increases. On the other hand, non-established users have not adapted to the Stack Overflow system and find difficulty in editing their closed questions. In this work, we aim to identify features which help differentiate editing approaches of established and non-established users, and motivate the need of recommendation model. Such a recommendation model can assist every user to edit their closed questions leveraging the edit-style of the established users of the platform.},

abstract = {Question and Answer (Q&amp;A) sites help developers dealing with the increasing complexity of software systems and third-party components by providing a platform for exchanging knowledge about programming topics. A shortcoming of Q&amp;A sites is that they provide no indication on when an answer is to be expected. Such an indication would help, for example, the developers who posed the questions in managing their time. We try to fill this gap by investigating whether and how answering time for a question posed on Stack Overflow, a prominent example of Q&amp;A websites, can be predicted considering its tags. To this aim, we first determine the types of answers to be considered valid answers to the question, after which the answering time was predicted based on similarity of the set of tags. Our results show that the classification is correct in 30\%-35\% of the cases.},

It is essential to embody a knowledge-sharing climate and interdisciplinary knowledge integration, both of which are critical to facilitating innovation. By drawing upon social capital theory, this study presents a knowledge sharing climate. This study also shows how interdisciplinary knowledge integration mediates between functional diversity and innovation and between a knowledge-sharing climate and innovation. Data collected from 202 individuals from interdisciplinary project teams were used to test the research model. Empirical results indicate that innovation is significantly affected by interdisciplinary knowledge integration and openness. Functional diversity and trusting relationships do not have direct impacts on innovation but are mediated by interdisciplinary knowledge integration. The findings have critical theoretical and practical implications which are discussed in the paper.},

The game rules and system architecture should be simple but should capture the true SCM nature. For this purpose, our developed SCM game applies an unbalanced social networking service system platform. In contrast to previous business games, the game is accessible through mobile devices such as smart phones. The new SCM game was tested at two universities, and most of the students spontaneously grasped the bullwhip effect and the importance of knowledge sharing between SC organizations. Furthermore, their realization of various difficulties in a SC exceeded our expectations. In addition to offering educational benefits, our game could become an important tool in future SC research.},

abstract = {The functionality of an information kiosk can be extended by allowing it to interact with a smartphone, as demonstrated by the Kimono system, and the user interface can be greatly simplified by "associations" between pieces of information. A kiosk provides information that is relevant to a particular location and can use valuable context information, such as the fact that a user is physically standing in front of the kiosk, to tailor the display. Its graphically rich screen is suitable for presenting information to the user and has a natural input modality requiring the user to simply touch the screen. However, a kiosk lacks mobility and cannot stay with the user as he or she moves about the environment. Also, information provided by the kiosk must be remembered by the user. Finally, it is difficult to add information to the kiosk, and so the kiosk remains an information display device.All this changes when a handset, such as a PDA or smart-phone, can interact with the kiosk. The handset acts like a personalized proxy of the kiosk. It accompanies the user serving as a memory device. It is also an excellent media creation device, capable of taking pictures and recording voice memos as well as short text messages. Associating newly created content with other currently selected content makes for a simpler user interface. Content and its associations can be uploaded to a kiosk allowing others to access to it.},

This paper presents CodeK\={o}an, a scalable engine for searching millions of online code examples written by the worldwide programmers' community which uses data parallel processing to achieve horizontal scalability. The search engine relies on a token-based, programming language independent algorithm and, as a proof-of-concept, indexes all code examples from Stack Overflow for two programming languages: Java and Python. This paper demonstrates the benefits of extracting crowd knowledge from Stack Overflow by analyzing well-known open source repositories such as OpenNLP and Elasticsearch: Up to one third of the source code in the examined repositories reuses code patterns from Stack Overflow. It also shows that the proposed approach recognizes similar source code and is resilient to modifications such as insertion, deletion and swapping of statements. Furthermore, evidence is given that the proposed approach returns very few false positives among the search results.},

abstract = {The Stack Overflow web site is an online community where programmers can ask and answer one another's questions, earning points and badges. The site offers guidance in the form of a Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ), beginning with "What kind of questions can I ask here?" The answer explains that "the best Stack Overflow questions have a bit of source code in them". This paper explores the role of source code and non-source code text on Stack Overflow in both questions and answers. The primary contribution of this paper is to provide a more detailed understanding of whether the presence of source code (and how much) actually will produce the "best" Stack Overflow questions or answers. A second contribution of this paper is to determine how the non-code portions of the text might also contribute the "best" Stack Overflow postings.},

abstract = {One of the many effects of social media in software development is the flourishing of very large communities of practice where members share a common interest, such as programming languages, frameworks, and tools. These communities of practice use many different communication channels but little is known about how these communities create, share, and curate knowledge using such channels. In this paper, we report a qualitative study of how one community of practice---the R software development community---creates and curates knowledge associated with questions and answers (Q&amp;A) in two of its main communication channels: the R-tag in Stack Overflow and the R-users mailing list. The results reveal that knowledge is created and curated in two main forms: participatory, where multiple members explicitly collaborate to build knowledge, and crowdsourced, where individuals work independently of each other. The contribution of this paper is a characterization of knowledge types that are exchanged by these communities of practice, including a description of the reasons why members choose one channel over the other. Finally, this paper enumerates a set of recommendations to assist practitioners in the use of multiple channels for Q&amp;A.},

abstract = {This paper investigates how developers discuss code smells and anti-patterns over Stack Overflow to understand better their perceptions and understanding of these two concepts. Understanding developers' perceptions of these issues are important in order to inform and align future research efforts and direct tools vendors in the area of code smells and anti-patterns. In addition, such insights could lead the creation of solutions to code smells and anti-patterns that are better fit to the realities developers face in practice. We applied both quantitative and qualitative techniques to analyse discussions containing terms associated with code smells and anti-patterns. Our findings show that developers widely use Stack Overflow to ask for general assessments of code smells or anti-patterns, instead of asking for particular refactoring solutions. An interesting finding is that developers very often ask their peers 'to smell their code' (i.e., ask whether their own code 'smells' or not), and thus, utilize Stack Overflow as an informal, crowd-based code smell/anti-pattern detector. We conjecture that the crowd-based detection approach considers contextual factors, and thus, tends to be more trusted by developers over automated detection tools. We also found that developers often discuss the downsides of implementing specific design patterns, and 'flag' them as potential anti-patterns to be avoided. Conversely, we found discussions on why some anti-patterns previously considered harmful should not be flagged as anti-patterns. Our results suggest that there is a need for: 1) more context-based evaluations of code smells and anti-patterns, and 2) better guidelines for making trade-offs when applying design patterns or eliminating smells/anti-patterns in industry.},

abstract = {The information that is made available through the semantic web will be accessed through complex programs (web-services, sensors, etc.) that may interact in sophisticated ways. Composition guided simply by the specifications of programs' inputs and outputs is insufficient to obtain reliable aggregate performance - hence the recognised need for process models to specify the interactions required between programs. These interaction models, however, are traditionally viewed as a consequence of service composition rather than as the focal point for facilitating composition. We describe an operational system that uses models of interaction as the focus for knowledge exchange. Our implementation adopts a peer to peer architecture, thus making minimal assumptions about centralisation of knowledge sources, discovery and interaction control.},

abstract = {Stack Overflow is widely regarded as the most popular Community driven Question Answering (CQA) website for programmers. Questions posted on Stack Overflow which are not related to programming topics, are marked as `closed' by experienced users and community moderators. A question can be `closed' for five reasons -- duplicate, off-topic, subjective, not a real question and too localized. In this work, we present the first study of `closed' questions on Stack Overflow. We download 4 years of publicly available data which contains 3.4 Million questions. We first analyze and characterize the complete set of 0.1 Million `closed' questions. Next, we use a machine learning framework and build a predictive model to identify a `closed' question at the time of question creation.One of our key findings is that despite being marked as `closed', subjective questions contain high information value and are very popular with the users. We observe an increasing trend in the percentage of closed questions over time and find that this increase is positively correlated to the number of newly registered users. In addition, we also see a decrease in community participation to mark a `closed' question which has led to an increase in moderation job time. We also find that questions closed with the Duplicate and Off Topic labels are relatively more prone to reputation gaming. Our analysis suggests broader implications for content quality maintenance on CQA websites. For the `closed' question prediction task, we make use of multiple genres of feature sets based on - user profile, community process, textual style and question content. We use a state-of-art machine learning classifier based on an ensemble framework and achieve an overall accuracy of 70.3\%. Analysis of the feature space reveals that `closed' questions are relatively less informative and descriptive than non-`closed' questions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first experimental study to analyze and predict `closed' questions on Stack Overflow.},

abstract = {The tutorial first addresses requirements and semantic problems to integrate digital information into large scale, meaningful networks of knowledge that support not only access to source documents but also use and reuse of integrated information. The pros and cons of developing global ontologies are discussed. It is argued that core ontologies of relationships are fundamental to schema integration and play a completely different role to that of specialist terminologies in practical knowledge management. The CIDOC Conceptual Reference Model (CRM) is presented as an example of such a global model. It is a core ontology and new ISO standard (ISO 21127, accepted September 2006), originally designed for the semantic integration of information from museums, libraries, and archives. It is a product of re-engineering the dominant underlying common concepts from representative data structures. It is not prescriptive, but provides a controlled language to describe common high-level semantics that allow for information integration at the schema level. The tutorial addresses part of the technology needed for information aggregation and integration in the global information environment, namely the question to which extent and in which form global schema integration is feasible. The ability of the CRM to support integration has been demonstrated in a large range of different domains including cultural heritage, e-science and biodiversity. Conceptual modeling by specializing such a well-tested core ontology not only reduces drastically development time and improves system quality, but provides basic semantic interoperability more or less for free. The tutorial will present characteristic applications.},

Students were engaged as active co-designers in the system, examining existing applications online offering similar services, discussing relevant research in building online communities, and ultimately re-designing the system to make it context-appropriate for different deployment scenarios. This paper reports on the details of this unique design process, discussing its merits, implications, and the prototypes that resulted. The paper concludes with a discussion of the peer design process as an instructional approach that promotes student engagement.},

abstract = {Due to the widespread use of information technologies, call centers for technical support are increasingly demanded and often overloaded. Interactive online help systems are considered to be a fruitful supplement to traditional support systems. The paper at hand proposes a conceptual frame for this alternative, based on knowledge sharing in communities of practice (CoPs). A literature review is done bringing together theoretical issues and recent research from the fields of CoPs and academic help seeking. Both approaches are well represented in the empirical research literature. While they are complementary, hence compatible to each other, their combination is not yet sufficiently explored from the psychological and educational point of view. To explore and foster help-seeking in CoPs, we developed a help system based on active participation and knowledge sharing between CoP members. The empirical part of this paper presents the evaluation of the help system, which is based on acceptance theories. The evaluation results are encouraging, and suggest possibilities of further development of the help system in the CoP context, as well as means to foster CoPs and support knowledge sharing.},

abstract = {Stack Overflow is the most popular Community based Question Answering (CQA) website for programmers on the web with 2.05M users, 5.1M questions and 9.4M answers. Stack Overflow has explicit, detailed guidelines on how to post questions and an ebullient moderation community. Despite these precise communications and safeguards, questions posted on Stack Overflow can be extremely off topic or very poor in quality. Such questions can be deleted from Stack Overflow at the discretion of experienced community members and moderators. We present the first study of deleted questions on Stack Overflow. We divide our study into two parts - (i) Characterization of deleted questions over ~5 years (2008-2013) of data, (ii) Prediction of deletion at the time of question creation. Our characterization study reveals multiple insights on question deletion phenomena. We find that it takes substantial time to vote a question to be deleted but once voted, the community takes swift action. We also see that question authors delete their questions to salvage reputation points. We notice some instances of accidental deletion of good quality questions but such questions are voted back to be undeleted quickly. We discover a pyramidal structure of question quality on Stack Overflow and find that deleted questions lie at the bottom (lowest quality) of the pyramid. We also build a predictive model to detect the deletion of question at the creation time. We experiment with 47 features -- based on User Profile, Community Generated, Question Content and Syntactic style -- and report an accuracy of 66\%. Our findings reveal important suggestions for content quality maintenance on community based question answering websites. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first large scale study on poor quality (deleted) questions on Stack Overflow.},

abstract = {Serious Games for Learning are often designed as singleplayer, storytelling-based games. Even though immersion into the story and adaption to the player's abilities are pedagogically well designed, players can have misconceptions or get stuck with game quests. Then they seek for assistance from friends or online. Accessing hints, solutions and help of others directly in the gaming context can improve the game play and learning experience. Additionally the users from Online Social Networks can be connected to the game as a valuable resource of know-how if they are provided with participation possibilities. The concept of Peer Education is valuable for teaching and assessment among peers with similar learning targets. Thus in this paper an approach towards Social Serious Games is presented. Existing Social Media interaction patterns and singleplayer, story-based game situations are brought together respecting the Interaction Mapping Patterns1:1 and 1:n. The resulting three dimensional Social Game Influence Taxonomy is presented as well as the technical implementation as a middleware to connect existing Serious Games with Online Social Networks for Peer Knowledge Sharing and participation.},

abstract = {Many collaborative applications, especially in scientific research, focus only on the sharing of tools or the sharing of data. We seek to introduce an approach to scientific collaboration that is based on the sharing of knowledge. We do this by automatically building organizational memory and enabling knowledge sharing by observing what users do with a particular tool or set of tools in the domain, through the addition of activity and usage monitoring facilities to standalone applications. Once this knowledge has been gathered, we apply social networking models to provide collaborative features to users, such as suggestions on tools to use, and automatically-generated sequences of actions based on past usage amongst the members of a social network or the entire community. In this work, we investigate social networking models as an approach to scientific knowledge sharing, and present an implementation called genSpace, which is built as an extension to the geWorkbench platform for computational biologists. Last, we discuss the approach from the viewpoint of social software engineering.},

Q&amp;A sites have emerged as an efficient way to address questions in various domains by leveraging crowd knowledge. However, they lack sufficient reliability to be the sole basis of customer service applications. We built a proof-of-concept mixed-initiative tool that helps a crowd-manager to decide if a question will get a satisfactory and timely answer by the crowd or if it should be redirected to a dedicated operator. A user experiment found that our tool reduced the participants' cognitive load and improved their performance, in terms of their precision and recall. In particular, those with higher performance benefited more than those with lower performance.},

abstract = {Crowdsourcing, where the power of the human thinking is harnessed to answer queries that are otherwise difficult for computers to answer, has been successfully used in many applications. A particularly interesting application of crowdsourcing is crowd mining, where given a dataset, patterns are learned by asking questions to the crowd. Crowd mining is extremely useful in situations where either the information is complex or it is not available in a systematic manner. In this paper, we target one such scenario, that of common health practices and cures. A web-based framework, called MineAr, is built to ask simple questions to the crowd. The questions ask whether a common product helps in a disease (such as ginger for cold). The crowd worker can choose an answer from different grades varying from "always" to "never", or can skip if she is not sure. Association rules are then mined from these answers using different aggregation techniques. Since not all the crowd workers can be relied upon, the system takes into account the confidence of the workers and, consequently, the rules are ordered according to importance. We also enhance the framework to enable prediction of answers of a new question for a crowd worker using her history. Finally, we construct a knowledge graph for searching and visualization.},

abstract = {Question answering (Q&amp;A) websites are now large repositories of valuable knowledge. While most Q&amp;A sites were initially aimed at providing useful answers to the question asker, there has been a marked shift towards question answering as a community-driven knowledge creation process whose end product can be of enduring value to a broad audience. As part of this shift, specific expertise and deep knowledge of the subject at hand have become increasingly important, and many Q&amp;A sites employ voting and reputation mechanisms as centerpieces of their design to help users identify the trustworthiness and accuracy of the content.To better understand this shift in focus from one-off answers to a group knowledge-creation process, we consider a question together with its entire set of corresponding answers as our fundamental unit of analysis, in contrast with the focus on individual question-answer pairs that characterized previous work. Our investigation considers the dynamics of the community activity that shapes the set of answers, both how answers and voters arrive over time and how this influences the eventual outcome. For example, we observe significant assortativity in the reputations of co-answerers, relationships between reputation and answer speed, and that the probability of an answer being chosen as the best one strongly depends on temporal characteristics of answer arrivals. We then show that our understanding of such properties is naturally applicable to predicting several important quantities, including the long-term value of the question and its answers, as well as whether a question requires a better answer. Finally, we discuss the implications of these results for the design of Q&amp;A sites.},

We illustrate how two specific organisational innovations - the Management Information and Research department and the Information Brokers acted as go-betweens for the various levels of the AAPD and the effective design and use of the informational systems. To make our study concrete, we highlight the use of the Early Warning System and Data Detective tool in support of their capacity management process for law enforcement activities. We conclude this descriptive case study with the key building blocks of this case, and we suggest that an enterprise-wide view and knowledge-based perspective be incorporated in future research on operationalised BI environments.},

This paper argues that collaborative questioning, which is a form of group interjection in a question is a useful learning tool. It exploits the ubiquitous SMS texting coupled with the power of the web to create an anonymous collaborative questioning environment. The paper reports on the case study in which students interrogate an academic text and collaboratively ask questions using SMS.},

By directly interacting with other participants, information seekers can obtain specific answers to their questions. However, user success in obtaining satisfactory answers varies greatly. We hypothesize that satisfaction with the contributed answers is largely determined by the asker's prior experience, expectations, and personal preferences. Hence, we begin to develop personalized models of asker satisfaction to predict whether a particular question author will be satisfied with the answers contributed by the community participants. We formalize this problem, and explore a variety of content, structure, and interaction features for this task using standard machine learning techniques. Our experimental evaluation over thousands of real questions indicates that indeed it is beneficial to personalize satisfaction predictions when sufficient prior user history exists, significantly improving accuracy over a "one-size-fits-all" prediction model.},

In order to sustain success, Q&amp;A sites face the challenges of ensuring content quality and encouraging user contributions. This paper examines a particular design decision in Q&amp;A sites-allowing Wikipedia-like collaborative editing on questions and answers, and explores its beneficial effects on content quality and potential detrimental effects on users' contributions. By examining five years' archival data of Stack Overflow, we found that the benefits of collaborative editing outweigh its risks. For example, each substantive edit from other users can increase the number of positive votes by 181\% for the questions and 119\% for the answers. On the other hand, each edit only decreases askers and answerers' subsequent contributions by no more than 5\%.

Recently the rate of scientific knowledge production is overwhelming the ability for researchers to process it. Semantic web technologies may help to handle this vast amount of scientific knowledge. However, automatic computerized techniques that extract semantics from natural language text for use in matching with the requests of knowledge seekers achieve only mediocre results. Clearly, semantic descriptions of expert knowledge that are constructed by the knowledge creators themselves will be more accurate. We report an approach and software implementation of a knowledge sharing platform based on semantic web technologies, called EKOSS for expert knowledge ontology-based semantic search, that helps knowledge creators construct semantic descriptions of their knowledge. The EKOSS system enables knowledge creators to construct computer-interpretable semantically rich statements describing their knowledge with minimal effort and without any knowledge of semantic web technologies.},

abstract = {Tens of thousands of questions are asked and answered every day on social question and answer (Q&amp;A) Web sites such as Yahoo Answers. While these sites generate an enormous volume of searchable data, the problem of determining which questions and answers are archival quality has grown. One major component of this problem is the prevalence of conversational questions, identified both by Q&amp;A sites and academic literature as questions that are intended simply to start discussion. For example, a conversational question such as "do you believe in evolution?" might successfully engage users in discussion, but probably will not yield a useful web page for users searching for information about evolution. Using data from three popular Q&amp;A sites, we confirm that humans can reliably distinguish between these conversational questions and other informational questions, and present evidence that conversational questions typically have much lower potential archival value than informational questions. Further, we explore the use of machine learning techniques to automatically classify questions as conversational or informational, learning in the process about categorical, linguistic, and social differences between different question types. Our algorithms approach human performance, attaining 89.7\% classification accuracy in our experiments.},

abstract = {Generating source code API sequences from an English query using Machine Translation (MT) has gained much interest in recent years. For any kind of MT, the model needs to be trained on a parallel corpus. In this paper we clean StackOverflow, one of the most popular online discussion forums for programmers, to generate a parallel English-Code corpus from Android posts. We contrast three data cleaning approaches: standard NLP, title only, and software task extraction. We evaluate the quality of the each corpus for MT. To provide indicators of how useful each corpus will be for machine translation, we provide researchers with measurements of the corpus size, percentage of unique tokens, and per-word maximum likelihood alignment entropy. We have used these corpus cleaning approaches to translate between English and Code [22, 23], to compare existing SMT approaches from word mapping to neural networks [24], and to re-examine the "natural software" hypothesis [29]. After cleaning and aligning the data, we create a simple maximum likelihood MT model to show that English words in the corpus map to a small number of specific code elements. This model provides a basis for the success of using StackOverflow for search and other tasks in the software engineering literature and paves the way for MT. Our scripts and corpora are publicly available on GitHub [1] as well as at https://search.datacite.org/works/10.5281/zenodo.2558551.},

abstract = {StackOverflow provides answers for a huge number of software development questions that are frequently encountered by developers. However, searching relevant questions in StackOverflow is not always easy using the keyword based search engine provided by StackOverflow. A software development question can be characterized by multiple attributes, such as, its concern (e.g., configuration problem, error handling, sample code, etc.), programming language, operating system, and involved middleware, framework, library and software technology. We propose a multi-faceted and interactive approach for searching StackOverflow questions (called MFISSO), which leverages these attributes of the questions. Our approach starts with an initial keyword-based query and extracts a multifaceted categorization from all the candidate questions using natural language processing and data mining. It then allows developers to iteratively refine the search results through an interactive process. We evaluated an implementation of MFISSO in a controlled experiments with 20 computing students, solving ten software development tasks using StackOverflow. The experiment shows that MFISSO can help developers find relevant questions faster and with higher accuracy.},

We considered questions from SO tagged with WebGL or Three.js and extracted all tags used on these questions. Using these, we were able to compare the relative attention (considering the number of questions and views) and support (considering satisfactory answers and how long they take) received by concerns and technologies associated to WebGL and Three.js. Our results suggest that Three.js gets significantly more community attention but less community support than WebGL on SO.},

In this paper, we investigate how often GitHub developers re-use code snippets from the SO forum, as well as what concepts they are more likely to reference in their code. To accomplish our goal, we mine SOTorrent dataset that provides connectivity between code snippets on the SO posts with software projects hosted on GitHub. We then study the characteristics of GitHub projects that reference SO posts and discover popular SO discussions that happen in GitHub projects. Our results demonstrate that on average developers make 45 references to SO posts in their projects, with the highest number of references being made within the JavaScript code. We also found that 79\% of the SO posts with code snippets that are referenced in GitHub code do change over time (at least ones) raising code maintainability and reliability concerns.},

StackOverflow is a very popular Q&amp;A website about computer programming accessed by approximately 21 million professional developers and university-level students. The primary purpose reported in this paper is to assess the impact of using the StackOverflow Q&amp;A resource as an add-in supplement to enhance students' learning achievements. The study sample consisted of 38 undergraduate students who enrolled in a database module. Students were divided in control and experimental group. Pre-tests and post-tests were conducted with both groups in the chosen subject. A comparison was made between the treatment group, which used StackOverflow Q&amp;A as a tutorial tool, and the control group, which studied the same topic using a traditional learning format (set of printed exercises as well as text book examples). Our results show how both the experimental group and the control group significantly improved their performance in the post-test. While the experimental group improved their performance more than the control group, the gap was not significant. The results enable it to conclude that StackOverflow material was at least as effective as the traditional material. The finding may be useful in offering new perspectives towards computer science pedagogy that will provide students with more authentic practice to prepare them for their future careers.},

abstract = {Stack Overflow is a popular on-line programming question and answer community providing its participants with rapid access to knowledge and expertise of their peers, especially benefitting coders. Despite the popularity of Stack Overflow, its role in the work cycle of open-source developers is yet to be understood: on the one hand, participation in it has the potential to increase the knowledge of individual developers thus improving and speeding up the development process. On the other hand, participation in Stack Overflow may interrupt the regular working rhythm of the developer, hence also possibly slow down the development process. In this paper we investigate the interplay between Stack Overflow activities and the development process, reflected by code changes committed to the largest social coding repository, GitHub. Our study shows that active GitHub committers ask fewer questions and provide more answers than others. Moreover, we observe that active Stack Overflow askers distribute their work in a less uniform way than developers that do not ask questions. Finally, we show that despite the interruptions incurred, the Stack Overflow activity rate correlates with the code changing activity in GitHub.},

With more than three lakh users and ten lakh questions, StackOverflow is emerging as the biggest QA forum for programmers. The questions on StackOverflow cover a wide range of topics and are categorized using appropriate tags. Currently the tags are entered manually by users depending on their judgment of the tags. Since there are a huge number of tags, it is often a cumbersome process to search the correct tags. It may be useful to have an auto-tagging system that suggests tags to users depending on the content of the question.In this paper we present a hybrid auto-tagging system for SO. The auto-tagging system includes a) programming language detection system b) SVM based question classification system. This system will suggest tags once a user enters a question.},

abstract = {Internet Relay Chat (IRC) is a commonly used tool by OpenSource developers. Developers use IRC channels to discuss programming related problems, but much of the discussion is irrelevant and off-topic. Essentially if we treat IRC discussions like email messages, and apply spam filtering, we can try to filter out the spam (the off-topic discussions) from the ham (the programming discussions). Yet we need labelled data that unfortunately takes time to curate.To avoid costly curration in order to filter out off-topic discussions, we need positive and negative data-sources. Online discussion forums, such as StackOverflow, are very effective for solving programming problems. By engaging in open-data, StackOverflow data becomes a powerful source of labelled text regarding programming. This work shows that we can train classifiers using StackOverflow posts as positive examples of on-topic programming discussion. YouTube video comments, notorious for their lack of quality, serve as training set of off-topic discussion. By exploiting these datasets, accurate classifiers can be built, tested and evaluated that require very little effort for end-users to deploy and exploit.},

As a result, these websites have become valuable knowledge repositories, covering a wealth of topics related to particular programming languages. This knowledge is even more useful as the developer community evaluates both questions and answers through a voting mechanism. As votes accumulate, the developer community recognizes reputed members and further trusts their answers. In this paper, we analyze the community's questions and answers to determine the developers' personality traits, using the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC). We explore the personality traits of Stack Overflow authors by categorizing them into different categories based on their reputation. Through textual analysis of Stack Overflow posts, we found that the top reputed authors are more extroverted compared to medium and low reputed users. Moreover, authors of up-voted posts express significantly less negative emotions than authors of down-voted posts.},

abstract = {Developer forums like StackOverflow have become essential resources to modern software development practices. However, many code snippets lack a well-defined method declaration, and thus they are often incomplete for immediate reuse. Developers must adapt the retrieved code snippets by parameterizing the variables involved and identifying the return value. This activity, which we call APIzation of a code snippet, can be tedious and time-consuming. In this paper, we present APIzator to perform APIzations of Java code snippets automatically. APIzator is grounded by four common patterns that we extracted by studying real APIzations in GitHub. APIzator presents a static analysis algorithm that automatically extracts the method parameters and return statements. We evaluated APIzator with a ground-truth of 200 APIzations collected from 20 developers. For 113 (56.50 \%) and 115 (57.50 \%) APIzations, APIzator and the developers extracted identical parameters and return statements, respectively. For 163 (81.50 \%) APIzations, either the parameters or the return statements were identical.},

Recently, Treude et al. manually label 385 questions in StackOverflow and group them into 10 categories based on their contents. They also analyze how tags are used in StackOverflow. In this study, we extend their work to obtain a deeper understanding on how developers interact with one another on such a question and answer web site. First, we analyze the distributions of developers who ask and answer questions. We also investigate if there is a segregation of the StackOverflow community into questioners and answerers. We also perform automated text mining to find the various kinds of topics asked by developers. We use Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), a well known topic modeling approach, to analyze the contents of tens of thousands of questions and answers, and produce five topics. Our topic modeling strategy provides an alternative perspective different from that of Treude et al. for categorizing StackOverflow questions. Each question can now be categorized into several topics with different probabilities, and the learned topic model could automatically assign a new question to several categories with varying probabilities. Last but not least, we show the distributions of questions and developers belonging to various topics generated by LDA.},

abstract = {User queries on StackOverflow commonly suffer from either inadequate length or inadequate clarity with regards to the languages and/or tools they are meant for. Although the site makes use of a tagging system for classifying questions, tags are used minimally (if at all). To investigate the impact of tags in the quality of results returned by the queries, in this research we propose a new query expansion solution. Our technique assigns tags to queries based on how well they match the queries' topics. To evaluate our solution, we examined our technique on eight sets of queries categorized by overall length and programming language. We examined the retrieval results by adding various number of tags to the queries and monitor the recall and precision rates. Our results indicate that queries yield considerably higher recall and precision rates with extra tags than without. We further conclude that tags are particularly an effective means of enhancement when the original queries do not already return sufficient yields to begin with.},

abstract = {A crowdsourcing system such as Amazon's Mechanical Turk allows a crowdsource campaign initiator to recruit a large number of workers to accomplish a task. The proper design of such a crowdsourcing system becomes very challenging when the task involves multiple interdependent micro-tasks, and the initiator wants the task to be completed with the minimal cost and a high probability of success. In this paper, we address this challenge by designing an EI (Effort Incentivization) mechanism, which utilizes the peer effect to incentivize workers to act according to the initiator's best interest. We prove that EI is Bayesian incentive compatible and Bayesian individually rational. Our analysis shows that when there are multiple sequential interdependent micro-tasks, the initiator should provide higher rewards to those workers responsible for completing later stage micro-tasks. When there is a flexibility regarding the worker assignment to each micro-task, the initiator should assign fewer workers to later stage micro-tasks to minimize the initiator's overall payment. Numerical results show that our proposed EI mechanism can reduce the initiator's total payment by more than 70\%, compared to a fixed reward mechanism. By optimizing the numbers of workers assigned to different interdependent micro-tasks, the initiator can reduce the total payment by up to 50\% compared to a random assignment scheme.},

abstract = {Crowdsourcing is a favorable computing paradigm for processing computer-hard tasks by harnessing human intelligence. However, generic crowdsourcing systems may lead to privacy-leakage through the sharing of worker data. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel approach, called iFedCrowd (incentive-boosted Federated Crowdsourcing), to manage the privacy and quality of crowdsourcing projects. iFedCrowd allows participants to locally process sensitive data and only upload encrypted training models, and then aggregates the model parameters to build a shared server model to protect data privacy. To motivate workers to build a high-quality global model in an efficacy way, we introduce an incentive mechanism that encourages workers to constantly collect fresh data to train accurate client models and boosts the global model training. We model the incentive-based interaction between the crowdsourcing platform and participating workers as a Stackelberg game, in which each side maximizes its own profit. We derive the Nash Equilibrium of the game to find the optimal solutions for the two sides. Experimental results confirm that iFedCrowd can complete secure crowd-sourcing projects with high quality and efficiency.},

abstract = {Increasingly governments engage the crowd through online platforms to generate innovation and utilize collaborative platforms for AI adoptions as a governance strategy. This study aims to investigate the factors associated with terminated and implemented smart city or AI related technologies projects through qualitative analysis. This study selected a setting based on the Taipei Smart City Industrial Field Experiment Pilot Program since 2016. We collected online achieved data of the smart city proposals from 2016 to April 2023 (N=295). Based on those achieved data with descriptions for termination and implementation, this paper discusses the opportunities, challenges, and suggestions for overcoming such challenges of the SmartTaipei Project. Given that governments do not provide financial support for smart city pilot projects, enterprises acquire opportunities to experiment with and thus improve their products or services. The successful experiment is conducive to research and development, business expansion, and even government procurement. However, despite the fact that the SmartTaipei proposals and projects have been discussed and modified several times before implementation, 41.7\% of the projects were terminated due to several reasons. We classify the total number of AI technologies adopted across all projects. We also use the Technology Enactment Framework as the analysis framework to summarize the reason why nearly 41.7\% of the project (N=123) were terminated. To address the challenges of building smart cities, this paper suggests that municipal governments (1) build up platforms for stakeholder participation and assess progressive results, (2) develop a comprehensive development strategy and enhance digital infrastructure, and (3) develop a convention for international exchange.},

The two driving mechanisms for filtering out low quality posts and highlighting the best answers are community votes and the mark of acceptance by the original question asker. But does the asker's choice always match the popular vote? If so, is the asker's choice influenced by the community vote or is the community vote biased towards the accepted answer? And if the asker and community disagree, then can we determine any particular characteristics of posts that influence the choice of the asker and community differently, such as its size, readability, presence of code snippets and external links as well as similarity to the original question? In this paper, we explore the answers to these questions by studying a data-set of all posts on StackOverflow from its launch in September 2008 to September 2014.},

 consider a contest game modelling a contest where reviews for a proposal are crowdsourced from nplayers. Player i has a skillsi, strategically chooses a qualityq∈{1,2,…,Q} for her review and pays an effortfq≥0, strictly increasing with q. Under voluntary participation, a player may opt to not write a review, paying zero effort; mandatory participation does not provide this option. For her effort, she is awarded a payment per her payment function, which is either player-invariant, like, e.g., the popular proportional allocation, or player-specific; it is oblivious when it does not depend on the numbers of players choosing a different quality. The utility to player i is the difference between her payment and her cost, calculated by a skill-effort function Λ(si,fq). Skills may vary for arbitrary players; anonymous players means si=1 for all players i. In a pure Nash equilibrium, no player could unilaterally increase her utility by switching to a different quality. We show the following results about the existence and the computation of a pure Nash equilibrium:We present an exact potential to show the existence of a pure Nash equilibrium for the contest game with arbitrary players and player-invariant and oblivious payments. A particular case of this result provides an answer to an open question from&nbsp;[6]. In contrast, a pure Nash equilibrium might not exist (i) for player-invariant payments, even if players are anonymous, (ii) for proportional allocation payments and arbitrary players, and (iii) for player-specific payments, even if players are anonymous; in the last case, it is NP-hard to tell. These counterexamples prove the tightness of our existence result.We show that the contest game with proportional allocation, voluntary participation and anonymous players has the Finite Improvement Property, or FIP; this yields two pure Nash equilibria. The FIP carries over to mandatory participation, except that there is now a single pure Nash equilibrium. For arbitrary players, we determine a simple sufficient condition for the FIP in the special case where the skill-effort function has the product form Λ(si,fq)=sifq.We introduce a novel, discrete concavity property of player-specific payments, namely three-discrete-concavity, which we exploit to devise, for constant Q, a polynomial-time Θ(nQ) algorithm to compute a pure Nash equilibrium in the contest game with arbitrary players; it is a special case of a ΘnQ2n+Q-1Q-1 algorithm for arbitrary Q that we present. Thus, the problem is XP-tractable with respect to the parameter Q. The computed equilibrium is contiguous: players with higher skills are contiguously assigned to lower qualities. Both three-discrete-concavity and the algorithm extend naturally to player-invariant payments.},

abstract = {Crowdsourcing has facilitated a wide range of applications by leveraging public workers to contribute large number of tasks. However, most prior works only considered static environments and overlooked the system dynamics. In practice, the task set to be allocated is time-varying and the workers may be strategic when deciding whether to accept the tasks. In this paper, we formulate the online crowdsourcing problem as a sequential optimization problem, where a requestor needs to allocate tasks repeatedly to the workers to maximize the long-term cumulative utility. To deal with the dynamics, we first build an environmental model to predict the system dynamics. The model can also embed the tasks into a fixed lower-dimensional space. Next, we propose a multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm to optimize the allocation mechanism for the requestor. The underlying intuition is that the mechanism can be robust even with adversarial workers. In the experiment, we conducted extensive experiments to evaluate the performance. The results validate that our method can achieve the best performance in almost all cases. The results are robust when deployed in an adversarial environment.},

Theodon uses Gaussian processes to model the non-uniformity of mistakes over the range of classifier scores.

abstract = {In crowdsourcing scenarios, researchers can obtain each instance’s multiple noisy label set from crowd workers and then infer its integrated label via label integration. To further improve the quality of integrated labels, many noise correction algorithms have been proposed in recent years. Most of them are trying to get a clean set and a noise set, and then train classifiers on the clean set to correct the instances in the noise set. However, the class distribution of the clean set is often inconsistent with that of the noise set, which leads to a poor correction performance of the trained classifiers. To reduce the inconsistency between the class distributions of the clean set and the noise set, this paper proposes an instance weighting-based noise correction (IWNC) algorithm. IWNC at first calculates each class’s weight based on the class distribution of the clean set. Then IWNC calculates each instance’s weight using the weight of the class that its integrated label belongs to and its multiple noisy label set. Finally, IWNC trains a classifier on the instance weighted clean set to correct the instances in the noise set. The experimental results on 34 simulated and two real-world datasets indicate that IWNC significantly outperforms all the other state-of-the-art noise correction algorithms.},

There are practices for breaking down software projects into manageable tasks, known as task decomposition. This study identified task decomposition techniques in software engineering, particularly in the context of CSD. Then, we defined the experienced developers who lead the requester in decomposing the project, preparing tasks, and reviewing submissions. This study explored and addressed decomposition approaches in CSD. Next, we selected projects in TopCoder to identify the task decomposition process in the CSD context. Finally, we concluded with future research directions for investigating decomposition approaches and their effects in the CSD context to ensure successful crowdsourced software projects.},

State-of-the-art attack mechanisms generally assume full knowledge of the aggregation models while failing to consider the flexibility of malicious workers in selecting which instances to label. Such a setup limits the applicability of the attack mechanisms and impedes further improvement of their success rate. This paper introduces a blackbox data poisoning attack framework that finds the optimal strategies for instance selection and labeling to attack unknown label aggregation models in crowdsourcing. We formulate the attack problem on top of a generic formalization of label aggregation models and then introduce a substitution approach that attacks a substitute aggregation model in replacement of the unknown model. Through extensive validation on multiple real-world datasets, we demonstrate the effectiveness of both instance selection and model substitution in improving the success rate of attacks.},

However, some workers communicate with each other and share answers during the crowdsourcing process. This is referred to as “collusion”. Copying from others and submitting repeated answers are detrimental to the quality of the tasks. Existing studies on collusion detection focus on ground truth problems (e.g., labeling tasks) and require a fixed threshold to be set in advance. In this paper, we aim to detect collusion behavior of workers in an adaptive way, and propose an Adaptive Clustering Based Collusion Detection approach (ACCD) for a broad range of task types and data types solved via crowdsourcing (e.g., continuous rating with or without distributions). Extensive experiments on both real-world and synthetic datasets show the superiority of ACCD over state-of-the-art approaches.},

It is often impossible to duplicate these optimal allocations when agents imperfectly observe object characteristics. I present a crowdsourcing mechanism to approximate optimal allocations under imperfect observations. To ensure truth-telling, agents are punished when their reports differ from the "wisdom of the crowd." Under mild conditions, this crowdsourcing-with-punishment mechanism replicates the full-information optimal allocation with probability exponentially converging to one in the size of the market, with aggregate worst-case waste (punishment) converging exponentially to zero. I show that no other mechanism can meaningfully improve upon the proposed mechanism. The approach I take is general, and can be applied in many settings, including two-sided matching markets.Link to full version of paper: https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2618837},

This work considers the budget allocation problem for a generalized setting on a graph of instances to be labeled where edges encode instance dependencies. Specifically, given a graph and a labeling budget, we propose an optimal policy to allocate the budget among the instances to maximize the overall labeling accuracy. We formulate the problem as a Bayesian Markov Decision Process (MDP), where we define our task as an optimization problem that maximizes the overall label accuracy under budget constraints. Then, we propose a novel stage-wise reward function that considers the effect of worker labels on the whole graph at each timestamp. This reward function is utilized to find an optimal policy for the optimization problem. Theoretically, we show that our proposed policies are consistent when the budget is infinite. We conduct extensive experiments on five real-world graph datasets and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed policies to achieve a higher label accuracy under budget constraints.},

Various methods have been used at different stages of algorithm development to encourage researchers and designers to consider the potential societal impact of their research. An understudied yet promising area in this realm is using participatory foresight to anticipate these different societal impacts. We employ crowdsourcing as a means of participatory foresight to uncover four different types of impact areas based on a set of governmental algorithmic decision making tools: (1) perceived valence, (2) societal domains, (3) specific abstract impact types, and (4) ethical algorithm concerns. Our findings suggest that this method is effective at leveraging the cognitive diversity of the crowd to uncover a range of issues. We further analyze the complexities within the interaction of the impact areas identified to demonstrate how crowdsourcing can illuminate patterns around the connections between impacts. Ultimately this work establishes crowdsourcing as an effective means of anticipating algorithmic impact which complements other approaches towards assessing algorithms in society by leveraging participatory foresight and cognitive diversity.},

This work deals with constrained crowdsourced classification with instance-level constraints, that capture relationships between pairs of data. A Bayesian algorithm based on variational inference is developed, and its quantifiably improved performance, compared to unsupervised crowdsourcing, is analytically and empirically validated on several crowdsourcing datasets.},

abstract = {We propose an autonomous crowdsourcing system for constructing high-quality task results. To change the minds of low-quality workers while processing the tasks, we introduce implicit and explicit feedback. If task results are of low quality, the requesters should tell the workers whether the quality of the task results is high/low and how to improve their work. However, providing detailed and accurate feedback in real-time is difficult and time-consuming for requesters. Our method mitigates this issue by providing feedback for workers using the majority voting (implicit feedback) and the other workers directly (explicit feedback). To confirm the effectiveness of our method, we constructed a crowdsourcing system for processing a large-scale sentiment analysis task and experimented with evaluating the method. We found that our scalable crowdsourcing-based quality management method could improve task results by using implicit feedback and improved worker motivation by providing explicit feedback.},

abstract = {In this paper we are interested in opportunistic network-based (ON-based) mobile crowdsourcing (MCS), where a requester (called a server) assigns a set of tasks to a pool of workers, and the workers process the assigned tasks for payoff. The key to success such an ON-based MCS is how to design task assignment strategy. The existing task assignment algorithms are primarily designed to maximize the task completion rate or to minimize the makespan. To the best of our knowledge, there is no work on the task assignment with a time-decaying utility model, where task utility decreases over time. Therefore, in this paper, we first introduce the utility-based task assignment problem with a time-decaying utility model for ON-based MCS. Then, the utility-based task assignment (UTA) algorithm is proposed based on the greedy strategy that dynamically assigns tasks to contacted workers. The performance of the proposed scheme is evaluated using a real mobility trace, called CRAWDAD, and the simulation results demonstrate that the proposed UTA outperforms the one of the existing online task assignment algorithms.},

abstract = {In congestion games, users make myopic routing decisions to jam each other, and the social planner with the full information designs mechanisms on information or payment side to regulate. However, it is difficult to obtain time-varying traffic conditions, and emerging crowdsourcing platforms (e.g., Waze and Google Maps) provide a convenient way for mobile users travelling on the paths to learn and share the traffic conditions over time. When congestion games meet mobile crowdsourcing, it is critical to incentive selfish users to change their myopic routing policy and reach the best exploitation-exploration trade-off. By considering a simple but fundamental parallel routing network with one deterministic path and multiple stochastic paths for atomic users, we prove that the myopic routing policy's price of anarchy (PoA) can be arbitrarily large as the discount factor approaches 1. To remedy such huge efficiency loss, we propose a selective information disclosure (SID) mechanism: we only reveal the latest traffic information to users when they intend to over-explore the stochastic paths, while hiding such information when they want to under-explore. We prove that our mechanism reduces PoA to less than 2. Besides the worst-case performance, we further examine our mechanism's average-case performance by using extensive simulations.},

abstract = {With the fast-paced development of mobile networks and the widespread usage of mobile devices, Spatial Crowdsourcing (SC) has drawn increasing attention in recent years. SC has the potential for collecting information for a broad range of applications such as on-demand local delivery and on-demand transportation. One of the critical issues in SC is task assignment that allocates location-based tasks (e.g., delivering food and packages) to appropriate moving workers (i.e., intelligent device carriers). In this paper, we study a loyalty-based task assignment problem, which aims to maximize the overall rewards of workers while considering worker loyalty. We propose a two-phase framework to solve the problem, including a worker loyalty prediction and a task assignment phase. In the first phase, we use a model based on an efficient time series prediction method called Prophet and an Entropy Weighting method to extract workers' short-term and long-term loyalty and then predict workers' current loyalty scores. In the task assignment phase, we design a Kuhn-Munkras-based algorithm that achieves the optimal task assignment and an efficient Degree-Reduction-based algorithm with minority first scheme. Extensive experiments offer insight into the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed solutions.},

abstract = {With the development of GPS-enabled smart devices and wireless networks, mobile crowdsourcing (MCS) has received wide attention in assigning location-sensitive tasks to mobile users. The task assignment problem, in which tasks are released on the platforms and then assigned to available users, is a fundamental problem in MCS. However, existing works generally consider users’ category preference and mobile preference separately. Ignorance of the correlation between them could lead to poor assignment results. To this end, We propose a framework, Task Assignment with User Preference Learning, which consists of two components: 1) Fused User Preference Learning (FUP); and 2) Preference-Based Task Assignment. The first component called FUP is a fusion of task-category preference learning and spatial-temporal preference learning. For task-category preference learning, we propose a graph session-based learning model with attention components to exploit users’ sparse historical records. To our knowledge, we are the first to use a graph session-based learning model to explore task-category preference in MCS. Meanwhile, we propose an efficient function metric to characterize the spatial-temporal preference of users. The second component aims to achieve effective task assignment, in which we give higher priorities to users with higher preference scores for the tasks. Extensive evaluations of real data show the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed solutions.},

abstract = {With the prevalence of mobile devices and ubiquitous wireless networks, spatial crowdsourcing has attracted much attention from both academic and industry communities. On spatial crowdsourcing platforms, task requesters can publish spatial tasks and workers need to move to destinations to perform them. This paper formally defines a new problem, i.e., the Skilled Task Assignment with Extra Budget (STAEB), which aims to maximize total platform revenue. In the STAEB problem, the complex task needs more than one worker to satisfy its skill requirement and has the extra budget to subsidize extra travel costs of workers to attract more workers. We prove that the STAEB problem is NP-complete. Therefore, two approximation algorithms are proposed to solve it, including greedy and game-theoretic approaches. Extensive experiments on both real and synthetic datasets demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our proposed approaches.},

abstract = {Context: Crowdsourcing software development (CSSD) is a form of collective intelligence that is gaining attention in the Information Technology industry as a work alternative for software projects. CSSD represents a paradigm shift in the in-house development approach, promising deliveries with quality, productivity and innovation. Problem: CSSD is an emerging approach, both in research and in practice. Despite the existence of commercial supporting platforms, organizations of different sizes still face the challenge of how to organize the collective work, and a clear definition of how to perform CSSD is not known yet. Solution: This article presents an analysis of the literature to identify the main processes, practices, tools and platforms used in CSSD initiatives, and to understand the benefits and challenges reported in these initiatives as well. IS theory: Not applicable. Method: Descriptive research based on systematic literature mapping. Summary of Results: CSSD is understood as a democratic alternative with great potential for improving quality, productivity and innovation in software projects. However, challenges for its realization are many and of different kinds (technical, managerial, methodological and legal). Results also show not a large amount of CSSD case study reports in real situations. Contributions and Impact on the IS area: This work provides an overview of CSSD application, as well as a critical analysis of its advantages and challenges, contributing with discussions to the challenge of Information Systems and the Open World. This overview enables reflection on the adoption of CSSD, stimulating the research of solutions under development by crowds for companies of different sizes.},

Scholarly knowledge graphs have the potential to address these challenges. However, creating such graphs remains a complex task. We propose a method to crowdsource structured scholarly knowledge from paper authors with a web-based user interface supported by artificial intelligence. The interface enables authors to select key sentences for annotation. It integrates multiple machine learning algorithms to assist authors during the annotation, including class recommendation and key sentence highlighting. We envision that the interface is integrated in paper submission processes for which we define three main task requirements: The task has to be . We evaluated the interface with a user study in which participants were assigned the task to annotate one of their own articles. With the resulting data, we determined whether the participants were successfully able to perform the task. Furthermore, we evaluated the interface’s usability and the participant’s attitude towards the interface with a survey. The results suggest that sentence annotation is a feasible task for researchers and that they do not object to annotate their articles during the submission process.},

We propose and study a novel SC framework, namely Task Assignment with Task Publication Time Recommendation. The framework consists of two phases, task publication time recommendation and task assignment. More specifically, the task publication time recommendation phase hybrids different learning models to recommend the suitable publication time for each task to ensure the timely task assignment and completion while reducing the waiting time of the task requester at the SC platform. We use a cross-graph neural network to learn the representations of task requesters by integrating the obtained representations from two semantic spaces and utilize the self-attention mechanism to learn the representations of task-publishing sequences from multiple perspectives. Then a fully connected layer is used to predict suitable task publication time based on the obtained representations. In the task assignment phase, we propose a greedy and a minimum cost maximum flow algorithm to achieve the efficient and the optimal task assignment, respectively. An extensive empirical study demonstrates the effectiveness and efficiency of our framework.},

abstract = {Taxonomy is an indispensable part of Knowledge Base. Taxonomy Enrichment is the task that new instances are classified to possibly thousands of concepts of an existing taxonomy. Recent works considered to enrich a taxonomy by crowdsourcing [17, 24] to promote the quality of new instance classification. However, the broad coverage of knowledge induced by a large taxonomy makes it a skill-sensitive knowledge-intensive crowdsourcing (KI-C) task. Naively applying existing skill estimation methods [23, 25, 36] for quality control requires quizzes on each concept of the taxonomy, which is prohibitive for large scale Taxonomy Enrichment. In this work, we propose a unified crowdsourcing framework to mitigate both challenges. It leverages the skill locality of workers with a Graph Gaussian Process model. Our quality control method automatically matches instances with a worker’s expertise and gives hints for later workers to reduce their time to search over the taxonomy. In our experiments with 314 workers, our method outperforms baseline BTSK [9] by 6.6\% in terms of accuracy on a taxonomy of 10 levels and 632 nodes.},

abstract = {Requesters on crowdsourcing platforms like Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) compensate workers inadequately. One potential reason for the underpayment is that the AMT’s requester interface provides limited information about estimated wages, preventing requesters from knowing if they are offering a fair piece-rate reward. To assess if presenting wage information affects requesters’ reward setting behaviors, we conducted a controlled study with 63 participants. We had three levels for a between-subjects factor in a mixed design study, where we provided participants with: no wage information, wage point estimate, and wage distribution. Each participant had three stages of adjusting the reward and controlling the estimated wage. Our analysis with Bayesian growth curve modeling suggests that the estimated wage derived from the participant-set reward increased from $2.56/h to $2.69/h and $2.33/h to $2.74/h when we provided point estimate and distribution information respectively. The wage decreased from $2.06/h to $1.99/h in the control condition.},

abstract = {Mobile crowdsourcing (MC) which has been developed rapidly in recent years is playing an increasingly indispensable role in people’s daily lives such as taxi-hailing, food delivery and other services. The geographic equilibrium of service supply and demand is crucial so that the MC system could guarantee more promising matches in a more regionally balanced way. However, due to the spatial dynamic of MC environments, the emergence of supply and demand is unpredictable, asymmetric, and constantly changing among different regions and throughout the day, presenting considerable challenges to the MC platform. In this paper, we propose a hybrid reinforcement learning and transformer-based balancing framework (HRB) to achieve geographically balanced coverage of MC services, considering both the imbalanced state of service supply-demand geographical distribution and the moving willingness of MC participants. The HRB framework is developed based on the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient strategy, which includes an actor-critic network for generating migration strategies and a Willingness Transformer (WiT) model for predicting the migration willingness of both mobile service providers and demanders among different regions.

abstract = {Human data labeling is an important and expensive task at the heart of supervised learning systems. Hierarchies help humans understand and organize concepts. We ask whether and how concept hierarchies can inform the design of annotation interfaces to improve labeling quality and efficiency. We study this question through annotation of vaccine misinformation, where the labeling task is difficult and highly subjective. We investigate 6 user interface designs for crowdsourcing hierarchical labels by collecting over 18,000 individual annotations. Under a fixed budget, integrating hierarchies into the design improves crowdsource workers’ F1 scores. We attribute this to (1) Grouping similar concepts, improving F1 scores by +0.16 over random groupings, (2) Strong relative performance on high-difficulty examples (relative F1 score difference of +0.40), and (3) Filtering out obvious negatives, increasing precision by +0.07. Ultimately, labeling schemes integrating the hierarchy outperform those that do not — achieving mean F1 of 0.70.},

abstract = {Solving mathematical problems is cognitively complex, involving strategy formulation, solution development, and the application of learned concepts. However, gaps in students' knowledge or weakly grasped concepts can lead to errors. Teachers play a crucial role in predicting and addressing these difficulties, which directly influence learning outcomes. However, preemptively identifying misconceptions leading to errors can be challenging. This study leverages historical data to assist teachers in recognizing common errors and addressing gaps in knowledge through feedback. We present a longitudinal analysis of incorrect answers from the 2015-2020 academic years on two curricula, Illustrative Math and EngageNY, for grades 6, 7, and 8. We find consistent errors across 5 years despite varying student and teacher populations. Based on these Common Wrong Answers (CWAs), we designed a crowdsourcing platform for teachers to provide Common Wrong Answer Feedback (CWAF). This paper reports on an in vivo randomized study testing the effectiveness of CWAFs in two scenarios: next-problem-correctness within-skill and next-problem-correctness within-assignment, regardless of the skill. We find that receiving CWAF leads to a significant increase in correctness for consecutive problems within-skill. However, the effect was not significant for all consecutive problems within-assignment, irrespective of the associated skill. This paper investigates the potential of scalable approaches in identifying Common Wrong Answers (CWAs) and how the use of crowdsourced CWAFs can enhance student learning through remediation.},

abstract = {With the proliferation of wireless and mobile devices, Spatial Crowdsourcing (SC) attracts increasing attention, where task assignment plays a critically important role. However, recent task assignment solutions in SC often assume that data is stored in a central station while ignoring the issue of privacy leakage. To enable decentralized training and privacy protection, we propose a federated task assignment framework with personalized location-preference learning, which performs efficient task assignment while keeping the data decentralized and private in each platform center (e.g., a delivery center of an SC company). The framework consists of two phases: personalized federated location-preference learning and task assignment. Specifically, in the first phase, we design a personalized location-preference learning model for each platform center by simultaneously considering the location information and data heterogeneity across platform centers. Based on workers' location preference, the task assignment phase aims to achieve effective and efficient task assignment by means of the Kuhn-Munkres (KM) algorithm and the newly proposed conditional degree-reduction algorithm. Extensive experiments on real-world data show the effectiveness of the proposed framework.},

abstract = {We study a covering problem motivated by spatial models in crowdsourcing markets, where tasks are ordered according to some geographic or temporal criterion. Assuming that each participating bidder can provide a certain level of contribution for a subset of consecutive tasks, and that each task has a demand requirement, the goal is to find a set of bidders of minimum cost, who can meet all the demand constraints. Our focus is on truthful mechanisms with approximation guarantees against the optimal cost. To this end, we obtain two main results. The first one, is a truthful mechanism that achieves a bounded approximation guarantee. This mechanism improves the state of the art, which is a mechanism with an arbitrarily large factor in worst case. The second one, concerns a class of instances that generalizes the minimum knapsack problem. Namely, we consider inputs with a constant number of tasks, for which we provide a truthful FPTAS. Finally, we also highlight connections of our problem with other well-studied optimization problems, out of which, we infer further conclusions on its (in)approximability.},

These games could allow for the combination of scalability through crowdsourcing and potentially higher ecological testing using fine-grained data acquisition from more natural settings. This development could also provide a promising a testbed for exploring human-AI creativity. However, success both in the design and implementation phases hinges on the games being both valid instruments for measuring creativity as well as engaging enough for the general public to want to play. This paper presents my initial PhD work focused on designing CREA: a suite of freely accessible digital games and tasks to understand and assess creativity. First I describe the CREA games and tasks, then discuss my considerations and challenges for operationalizing creativity within the games, present initial participant feedback, and discuss future work.},

An example of an application is to find the best hotel(s) with respect to some features (location, price, cleanliness, etc.)  The use of the crowd for solving this problem is useful when a score of items according to their features is not available. Yet the crowd can give inconsistent answers. In this paper we study the computation of the skyline when the comparisons between objects are performed by humans. We model the problem using the threshold model [Ajtai et al, TALG 2015] in which the comparison of two objects may create errors/inconsistencies if the objects are close to each other. We provide algorithms for the problem and we analyze the required number of human comparisons and lower bounds. We also evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of our algorithms using synthetic and real-world data.},

abstract = {In this work, we present and evaluate a crowdsourcing platform to collect wearable IoT data with local differential privacy (LDP). LDP protects privacy by perturbing data with noise, which may hinder their utility in some cases. For this reason, most researchers are wary of adopting it in their studies. To address these concerns, we consider the impact of different privacy budget values on the real wearable IoT data (steps, calories, distance, etc.) from N = 71 Fitbit users. Our goal is to demonstrate that, even if the collected information is protected with LDP, it is possible for data analysts to extract statistically significant insights on the studied population. To this end, we evaluate the error for various metrics of interest, such as sample average and empirical distribution. Furthermore, we verify that, in most cases, statistical tests produce the same results regardless of whether LDP has been applied or not. Our findings suggest that LDP with a privacy budget between 4 and 8 maintains an acceptable error of and over agreement on t-tests. Finally, we show that such values of privacy budget, albeit providing loose theoretical guarantees, can effectively defend against re-identification attacks on wearable IoT data.},

abstract = {Human Intelligence Tasks (HITs) allow people to collect and curate labeled data from multiple annotators. Then labels are often aggregated to create an annotated dataset suitable for supervised machine learning tasks. The most popular label aggregation method is majority voting, where each item in the dataset is assigned the most common label from the annotators. This approach is optimal when annotators are unbiased domain experts. In this paper, we propose Debiased Label Aggregation (DLA) an alternative method for label aggregation in subjective HITs, where cross-annotator agreement varies. DLA leverages user voting behavior patterns to weight labels. Our experiments show that DLA outperforms majority voting in several performance metrics; e.g. a percentage increase of 20 points in the F1 measure before data augmentation, and a percentage increase of 35 points in the same measure after data augmentation. Since DLA is deceptively simple, we hope it will help researchers to tackle subjective labeling tasks.},

Longer captions require more time to consume, whereas shorter captions may hinder a user’s ability to fully understand the image’s content. We explore how to effectively collect both thumbnail captions—succinct image descriptions meant to be consumed quickly—and comprehensive captions, which allow individuals to understand visual content in greater detail. We consider text-based and time-constrained methods to collect descriptions at these two levels of detail, and find that a time-constrained method is most effective for collecting thumbnail captions while preserving caption accuracy. We evaluate our collected captions along three human-rated axes—correctness, fluency, and level of detail—and discuss the potential for model-based metrics to perform automatic evaluation.},

In order to understand what is being discussed by the microservice community, this work has applied mining techniques and topic modelling to a manually-curated dataset of 1,043 microservice-related posts from StackOverflow. As a result, we found that 13.68\% of microservice technical posts on SO discuss a single technology: Netflix Eureka. Moreover, buzzwords in the microservice ecosystem, e.g., blue/green deployment, were not identified as relevant subjects of discussion on SO. Finally, we show how a high discussion rate on SO may not reflect the popularity of a certain subject within the microservice community.},

publisher = {JMLR.org},
abstract = {Crowdsourcing has emerged as an effective platform for labeling large amounts of data in a cost-and time-efficient manner. Most previous work has focused on designing an efficient algorithm to recover only the ground-truth labels of the data. In this paper, we consider multi-choice crowdsourcing tasks with the goal of recovering not only the ground truth, but also the most confusing answer and the confusion probability. The most confusing answer provides useful information about the task by revealing the most plausible answer other than the ground truth and how plausible it is. To theoretically analyze such scenarios, we propose a model in which there are the top two plausible answers for each task, distinguished from the rest of the choices. Task difficulty is quantified by the probability of confusion between the top two, and worker reliability is quantified by the probability of giving an answer among the top two. Under this model, we propose a two-stage inference algorithm to infer both the top two answers and the confusion probability. We show that our algorithm achieves the minimax optimal convergence rate. We conduct both synthetic and real data experiments and demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms other recent algorithms. We also show the applicability of our algorithms in inferring the difficulty of tasks and in training neural networks with top-two soft labels.},

abstract = {Understanding and assessing the vulnerability of crowdsourcing learning against data poisoning attacks is the key to ensure the quality of classifiers trained from crowdsourced labeled data. Existing studies on data poisoning attacks only focus on exploring the vulnerability of crowdsourced label collection. In fact, instead of the quality of labels themselves, the performance of the trained classifier is a main concern in crowdsourcing learning. Nonetheless, the impact of data poisoning attacks on the final classifiers remains underexplored to date. We aim to bridge this gap. First, we formalize the problem of poisoning attacks, where the objective is to sabotage the trained classifier maximally. Second, we transform the problem into a bilevel min-max optimization problem for the typical learning-from-crowds model and design an efficient adversarial strategy. Extensive validation on real-world datasets demonstrates that our attack can significantly decrease the test accuracy of trained classifiers. We verified that the labels generated with our strategy can be transferred to attack a broad family of crowdsourcing learning models in a black-box setting, indicating its applicability and potential of being extended to the physical world.},

abstract = {With the proliferation of mobile devices, wireless networks and sharing economy, spatial crowdsourcing (e.g., ride hailing, food delivery, citizen sensing services) is becoming popular recently. In spatial crowdsourcing (SC), workers need to physically move to specific locations to conduct the assigned tasks which incurs travel cost. In this paper, we propose a novel SC problem, namely extra budget-aware online task assignment (EBOTA), where tasks have extra budget to subsidize the extra travel cost of workers. EBOTA concerns the strategy of assigning each task to proper worker such that the total satisfaction of completed tasks can be maximized. To address the EBOTA problem, we first propose an efficient algorithm called Deadline-exact algorithm which always computes the optimal assignment for the newly appearing object. Because of Deadline-exact’s high time complexity which may limit its feasibility in real world, we propose another two practical algorithms, i.e., Threshold-based algorithm and Priority-based algorithm. Finally, we verify the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed methods through extensive experiments on real dataset.},

abstract = {Segmentation of histopathological images is an essential task for cancer diagnosis and prognosis in computational pathology. Unfortunately, Machine Learning (ML) techniques need large labeled datasets to train accurate segmentation algorithms that generalize well. A possible solution to alleviate this burden is crowdsourcing, which distributes the effort of labeling among a group of (non-expert) individuals. The bias and noise from less experienced annotators may hamper the performance of machine learning techniques. So far, crowdsourcing approaches in ML leveraging these noisy labels achieve promising results in classification. However, crowdsourcing segmentation is still a challenge in histopathological images. This paper presents a novel crowdsourcing approach to the segmentation of Triple Negative Breast Cancer images. Our method is based on the UNet architecture incorporating a pre-trained ResNet-34 as a backbone. The noisy behavior of the annotators is modeled with a coupled network. Our methodology is validated on a real-world dataset annotated by medical students, where five classes are distinguished. The results show that our method with crowd labels achieves a high level of accuracy in segmentation (DICE: 0.7578), outperforming the well-known STAPLE (DICE: 0.7039) and close to the segmentation model using expert labels (DICE: 0.7723). In conclusion, the initial results of our work suggest that crowdsourcing is a feasible approach to segmentation in histopathological images .},

abstract = {Recently, the concept of metaverse has been rapidly emerging, which highly expands the human living space. Specifically, 3D models are at the heart of building a vast metaverse space, so a massive number of 3D models are needed. Existing 3D model libraries and platforms have achieved great results. However, most of them are unscalable, insufficiently open, inefficient to collect, and at risk of service disruption and data corruption. Therefore, we propose and implement Web3DP, a crowdsourcing platform for 3D models based on Web3 (a.k.a. Web 3.0) infrastructure. By using the decentralized blockchain technology, Web3DP has the advantages of transparency, auditability, traceability, data tamper-proof, high file transfer efficiency, and service stability. Experiments are conducted to validate the performance of the proposed platform. It illustrates that Web3DP shows better file transmission capabilities with an acceptable transaction fee to facilitate 3D model collecting and managing for metaverse, games, cultural heritage, etc.},

abstract = {With the development of sharing economy, multi-platform cooperative matching (MPCM) is becoming popular as it provides an effective way to cope with the supply-demand imbalance in spatial crowdsourcing (SC). While cooperation between two SC platforms in MPCM has been intensively studied, competition among multiple SC platforms is largely overlooked by existing work. In particular, an idle worker may be requested by multiple platforms simultaneously, but he/she can only accept some of them due to capacity constraints. This partial acceptance will decrease the revenue of some platforms and thus should be addressed properly. Towards this goal, we investigate in this paper the problem of acceptance-aware multi-platform cooperative matching. We first design an algorithm called BaseMPCM to predict the acceptance rate of workers and calculate the utility scores of task-and-worker pairs. Considering that in BaseMPCM, the platforms make the decision from their own benefits, and this may lead to a sub-optimal total revenue, we further design an algorithm called DeepMPCM to predict the action of other platforms and calculate the utility scores globally. Extensive experiments on real and synthetic datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithms.},

abstract = {Spatial Crowdsourcing (SC) is ubiquitous in the online world today. As we have transitioned from crowdsourcing applications (e.g., Wikipedia) to SC applications (e.g., Uber), there is a substantial precedent that SC systems have a responsibility not only to effective task assignment but also to privacy protection. To address these often-conflicting responsibilities, we propose a framework, Task Assignment with Federated Preference Learning, which performs task assignment based on worker preferences while keeping the data decentralized and private in each platform center (e.g., each delivery center of an SC company). The framework includes two phases, i.e., a federated preference learning and a task assignment phase. Specifically, in the first phase, we design a local preference model for each platform center based on historical data. Meanwhile, the horizontal federated learning with a client-server structure is introduced to collaboratively train these local preference models under the orchestration of a central server. The task assignment phase aims to achieve effective and efficient task assignment by considering workers' preferences. Extensive evaluations over real data show the effectiveness and efficiency of the paper's proposals.},

abstract = {Backstories provide vital contextual information for information retrieval evaluation. They are useful as textual representations of information needs, for example to aid in relevance judgements as part of test collections for performance evaluation, for studying longer search queries, and for interactive retrieval. While backstories exist for some popular search tasks and domains thanks to evaluation campaigns such as TREC, NTCIR, and CLEF, they are not available for a large range of other tasks and domains. In this paper, we explore crowdsourcing as an approach for obtaining high-quality backstories, with the aim of supporting the development of backstories as key resources for new domains and search tasks. Compared to typical crowdsourcing tasks in the IR domain, such as gathering relevance judgements or short textual search queries, obtaining backstories is more complex. Workers are required to think of information need scenarios and put these thoughts into comparatively lengthy text fragments. This possibly entails a higher cognitive load and longer working time. We describe a crowdsourcing methodology to maximise the usefulness of results, using the creation of backstories for the job search domain as an example. We also present and release a collection of 756 job search backstories, which was obtained via the proposed methodology.},

abstract = {The Deaf and Hard-of-hearing (DHH) community faces a lack of information in American Sign Language (ASL) and other signed languages. Most informational resources are text-based (e.g. books, encyclopedias, newspapers, magazines, etc.). Because DHH signers typically prefer ASL and are often less fluent in written English, text is often insufficient. At the same time, there is also a lack of large continuous sign language datasets from representative signers, which are essential to advancing sign langauge research and technology. In this work, we explore the possibility of crowdsourcing English-to-ASL translations to help address these barriers. To do this, we present a novel bilingual interface that enables the community to both contribute and consume translations. To shed light on the user experience with such an interface, we present a user study with 19 participants using the interface to both generate and consume content. To better understand the potential impact of the interface on translation quality, we also present a preliminary translation quality analysis. Our results suggest that DHH community members find real-world value in the interface, that the quality of translations is comparable to those created with state-of-the-art setups, and shed light on future research avenues.},

However, real-life problems are often complex: they require to collect, organize or transform data, with quality and costs constraints. This work considers dynamic realization policies for complex crowdsourcing tasks. Workflows provide ways to organize a complex task in phases and guide its realization. The challenge is then to deploy a workflow on a crowd, i.e., allocate workers to phases so that the overall workflow terminates, with good accuracy of results and at a reasonable cost. Standard “static” allocation of work in crowdsourcing affects a fixed number of workers per micro-task to realize and aggregates the results. We define new dynamic worker allocation techniques that consider progress in a workflow, quality of synthesized data, and remaining budget. Evaluation on a benchmark shows that dynamic approaches outperform static ones in terms of cost and accuracy.},

abstract = {Crowdsourcing aims to enable the assignment of available resources to the completion of tasks at scale. The continued digitization of societal processes translates into increased opportunities for crowdsourcing. For example, crowdsourcing enables the assignment of computational resources of humans, called workers, to tasks that are notoriously hard for computers. In settings faced with malicious actors, detection of such actors holds the potential to increase the robustness of crowdsourcing platform. We propose a framework called Outlier Detection for Streaming Task Assignment that aims to improve robustness by detecting malicious actors. In particular, we model the arrival of workers and the submission of tasks as evolving time series and provide means of detecting malicious actors by means of outlier detection. We propose a novel socially aware Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) based architecture that is capable of contending with the complex distributions found in time series. The architecture includes two GANs that are designed to adversarially train an autoencoder to learn the patterns of distributions in worker and task time series, thus enabling outlier detection based on reconstruction errors. A GAN structure encompasses a game between a generator and a discriminator, where it is desirable that the two can learn to coordinate towards socially optimal outcomes, while avoiding being exploited by selfish opponents. To this end, we propose a novel training approach that incorporates social awareness into the loss functions of the two GANs. Additionally, to improve task assignment efficiency, we propose an efficient greedy algorithm based on degree reduction that transforms task assignment into a bipartite graph matching. Extensive experiments offer insight into the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed framework.},

abstract = {Label aggregation (LA) is the task of inferring a high-quality label for an example from multiple noisy labels generated by either human annotators or model predictions. Existing work on LA assumes a label generation process and designs a probabilistic graphical model (PGM) to learn latent true labels from observed crowd labels. However, the performance of PGM-based LA models is easily affected by the noise of the crowd labels. As a consequence, the performance of LA models differs on different datasets and no single LA model outperforms the rest on all datasets.We extend PGM-based LA models by integrating a GP prior on the true labels. The advantage of LA models extended with a GP prior is that they can take as input crowd labels, example features, and existing pre-trained label prediction models to infer the true labels, while the original LA can only leverage crowd labels. Experimental results on both synthetic and real datasets show that any LA models extended with a GP prior and a suitable mean function achieves better performance than the underlying LA models, demonstrating the effectiveness of using a GP prior.},

Also, the identity of the task publisher/worker needs to be protected. To address the above issues, we propose a secure task matching scheme in crowdsourcing based on blockchain in this paper. Firstly, we implement multi-publisher/multi-worker task matching in the scheme while protecting task content privacy. Meanwhile, we take advantage of the immutability of the blockchain to ensure the reliability of publishing/matching results.

abstract = {Mobile crowdsourcing has long promised to utilize the power of mobile crowds to reduce the time and monetary cost required to perform large-scale location-dependent tasks, e.g., environmental sensing. Assigning the right tasks to the right users, however, is a longstanding challenge: different users will be better suited for different tasks, which in turn will have different contributions to the overall crowdsourcing goal. Even worse, these relationships are generally unknown a priori and may change over time, particularly in mobile settings. The diversity of devices in the Internet of Things and diversity of new application tasks that they may run exacerbate these challenges. Thus, in this paper, we formulate the mobile crowdsourcing problem as a Contextual Combinatorial Volatile Multi-armed Bandit problem. Although prior work has attempted to learn the optimal user-task assignment based on user-specific side information, such formulations assume known structure in the relationships between contextual information, user suitability for each task, and the overall crowdsourcing goal. To relax these assumptions, we propose a Neural-MAB algorithm that can learn these relationships. We show that in a simulated mobile crowdsourcing application, our algorithm significantly outperforms existing multi-armed bandit baselines in settings with both known and unknown reward structures.},

abstract = {Crowdsourcing is a valuable tool to gather human input which enables the development of reliable artificial intelligence systems. Microtask platforms like Prolific and Amazon’s Mechanical Turk have flourished by creating environments where crowd workers can provide such human input in a diverse and representative manner. Such marketplaces have evolved to support several hundreds of workers in earning their primary livelihood through crowd work. Crowd workers, however, often perform these tasks in sub-optimal work environments with poor ergonomics. Additionally, many of the various microtasks require input via the standard method of a mouse and keyboard and are repetitive in nature. As such, crowd workers who primarily earn their livelihoods in microtask marketplaces are at risk of injuries such as carpal tunnel syndrome. By changing the input modality from a mouse and keyboard to gesture-driven input, crowd workers can complete their work while simultaneously improving or safeguarding their physical health. Through three distinct microtasks, we constructed a dataset that enables the exploration of the physical and mental health of crowd workers while using gestures. In this work, we present the process of constructing this dataset, how we applied it, and the future applications we foresee.},

abstract = {This paper presents a new use case for continuous crowdsourcing, where multiple players collectively control a single character in a video game. Similar approaches have already been proposed, but they suffer from certain limitations: (1) they simply consider static time frames to group real-time inputs from multiple players; (2) then they aggregate inputs with simple majority vote, i.e., each player is uniformly weighted. We present a continuous crowdsourcing multiplayer game equipped with our Crowdsourcing Controller. The Crowdsourcing Controller addresses the above-mentioned limitations: (1) our Dynamic Input Frame approach groups incoming players’ input in real-time by dynamically adjusting the frame length; (2) our Continuous Reliability System estimates players’ skills by assigning them a reliability score, which is later used in a weighted majority vote to aggregate the final output command. We evaluated our Crowdsourcing Controller offline with simulated players and online with real players. Offline and online experiments show that both components of our Crowdsourcing Controller lead to higher game scores, i.e., longer playing time. Moreover, the Crowdsourcing Controller is able to correctly estimate and update players’ reliability scores.},

abstract = {With the development of GPS-enabled smart devices and wireless networks, spatial crowdsourcing has received wide attention in assigning location-sensitive tasks to moving workers. In real-world scenarios, workers may show different preferences in different spatio-temporal contexts for the assigned tasks. It is a challenge to meet the spatio-temporal preferences of workers when assigning tasks. To this end, we propose a novel spatio-temporal preference-aware task assignment framework which consists of a translation-based recommendation phase and a task assignment phase. Specifically, in the first phase, we use a translation-based recommendation model to learn spatio-temporal effects from the workers’ historical task-performing activities and then calculate the spatio-temporal preference scores of workers. In the task assignment phase, we design a basic greedy algorithm and a Kuhn-Munkras (KM)-based algorithm which could achieve a better balance to maximize the total rewards and meet the spatio-temporal preferences of workers. Finally, extensive experiments are conducted, verifying the effectiveness and practicality of the proposed solutions.},

abstract = {Computer-assisted minimally-invasive surgery (MIS) is often based on algorithms that require establishing correspondences between endoscopic images. However, reference annotations frequently required to train or validate a method are extremely difficult to obtain because they are typically made by a medical expert with very limited resources, and publicly available data sets are still far too small to capture the wide range of anatomical/scene variance. Crowdsourcing is a new trend that is based on outsourcing cognitive tasks to many anonymous untrained individuals from an online community. To our knowledge, this paper is the first to investigate the concept of crowdsourcing in the context of endoscopic video image annotation for computer-assisted MIS. According to our study on publicly available in vivo data with manual reference annotations, anonymous non-experts obtain a median annotation error of 2 px (n = 10,000). By applying cluster analysis to multiple annotations per correspondence, this error can be reduced to about 1 px, which is comparable to that obtained by medical experts (n = 500). We conclude that crowdsourcing is a viable method for generating high quality reference correspondences in endoscopic video images.},

abstract = {Understanding the reasons behind the predictions made by deep neural networks is critical for gaining human trust in many important applications, which is reflected in the increasing demand for explainability in AI (XAI) in recent years. Saliency-based feature attribution methods, which highlight important parts of images that contribute to decisions by classifiers, are often used as XAI methods, especially in the field of computer vision. In order to compare various saliency-based XAI methods quantitatively, several approaches for automated evaluation schemes have been proposed; however, there is no guarantee that such automated evaluation metrics correctly evaluate explainability, and a high rating by an automated evaluation scheme does not necessarily mean a high explainability for humans. In this study, instead of the automated evaluation, we propose a new human-based evaluation scheme using crowdsourcing to evaluate XAI methods. Our method is inspired by a human computation game, “Peek-a-boom”, and can efficiently compare different XAI methods by exploiting the power of crowds. We evaluate the saliency maps of various XAI methods on two datasets with automated and crowd-based evaluation schemes. Our experiments show that the result of our crowd-based evaluation scheme is different from those of automated evaluation schemes. In addition, we regard the crowd-based evaluation results as ground truths and provide a quantitative performance measure to compare different automated evaluation schemes. We also discuss the impact of crowd workers on the results and show that the varying ability of crowd workers does not significantly impact the results.},

The HCI community has been increasingly interested in investigating the worker-centric issues inherent in the current model and seeking for potential improvements that could be implemented in the future. This workshop explores how a reimagined perspective on crowdsourcing platforms could provide a more equitable, fair, and rewarding experience. This includes not only the workers but also the platforms, who could benefit e.g. from better processes for worker onboarding, skills-development, and growth. We invite visionary takes in various formats on this topic to spread awareness of worker-centric research and developments to the CHI community. As a result of interactive ideation work in the workshop, we articulate a future direction roadmap for research centred around crowdsourcing platforms. Finally, as a specific interest area, the workshop seeks to study crowdwork from the context of the Global South, which has been arising as an important but critically understudied crowdsourcing market in recent years.},

abstract = {Crowdsourcing consists in hiring workers on internet to perform large amounts of simple, independent and replicated work units, before assembling the returned results. A challenge to solve intricate problems is to define orchestrations of tasks, and allow higher-order answers where workers can suggest a process to obtain data rather than a plain answer. Another challenge is to guarantee that an orchestration with correct input data terminates, and produces correct output data. This work proposes complex workflows, a data-centric model for crowdsourcing based on orchestration of concurrent tasks and higher order schemes. We consider termination (whether some/all runs of a complex workflow terminate) and correctness (whether some/all runs of a workflow terminate with data satisfying FO requirements). We show that existential termination/correctness are undecidable in general excepted for specifications with bounded recursion. However, universal termination/correctness are decidable when constraints on inputs are specified in a decidable fragment of FO, and are at least in .},

abstract = {Crowdsourcing is a new computing paradigm that harnesses human effort to solve computer-hard problems. Budget and quality are two fundamental factors in crowdsourcing, but they are antagonistic and their balance is crucially important. Induction and inference are principled ways for humans to acquire knowledge. Transfer learning can also enable induction and inference processes. When a new task comes, we may not know how to go about approaching it. On the other hand, we may have easy access to relevant knowledge that can help us with the new task. As such, via appropriate knowledge transfer, for example, an improved annotation can be achieved for the task at a small cost. To make this idea concrete, we introduce the Crowdsourcing with Multiple-source Knowledge Transfer (CrowdMKT) approach to transfer knowledge from multiple, similar, but different domains for a new task, and to reduce the negative impact of irrelevant sources. CrowdMKT first learns a set of concentrated highlevel feature vectors of tasks using knowledge transfer from multiple sources, and then introduces a probabilistic graphical model to jointly model the tasks with high-level features, workers, and their annotations. Finally, it adopts an EM algorithm to estimate the workers' strengths and consensus. Experimental results on real-world image and text datasets prove the effectiveness of CrowdMKT in improving the quality and reducing the budget.},

First, this study identified the motivational factors behind participation on a mobile crowdsourcing platform to look for missing children. Next, the study examined the direct and indirect effects of these motivational factors on crowdsourcing participation. Data was collected from 264 respondents from an online survey. Results from structural equation modelling analysis revealed the motivations to volunteer have direct effects while motivations to serve the public have significant indirect effects on mobile crowdsourcing participation.

abstract = {Allocating the most competent crowdworkers to each upcoming task is a fundamental challenge in crowdsourcing. The mechanism becomes complicated when the arriving tasks require a high level of expertise within a constrained budget. The validation of skill matching between tasks and crowdworkers adds a new dimension to the traditional problem of task allocation. In addition, in real-world scenarios, the influx of both tasks and workers is dynamic, making it nearly impossible to predict the precise amount of computational resources required for the crowdsourcing platform to operate efficiently. Serverless computing is a new pay-per-use, auto-scalable, Function-as-a-Service based model, that ensures parallel execution of lightweight event-driven functions. The developer with serverless can solely concentrate on writing application logic with zero effort on resource provision, server management, environmental configuration, and availability. Today, collaboration has become the new competition. In light of these considerations, we propose a novel framework to facilitate task allocation strategies for crowdsourcing applications, deployed within a serverless platform in order to improve performance. The results obtained are compared to the baseline, Online-Greedy, and simulations are run in both serverless and local environments.},

abstract = {Part of the design of many blockchains and cryptocurrencies includes a treasury, which periodically allocates collected funds to various projects that could be beneficial to their ecosystem. These projects are then voted on and selected by the users of the respective cryptocurrency. To better inform the users' choices, the proposals can be reviewed, in distributed fashion. Motivated by these intricacies, we study the problem of crowdsourcing reviews for different proposals, in parallel. During the reviewing phase, every reviewer can select the proposals to write reviews for, as well as the quality of each review. The quality levels follow certain very coarse community guidelines (since the review of the reviews has to be robust enough, even though it is also crowdsourced) and can have values such as 'excellent' or 'good'. Based on these scores and the distribution of reviews, every reviewer will receive some reward for their efforts. In this paper, we consider a simple and intuitive reward scheme and show that it always has pure Nash equilibria, under two different scenarios. In addition, we show that these equilibria guarantee constant factor approximations for two natural metrics: the total quality of all reviews, as well as the fraction of proposals that received at least one review, compared to the optimal outcome.},

abstract = {The past decade has witnessed rapid development of wireless communication and ubiquitous availability of mobile devices. Spatial crowdsourcing (SC), which requires workers to physically move to specific locations to perform tasks, has gained unprecedented popularity. A typical class of SC tasks is macro tasks, which demand the cooperation of multiple workers with specific skills. Existing studies on macro task assignment often generate an assignment strategy where worker skill set can fully cover the required skills, leading to ambiguous division of labor among workers and unreasonable static distribution of rewards. This work studies the explicit assignment and dynamic pricing (EADP) problem of macro tasks, and considers both online explicit task assignment (skill used and realtime workload) and dynamic reward distribution. Aiming to maximize social welfare of the SC system, we develop a pricing mechanism based on primal-dual technique, and propose an online batch-based framework coupled with an effective dual subroutine to assign macro SC tasks. Through theoretical analysis, we prove that the pricing mechanism is truthful and individually rational, and our online framework guarantees a good parameterized competitive ratio, as well as polynomial time complexity. Extensive experiments demonstrate our algorithms’ effectiveness and efficiency.},

abstract = {Waste bank management is one of the efforts to reduce waste piles, prevent environmental pollution, and function as a socio-economic community. This effort is in line with the concern of the United Nations in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals, especially Goal 11 (Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable). However, the lack of community participation in waste bank activities is an obstacle to managing waste banks. One of the reasons they have yet to become participants or customers of Waste Bank is that it takes a long time to collect their waste until it is ready to be deposited into the waste bank. Based on these problems, we propose a crowdsourcing mobile application design solution for community participation in waste management. It can be a solution to involve the community in waste bank activities, one of which is collecting waste together (crowdsourcing) so that waste can be collected more quickly and reporting locations where there are landfills. The design of this application's user interface uses the design thinking method and produces nine design solution features in the form of an interactive prototype named Klik Sampah. Usability Testing of the Klik Sampah application prototype was carried out based on ISO 9241-11 and obtained a score of 89.84\%, which is included in category A (Excellent). This study also shows that user preferences for the Klik Sampah application design solution depend on the habits and amount of waste collected by each user. If the amount of waste collected is too small, users prefer to collaborate with other users to collect more waste, deposit it in the Waste Bank, and get more rewards.},

abstract = {When selecting workers in microtask crowdsourcing platforms, a common practice of requesters is to select qualified workers by looking at the evaluation results for the tasks in the past or by conducting qualifying tests for the tasks. This sometimes misses workers who may be able to complete some of the tasks. Increasing working opportunities for such workers has advantages not only for the workers but also for requesters because they obtain labor resources for faster completion of tasks. However, in general, an increase in the working opportunity and obtaining high-quality task results is a trade-off; if they choose workers whose skill levels are above a lower threshold to increase the number of workers, the quality of the task will be undermined. In this paper, we address the problem of improving the trade-off in labor-intensive crowdsourcing by exploring different task assignment strategies. For that purpose, we apply Item Response Theory to evaluate the skills of workers and the difficulty of tasks and devise an algorithm for assigning tasks in such a way that the variance in the number of tasks assigned among workers is minimized trying to take advantage of the potential parallelism of crowdsourcing. Second, we address the problem that the difficulty of the tasks is unknown in advance. We explore an approach that uses ML outputs for difficulty estimation. This paper reports on our experimental result, which shows the potential of this approach, and discusses when this approach is effective.},

abstract = {Quality control is an, if not the, essential challenge in crowdsourcing. Unsatisfactory responses from crowd workers have been found to particularly result from ambiguous and incomplete task descriptions, often from inexperienced task requesters. However, creating clear task descriptions with sufficient information is a complex process for requesters in crowdsourcing marketplaces. In this paper, we investigate the extent to which requesters can be supported effectively in this process through computational techniques. To this end, we developed a tool that enables requesters to iteratively identify and correct eight common clarity flaws in their task descriptions before deployment on the platform. The tool can be used to write task descriptions from scratch or to assess and improve the clarity of prepared descriptions. It employs machine learning-based natural language processing models trained on real-world task descriptions that score a given task description for the eight clarity flaws. On this basis, the requester can iteratively revise and reassess the task description until it reaches a sufficient level of clarity. In a first user study, we let requesters create task descriptions using the tool and rate the tool’s different aspects of helpfulness thereafter. We then carried out a second user study with crowd workers, as those who are confronted with such descriptions in practice, to rate the clarity of the created task descriptions. According to our results, 65\% of the requesters classified the helpfulness of the information provided by the tool high or very high (only 12\% as low or very low). The requesters saw some room for improvement though, for example, concerning the display of bad examples. Nevertheless, 76\% of the crowd workers believe that the overall clarity of the task descriptions created by the requesters using the tool improves over the initial version. In line with this, the automatically-computed clarity scores of the edited task descriptions were generally higher than those of the initial descriptions, indicating that the tool reliably predicts the clarity of task descriptions in overall terms.},

abstract = {Recent years have witnessed a revolution in Spatial Crowdsourcing (SC), in which people with mobile connectivity can perform spatio-temporal tasks that involve travel to specified locations. In this paper, we identify and study in depth a new multi-center-based task allocation problem in the context of SC, where multiple allocation centers exist. In particular, we aim to maximize the total number of the allocated tasks while minimizing the average allocated task number difference. To solve the problem, we propose a two-phase framework, called Task Allocation with Geographic Partition, consisting of a geographic partition phase and a task allocation phase. The first phase is to divide the whole study area based on the allocation centers by using both a basic Voronoi diagram-based algorithm and an adaptive weighted Voronoi diagram-based algorithm. In the allocation phase, we utilize a Reinforcement Learning method to achieve the task allocation, where a graph neural network with the attention mechanism is used to learn the embeddings of allocation centers, delivery points and workers. Extensive experiments give insight into the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed solutions.},

abstract = {With the popularity of wireless network and mobile devices, spatial crowdsourcing has gained much attention from both academia and industry. One of the critical components in spatial crowdsourcing is task-worker matching, where workers are assigned to tasks to meet some pre-defined objectives. Previous works generally assume that the locations of tasks are known in advance. However, this does not always hold, since in many real world applications where to put tasks is not specific and needs to be determined on the fly. In this paper, we propose Incentive-aware Task Location (ITL), a novel problem in spatial crowdsourcing. Given a location-unspecific task with a fixed budget, the ITL problem seeks multiple locations to place the task and allocates the given budget to each location, such that the number of workers who are willing to participate the task is maximized. We prove that the ITL problem is NP-hard and propose three heuristic methods to solve it, including even clustering, uneven clustering and greedy location methods. Through extensive experiments on a real dataset, we demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed methods.},

Two crowdsourcing campaigns have been carried out. For the first one, the user could be imprecise in his answer, for the second one he had to be precise. For both experiments, the user had to indicate his certainty in his answer. The results show that by being imprecise, users are more certain of their answers.},

abstract = {With the rapid popularization of mobile devices, the mobile crowdsourcing has become a hot topic in order to make full use of the resources of mobile devices. To achieve this goal, it is necessary to design an excellent incentive mechanism to encourage more mobile users to actively undertake crowdsourcing tasks, so as to achieve maximization of certain economic indicators. However, most of the reported incentive mechanisms in the existing literature adopt a centralized platform, which collects the bidding information from workers and task requesters. There is a risk of privacy exposure. In this paper, we design a decentralized auction framework where mobile workers are sellers and task requesters are buyers. This requires each participant to make its own local and independent decision, thereby avoiding centralized processing of task allocation and pricing. Both of them aim to maximize their utilities under the budget constraint. We theoretically prove that our proposed framework is individual rational, budget balanced, truthful, and computationally efficient, and then we conduct a group of numerical simulations to demonstrate its correctness and effectiveness.},

abstract = {Evaluating the effectiveness of defense technologies mandates the inclusion of a human element, specifically if these technologies target human cognition and emotions. One of the biggest challenges that face researchers in the realm of behavioral cybersecurity is participant recruitment. Researchers often rely on college students, the general public, real-world hackers, or a hard-to-reach population (e.g., professional red teamers) to test the effectiveness of cybersecurity defense techniques. However, recruiting participants from these populations has drawbacks, including but not limited to: high cost, time constraints, and manageability and accessibility issues. This research explored the applicability of using two popular crowdsourcing platforms, Amazon Mechanical Turk and Prolific, to conduct web hacking experiments. Our study is the first to use crowdsourcing platforms to run hacking experiments for scientific purposes. While the recruitment is challenging, the paradigm of existing crowdsourcing platforms can be useful for understanding adversarial behavior, as it facilitates access to a diverse set of participants and allows researchers to conduct longitudinal and cross-cultural assessments. In particular, crowdsourcing platforms offer a great opportunity for cybersecurity researchers to investigate the Oppositional Human Factors (OHFs) in a manageable and flexible way.},

abstract = {Software crowdsourcing platforms allow for wide task accessibility and self-selection, which require participants to interact with a wide range of task options. This increased accessibility enables crowd workers to freely choose tasks based on their skills, experience and interests. However, the inconsistencies in crowd workers’ comprehension and interpretation of the designs of different tasks and the platform interaction strategies may introduce task uncertainty into the selection process. This may result in low performance, which can diminish the quality of the crowdsourcing platform. Previous studies show that the quality of the outcome of these systems depends on different design parameters in both social and technical contexts. Therefore, through the lens of Socio-Technical Systems, our experimental study quantifies and compares 30 participants’ behavior and performance throughout their interaction and selection of different software tasks via an online-based tool named “SoftCrowd,” using different design strategies and task features. Results showed a significant relationship between task submission rate and platform design, including interaction strategies, task ambiguity and task instruction design. These findings suggest that our proposed design factors may have unanticipated effects on the quality of crowdsourcing, calling for more studies of crowdsourcing design to inform better strategies for various aspects of platform design.},

abstract = {Crowdsourcing has the potential to solve complex problems, especially tasks that are easy for humans but difficult for computers. Service providers of emerging crowdsourcing platforms hope that crowdsourcing tasks on their service platforms can be executed as much as possible in available time. We consider from the perspective of the crowdsourcing service platform and study how to rank tasks to minimize the maximum timeout of tasks. We first formalize the Task Ranking Optimization Problem (TROP) and study its offline version. In the case of online scenario, we propose an Iterative Hungarian Algorithm for Task Ranking Optimization Problem, considering task deadline and click transfer rate with ranking amplification. Experiments on a real crowdsourcing service platform and the simulations based on real datasets demonstrate the superiority of proposed algorithm.},

abstract = {Crowdsourcing has emerged as an effective means for performing a number of machine learning tasks such as annotation and labelling of images and other data sets. In most early settings of crowdsourcing, the task involved classification, that is assigning one of a discrete set of labels to each task. Recently, however, more complex tasks have been attempted including asking crowdsource workers to assign continuous labels, or predictions. In essence, this involves the use of crowdsourcing for function estimation. We are motivated by this problem to drive applications such as collaborative prediction, that is, harnessing the wisdom of the crowd to predict quantities more accurately. To do so, we propose a Bayesian approach aimed specifically at alleviating overfitting, a typical impediment to accurate prediction models in practice. In particular, we develop a variational Bayesian technique for two different worker noise models - one that assumes workers’ noises are independent and the other that assumes workers’ noises have a latent low-rank structure. Our evaluations on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that these Bayesian approaches perform significantly better than existing non-Bayesian approaches and are thus potentially useful for this class of crowdsourcing problems.},

abstract = {Case study-based learning has been successfully integrated into various courses, including software engineering education. In the context of software design courses, the use of case studies often entails sharing of real successful or failed software development. Using examples of real-world case studies allows educators to reinforce the applicability and usefulness of fundamental design concepts, relate the importance of evaluating design trade-offs with respect to stakeholders' requirements, and highlight the importance of upfront design where students that lack industrial experience tend to overlook. However, the use of real-world case studies is not straightforward because 1.) there is a lack of open source repositories for real software design case studies and 2.) even if case studies are available, they are often reported without a standardized format, which may hinder the alignment between the case and the desired learning outcomes. To address the lack of software design case studies for educational purposes, we propose the idea of Open Design Case Study, a repository to crowdsource, curate, and recruit other educators to contribute case studies for teaching software design courses. The platform will also allow educators and students to share, brainstorm, and discuss design solutions based on case studies shared publicly on the repository.},

abstract = {The increasing popularity of mobile crowdsourcing platforms has enabled crowd workers to accept jobs wherever/whenever they are, and also provides opportunity for task requesters to order time/location specific tasks to workers. Since workers on mobile platforms are working on the go, the situation of the workers is expected to influence their performance. However, the effects of mobile worker situations to task performance is an uninvestigated area. In this paper, our research question is, "do worker situations affect task completion, price and quality on mobile crowdsourcing platforms?" We draw on economics and psychology research to examine whether worker situations such as busyness, fatigue and presence of companions affect their performance. Our three-week between-subjects field experiment revealed that worker busyness caused 30.1\% relative decrease of task completion rate. Mean accepted task price increased by 7.6\% when workers are with companions. Worker fatigue caused 37.4\% relative decrease of task quality.},

abstract = {With the prevalence of sharing economy and mobile Internet, spatial crowdsourcing (SC) has been receiving increased attentions recently. A core issue in SC is task assignment, which aims to assign tasks to suitable workers. As workers need to reach the corresponding locations to complete the tasks, they prefer tasks nearby to save travel cost. Therefore, most of the existing solutions for task assignment give workers a fixed range constraint. However, those solutions do not consider the tasks that out of the range, which may make these remote tasks never been completed. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a new problem called extra-budget aware task assignment (EBATA) in spatial crowdsourcing, where extra budget is provided to subsidize the over cost of workers to ensure that the remote tasks have a chance to be accomplished. To address the EBATA problem, two baseline algorithms and two improved greedy algorithms are devised in the paper. The two improved greedy algorithms can heavily reduce the computational time and keep most of the number of matched pairs with the optimal one. Extensive experiments on real dataset verify the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed methods.},

These platforms offer alternative forms of public services by creating social and public innovation through cross-sectoral collaboration. Out of various types of platforms, crowdsourcing platforms pool and aggregate resources from the public to generate more creative solutions. This paper examines seven different crowdsourcing platforms in the public sector and demonstrates how they can promote and facilitate collaboration, creating bridges between diverse actors. The paper also discusses the barriers that have hampered the growth of these digital platforms in public projects in the past.

abstract = {The development of crowdsourcing software is commonly organized around platforms that allow a requester to submit a task and connect it with a crowd of individuals, who will provide likely solutions to the task. However, these platforms often ignore factors that provide a satisfactory user experience, reflecting, among others, the abandonment of tasks. To this end, it is essential to identify and understand User Experiences (UX) on platforms, assist in the improvement/development of these environments, and minimize barriers imposed by unsatisfactory experiences problems. This paper aimed to investigate long-term UX on a crowdsourcing platform. It is a qualitative exploratory study, carried out from a quasi-experiment, in which 10 undergraduate students selected for convenience participated. Participants performed tasks on the TopCoder platform over 3 months and answered the online questionnaire. Throughout the period, participants reported their experiences with the platform, describing their impressions about the use. The results showed the most satisfactory experiences occurred mainly in the last weeks of study and were mainly associated with the completion and task submission. For less satisfactory experiences, the main reasons identified were mainly associated with the difficulty of use and low usability. All participants informed that they would recommend the platform to others. It is concluded that, even with usability problems, the user's experience when using the platform was satisfactory. The results can be used to suggest mechanisms that reduce the barriers imposed by problems of less satisfactory experiences, spreading the crowdsourcing software and, consequently, expanding its adoption in the software development industry.},

Also, it is usually challenging to predict cooperative behavior between independent contractors via a static network. The contribution of this paper is two-fold. First, we provide a crowd collaboration incentive system under full pay transparency on a temporal scale. Second, we predict a strong cooperation relationship between independent contractors via inductive presentation learning of temporal networks. Our findings suggest that 1) strong cooperation relationships exist widely in collaboration networks, which can help distribution, efficiency incentive, and workload intervention, and 2) strong cooperation relationships can be operationalized and predicted via computational methods.},

An example of such a task is fact-checking, that asks workers to check whether the shown claim is true or not. Fact-checking tasks are used in many applications such as services to identify fake news. This context motivates us to investigate a crowdsourcing-based framework to find convincing proofs for fact-checking. This study investigates a good crowdsourcing strategy to obtain convincing proofs with evidence. We focus on an iterative workflow in which workers improve the proofs provided by other crowd workers. In this study, we show the results of our experiment, in which we compare the results of two conditions, by which we see the effects of the diversification of shown evidence and proofs. The experimental results with real-world workers show that showing diverse evidence and proofs to crowd workers in the iterative workflow helps them develop more convincing proofs.},

This can be attributed to the fact that in many traditional educational systems, students are primarily involved in just answering assessment items. In recent years, the use of crowdsourcing to support learning at scale has received significant attention. In crowdsourcing educational systems, in addition to attempting assessment items, students are engaged with other various tasks such as creating resources, creating solutions, rating the quality of resources, and giving feedback. Past studies have demonstrated that engaging students in meaningful crowdsourcing tasks, also referred to as learningsourcing, has pedagogical benefits that can enhance student learning. In this paper, we present a learner model that leverages data from students’ learnersourcing contributions alongside attempting assessment items towards modelling of students’ knowledge state. Results from an empirical study suggest that indeed crowdsourced contributions from students can effectively be used in modelling learners.},

Researchers introduce Peer-Based Mechanisms (PBMs) in crowdsourcing settings to incentivize agents to report accurately. We observe that with PBMs, crowdsourcing systems may not be fair. Unfair rewards for the agents may discourage participation. This work aims to build a general framework that assures fairness for PBMs in a temporal setting, i.e., where reports are time-sensitive. Towards this, we introduce two notions of fairness for PBMs, namely γ-fairness and qualitative fairness. To satisfy these notions, our framework provides trustworthy agents with additional chances of pairing. We introduce Temporal Reputation Model (TERM) to quantify agents' trustworthiness across tasks. Having TERM, we present our iterative framework, REFORM, that can adopt the reward scheme of any existing PBM. We demonstrate REFORM's significance by deploying the framework with RPTSC's reward scheme and prove that REFORM with RPTSC considerably improves fairness; while incentivizing truthful and early reports.},

abstract = {Nonprofit crowdsourcing platforms such as food recovery organizations rely on volunteers to perform time-sensitive tasks. Thus, their success crucially depends on efficient volunteer utilization and engagement. To encourage volunteers to complete a task, platforms use nudging mechanisms to notify a subset of volunteers with the hope that at least one of them responds positively. However, since excessive notifications may reduce volunteer engagement, the platform faces a trade-off between notifying more volunteers for the current task and saving them for future ones. Motivated by these applications, we introduce the online volunteer notification problem, a generalization of online stochastic bipartite matching where tasks arrive following a known time-varying distribution over task types. Upon arrival of a task, the platform notifies a subset of volunteers with the objective of minimizing the number of missed tasks. To capture each volunteer's adverse reaction to excessive notifications, we assume that a notification triggers a random period of inactivity, during which she will ignore all notifications. However, if a volunteer is active and notified, she will perform the task with a given pair-specific match probability that captures her preference for the task. We develop two online randomized policies that achieve constant-factor guarantees which are close to the upper-bounds we establish for the performance of any online policy. Our policies as well as hardness results are parameterized by the minimum discrete hazard rate of the inter-activity time distribution. The design of our policies relies on two modifications of an ex-ante feasible solution: (1) properly scaling down the notification probability prescribed by the ex-ante solution, and (2) sparsifying that solution. Further, in collaboration with Food Rescue U.S., a volunteer-based food recovery platform, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our policies by testing them on the platform's data from various locations across the U.S.},

abstract = {The pervasiveness of GPS-enabled devices and wireless communication technologies flourish the market of Spatial Crowdsourcing (SC), which consists of location-based tasks and requires workers to physically be at specific locations to complete them. In this work, we study the problem of Worker Churn based Task Assignment in SC, where tasks are to be assigned by considering workers' churn. In particular, we aim to achieve the highest total rewards of task assignments based on the worker churn prediction. To solve the problem, we propose a two-phase framework, which consists of a worker churn prediction phase and a task assignment phase. In the first phase, we use an LSTM-based model to extract the latent feelings of workers based on the historical data and then estimate the idle time intervals of workers. In the assignment phase, we design an efficient greedy algorithm and a Kuhn-Munkras (KM)-based algorithm that can achieve the optimal task assignment. Extensive experiments offer insight into the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed solutions.},

abstract = {Crowdsourcing has been a successful paradigm in organising a large number of actors to work on specific tasks and contribute to knowledge collectively. However, the openness of such systems allows destructive patterns to form through actors’ dynamics. As a result, the collective effort of actors may not achieve the targeted objective due to lower engagement and lower quality contributions. There are varying forms of actor dynamics that can lead to suboptimal outcomes and this paper provides a systematic analysis of these in the form of a collection of patterns, derived from both the literature and from our own experiences with crowdsourcing systems. This collection of so-called co-destruction patterns allows for an-depth analysis of corwdsourcing systems which can benefit a comparative analysis and also assist with improvements of existing systems or the set-up of new ones. A survey reveals that these patterns have been observed in practice and are perceived as worthwhile addressing.},

abstract = {Task-oriented bots (or simply bots) enable humans to perform tasks in natural language. For example, to book a restaurant or check the weather. Crowdsourcing has become a prominent approach to build datasets for training and evaluating task-oriented bots, where the crowd grows an initial seed of utterances through paraphrasing, i.e., reformulating a given seed into semantically equivalent sentences. In this context, the resulting diversity is a relevant dimension of high-quality datasets, as diverse paraphrases capture the many ways users may express an intent. Current techniques, however, are either based on the assumption that crowd-powered paraphrases are naturally diverse or focus only on lexical diversity. In this paper, we address an overlooked aspect of diversity and introduce an approach for guiding the crowdsourcing process towards paraphrases that are syntactically diverse. We introduce a workflow and novel prompts that are informed by syntax patterns to elicit paraphrases avoiding or incorporating desired syntax. Our empirical analysis indicates that our approach yields higher syntactic diversity, syntactic novelty and more uniform pattern distribution than state-of-the-art baselines, albeit incurring on higher task effort.},

abstract = {Crowdsourcing enables a paradigm to conduct the manual annotation and the analytics by those recruited workers, with their rewards relevant to the quality of the results. Existing dispatchers fail to capture the resource-quality trade-off for video analytics, since the configurations supported by various workers are different, and the workers’ availability is essentially dynamic. To determine the most suitable configurations as well as workers for video analytics, we formulate a non-linear mixed program in a long-term scope, maximizing the profit for the crowdsourcing platform. Based on previous results under various configurations and workers, we design an algorithm via a series of subproblems to decide the configurations adaptively upon the prediction of the worker rewards. Such prediction is based on volatile multi-armed bandit to capture the workers’ availability and stochastic changes on resource uses. Via rigorous proof, the regret is ensured upon the Lyapunov optimization and the bandit, measuring the gap between the online decisions and the offline optimum. Extensive trace-driven experiments show that our algorithm improves the platform profit by 37\%, compared with other algorithms.},

abstract = {The demand for large-scale diverse datasets is rapidly increasing due to the advancements in AI services impacting day-to-day life. However, gathering such massive datasets still remains a critical challenge in the AI service engineering pipeline, especially in the computer vision domain where labeled data is scarce. Rather than isolated data collection, crowdsourcing techniques have shown promising potential to achieve the data collection task in a time and cost-efficient manner. In the existing crowdsourcing marketplaces, the crowd works to fulfill consumer-defined requirements where in the end consumer gains the data ownership and the crowd is compensated with task-based payment. On the contrary, this work proposes a blockchain-based decentralized marketplace named Vision Sovereignty Data Marketplace (ViSDM), in which the crowd works to fulfill global requirements \&amp; holds data ownership, the consumers pay a certain data price to perform a computing task (model training/testing), the data price is distributed among the crowd in a one-to-many manner through smart contracts, thus allowing the crowd to gain profit from each consumer transaction occurring on their data. The marketplace is implemented as multiple smart contracts and is evaluated based on blockchain-transaction gas fees for the stakeholder interaction \&amp; by running scenarios-based simulations. Furthermore, discussions address the challenges included in maintaining data quality and the future milestones towards deployment.},

abstract = {Mobile crowdsourcing services (MCS), enable fast and economical data acquisition at scale and find applications in a variety of domains. Prior work has shown that Foursquare and Waze (a location-based and a navigation MCS) are vulnerable to different kinds of data poisoning attacks. Such attacks can be upsetting and even dangerous especially when they are used to inject improper inputs to mislead users. However, to date, there is no comprehensive study on the extent of improper input validation (IIV) vulnerabilities and the feasibility of their exploits in MCSs across domains. In this work, we leverage the fact that MCS interface with their participants through mobile apps to design tools and new methodologies embodied in an end-to-end feedback-driven analysis framework which we use to study 10 popular and previously unexplored services in five different domains. Using our framework we send tens of thousands of API requests with automatically generated input values to characterize their IIV attack surface. Alarmingly, we found that most of them (8/10) suffer from grave IIV vulnerabilities which allow an adversary to launch data poisoning attacks at scale: 7400 spoofed API requests were successful in faking online posts for robberies, gunshots, and other dangerous incidents, faking fitness activities with supernatural speeds and distances among many others. Lastly, we discuss easy to implement and deploy mitigation strategies which can greatly reduce the IIV attack surface and argue for their use as a necessary complementary measure working toward trustworthy mobile crowdsourcing services.},

abstract = {With the continued increased use of the Internet and mobile devices, the study of how people interact with each other is more relevant than ever. This development in communication has introduced a new question of how this can lead to a collective effort controlled by the masses. This collectivist system has been coined crowdsourcing. This study is a systematic literature review that aims to find emerging trends within the topic of crowdsourcing. This review was done using tools such as Harzing’s Publish or Perish, Scopus, MAXQDA, Vicinitas, and VosViewer, and CiteSpace. Bibliometric analyses were done using these tools to show the emergence of crowdsourcing and in what ways researchers and the public are interested in the topic. These results are visualized using maps and word clouds. The results of the analysis showed an interest in potentially using crowdsourcing in the healthcare and transportation industries. Also, these results showed the emergence of new subtopics such as disaster preparedness and job recruitment techniques. It is imperative to learn how these potential avenues for crowdsourcing can be utilized and how it will uniquely affect each industry and its current job design. These findings are highlighted in the literature review and subsequent discussion.},

abstract = {Existing schemes cannot assign complex tasks to the most suitable workers because they either cannot measure skills quantitatively or do not consider assigning tasks to workers who are the most suitable but unavailable temporarily. In this paper, we investigate how to realize optimal complex task assignment. Firstly, we formulate the multiple-skill-based task assignment problem in service crowdsourcing. We then propose a weighted multiskill tree (WMST) to model multiple skills and their correlations. Next, we propose the acceptance expectation to uniformly measure the probabilities that different categories of workers will accept and complete specified tasks. Finally, we propose an acceptance-expectation-based task assignment (AE-TA) algorithm, which reserves tasks for the most suitable workers even unavailable temporarily. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that our WMST model and AE-TA algorithm significantly outperform related proposals.},

abstract = {Crowdsourcing is becoming essential to facilitate disaster management. It can help to gather or check information and delegate collective physical tasks (alerting, rescuing, sheltering, food distribution…) to volunteers. In this context, the management of volunteers, with possible uncertain behavior, cannot be improvised, for both security and efficiency reasons. Therefore, it is necessary to provide officials with tools to anticipate and prepare coordination with volunteers. For that purpose, this paper proposes a geospatial agent-based simulator to visualize, measure and analyze the influence of crowdsourcing in natural disasters management. More precisely, this tool allows the authorities to visualize a crisis situation (actors, environment) and its evolution throughout time and space, improve their situation awareness and explore several what-if scenarios so as to ease coordination with official responders. Moreover, task assignment is implemented according to the contract net protocol to select the volunteers according to their variable characteristics: availabilities, positions, skills… This paper describes the design and implementation of this simulator, which is based on a conceptual model representing the environment, agents’ behaviors and their interactions. We also demonstrate its use through a real-world case study based on a flood that took place in 2018 in Tr\`{e}bes, a French town. We demonstrate with quantitative indicators the positive impacts of crowdsourcing on this crisis management. This simulator could be easily reused for other natural disaster situations.},

abstract = {Algorithms are used to aid decision-making for a wide range of public policy decisions. Yet, the details of the algorithmic processes and how to interact with their systems are often inadequately communicated to stakeholders, leaving them frustrated and distrusting of the outcomes of the decisions. Transparency and accountability are critical prerequisites for building trust in the results of decisions and guaranteeing fair and equitable outcomes. Unfortunately, organizations and agencies do not have strong incentives to explain and clarify their decision processes; however, stakeholders are not powerless and can strategically combine their efforts to push for more transparency. In this paper, I discuss the results and lessons learned from such an effort: a parent-led crowdsourcing campaign to increase transparency in the New York City school admission process. NYC famously uses a deferred-acceptance matching algorithm to assign students to schools, but families are given very little, and often wrong, information on the mechanisms of the system in which they have to participate. Furthermore, the odds of matching to specific schools depend on a complex set of priority rules and tie-breaking random (lottery) numbers, whose impact on the outcome is not made clear to students and their families, resulting in many “wasted choices” on students’ ranked lists and a high rate of unmatched students. Using the results of a crowdsourced survey of school application results, I was able to explain how random tie-breakers factored in the admission, adding clarity and transparency to the process. The results highlighted several issues and inefficiencies in the match and made the case for the need for more accountability and verification in the system.},

Existing methods for evaluating multiple-choice questions in educational contexts tend to focus primarily on machine readability metrics, such as grammar, syntax, and formatting, without considering the intended use of the questions within course materials and their pedagogical implications. In this study, we present the results of crowdsourcing the evaluation of multiple-choice questions based on 15 common item-writing flaws. Through analysis of 80 crowdsourced evaluations on questions from the domains of calculus and chemistry, we found that crowdworkers were able to accurately evaluate the questions, matching 75\% of the expert evaluations across multiple questions. They were able to correctly distinguish between two levels of Bloom's Taxonomy for the calculus questions, but were less accurate for chemistry questions. We discuss how to scale this question evaluation process and the implications it has across other domains. This work demonstrates how crowdworkers can be leveraged in the quality evaluation of educational questions, regardless of prior experience or domain knowledge.},

abstract = {Crowdsourcing has been leveraged in various tasks and applications, primarily to gather information from human annotators in exchange for a monetary reward. The main challenge associated with crowdsourcing is the low quality of the results, which can stem from multiple reasons, including bias, error, and adversarial behavior. Researchers and practitioners can apply quality control methods to prevent and detect low-quality responses. For example, worker selection methods utilize qualifications and attention check questions before assigning a task. Similarly, task routing identifies the workers who can provide a more accurate response to a given task type using recommender system techniques. In practice, posterior quality control methods are the most common approach to deal with noisy labels once they are obtained. Such methods require task repetition, i.e., assigning the task to multiple crowd-workers, followed by an aggregation mechanism (aka truth inference) to select the most likely answer or request an additional label. A large number of techniques have been proposed for crowdsourcing aggregation covering several types of task types. This tutorial aims to present common and recent label aggregation techniques for multiple-choice questions, multi-class labels, ratings, pairwise comparison, and image/text annotation. We believe that the audience will benefit from the focus on this specific research area to learn about the best techniques to apply in their crowdsourcing projects.},

abstract = {A key challenge of big data analytics is how to collect a large volume of (labeled) data. Crowdsourcing aims to address this challenge via aggregating and estimating high-quality data (e.g., sentiment label for text) from pervasive clients/users. Existing studies on crowdsourcing focus on designing new methods to improve the aggregated data quality from unreliable/noisy clients. However, the security aspects of such crowdsourcing systems remain under-explored to date. We aim to bridge this gap in this work. Specifically, we show that crowdsourcing is vulnerable to data poisoning attacks, in which malicious clients provide carefully crafted data to corrupt the aggregated data. We formulate our proposed data poisoning attacks as an optimization problem that maximizes the error of the aggregated data. Our evaluation results on one synthetic and two real-world benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed attacks can substantially increase the estimation errors of the aggregated data. We also propose two defenses to reduce the impact of malicious clients. Our empirical results show that the proposed defenses can substantially reduce the estimation errors of the data poisoning attacks.},

abstract = {Research involving Virtual Reality (VR) headsets is becoming more and more popular. However, scaling VR experiments is challenging as researchers are often limited to using one or a small number of headsets for in-lab studies. One general way to scale experiments is through crowdsourcing so as to have access to a large pool of diverse participants with relatively little expense of time and money. Unfortunately, there is no easy way to crowdsource VR experiments. We demonstrate that it is possible to implement and run crowdsourced VR experiments using a pre-existing massively multiplayer online VR social platform - VRChat. Our small (n=10) demonstration experiment required participants to navigate a maze in VR. Participants searched for two targets then returned to the exit while we captured completion time and position over time. While there are some limitations with using VRChat, overall we have demonstrated a promising approach for running crowdsourced VR experiments.},

abstract = {It has been recently proposed to consider relevance assessment as a stochastic process where relevance judgements are modeled as binomial random variables and, consequently, evaluation measures become random evaluation measures, removing the distinction between binary and multi-graded evaluation measures.In this paper, we adopt this stochastic view of relevance judgments and we investigate how this can be applied in the crowd-sourcing context. In particular, we show that injecting some randomness in the judgments by crowd assessors improves their correlation with the gold standard and we introduce a new merging approach, based on binomial random variables, which is competitive with respect to state-of-the-art at low numbers of merged assessors.},

Data includes non-emotional recordings from each subject as well as recordings for five emotions: angry, happy-low-arousal, happy-high-arousal, neutral, and sad. The data consist of spontaneous speech elicited from subjects via a web-based tool. Subjects used their own personal recording equipment, resulting in a data set that contains variation in room acoustics, microphone, etc. This offers the advantage of matching the type of variation one would expect to see when exposing speech technology in the wild in a web-based environment. The annotation scheme covers the quality of emotion expressed through the tone of voice and what was said, along with common audio-quality issues. We discuss lessons learned in the process of the creation of this corpus.},

abstract = {We study a crowdsourcing problem where the platform aims to incentivize distributed workers to provide high-quality and truthful solutions without the ability to verify the solutions. While most prior work assumes that the platform and workers have symmetric information, we study an asymmetric information scenario where the platform has informational advantages. Specifically, the platform knows more information regarding workers’ average solution accuracy, and can strategically reveal such information to workers. Workers will utilize the announced information to determine the likelihood that they obtain a reward if exerting effort on the task. We study two types of workers: (1) naive workers who fully trust the announcement, and (2) strategic workers who update prior belief based on the announcement. For naive workers, we show that the platform should always announce a high average accuracy to maximize its payoff. However, this is not always optimal for strategic workers, as it may reduce the credibility of the platform’s announcement and hence reduce the platform’s payoff. Interestingly, the platform may have an incentive to even announce an average accuracy lower than the actual value when facing strategic workers. Another counter-intuitive result is that the platform’s payoff may decrease in the number of high-accuracy workers.},

abstract = {Crowdsourcing is an online, distributed problem-solving and production model. In a crowdsourcing environment, requesters dispense tasks (through some mechanisms) to the crowd workers to be solved in a limited time. As the workers in these markets are irregular and keep changing over time, it becomes a real challenge to designate a dropout. A crowd worker, staying out of the environment for a long period, may resume back at any time in future. There have been limited attempts toward dropout prediction in crowdsourcing markets, arguably due to the disagreement in defining a dropout. Controlling the dropout rate is an important issue for the quality enhancement in crowdsourcing markets. Apart from this, there are some other factors which can enhance quality of crowdsourcing platforms from different perspectives. One of these is the feedback mechanism. In fact, the feedback mechanism might have influence over controlling the dropout rate. In this paper, our objective is to find out the significance and impact of dropout prediction and feedback mechanism together on the quality enhancement of crowdsourcing markets.},

abstract = {The challenges of food waste and insecurity arise in wealthy and developing nations alike, impacting millions of livelihoods. The ongoing pandemic only exacerbates the problem. A major force to combat food waste and insecurity, food rescue (FR) organizations match food donations to the non-profits that serve low-resource communities. Since they rely on external volunteers to pick up and deliver the food, some FRs use web-based mobile applications to reach the right set of volunteers. In this paper, we propose the first machine learning based model to improve volunteer engagement in the food waste and security domain. We (1) develop a recommender system to send push notifications to the most likely volunteers for each given rescue, (2) leverage a mathematical programming based approach to diversify our recommendations, and (3) propose an online algorithm to dynamically select the volunteers to notify without the knowledge of future rescues. Our recommendation system improves the hit ratio from 44\% achieved by the previous method to 73\%. A pilot study of our method is scheduled to take place in the near future.},

abstract = {Modern city governance relies heavily on crowdsourcing (or "co-production") to identify problems such as downed trees and power-lines. A major concern in these systems is that residents do not report problems at the same rates, leading to an inequitable allocation of government resources. However, measuring such under-reporting is a difficult statistical task, as, almost by definition, we do not observe incidents that are not reported. Thus, distinguishing between low reporting rates and low ground-truth incident rates is challenging. We develop a method to identify (heterogeneous) reporting rates, without using external (proxy) ground truth data. Our insight is that rates on duplicate reports about the same incident can be leveraged, to turn the question into a standard Poisson rate estimation task---even though the full incident reporting interval is also unobserved. We apply our method to over 100,000 resident reports made to the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation, finding that there are substantial spatial and socio-economic disparities in reporting rates, even after controlling for incident characteristics.},

We investigate how users may conceptualize, experience, and reflect on their engagement in machine teaching by deploying a mobile teachable testbed in Amazon Mechanical Turk. Using a performance-based payment scheme, Mechanical Turkers (N=100) are called to train, test, and re-train a robust recognition model in real-time with a few snapshots taken in their environment. We find that participants incorporate diversity in their examples drawing from parallels to how humans recognize objects independent of size, viewpoint, location, and illumination. Many of their misconceptions relate to consistency and model capabilities for reasoning. With limited variation and edge cases in testing, the majority of them do not change strategies on a second training attempt.},

abstract = {Crowdsourcing is a way to solve problems that need human contribution. Crowdsourcing platforms distribute replicated tasks to workers, pay them for their contribution, and aggregate answers to produce a reliable conclusion. A fundamental problem is to infer a correct answer from the set of returned results. Another challenge is to obtain a reliable answer at a reasonable cost: unlimited budget allows hiring experts or large pools of workers for each task but a limited budget forces to use resources at best.This paper considers crowdsourcing of simple boolean tasks. We first define a probabilistic inference technique, that considers difficulty of tasks and expertise of workers when aggregating answers. We then propose CrowdInc, a greedy algorithm that reduces the cost needed to reach a consensual answer. CrowdInc distributes resources dynamically to tasks according to their difficulty. We show on several benchmarks that CrowdInc achieves good accuracy, reduces costs, and we compare its performance to existing solutions.},

abstract = {In this paper, we address the problem of task redundancy in crowdsourcing systems while providing a methodology to decrease the overall effort required to accomplish a crowdsourcing task. Typical task assignment systems assign tasks to a fixed number of crowd workers, while tasks are varied in difficulty as being easy or hard tasks. Easy tasks need fewer task assignments than hard tasks. We present TRR, a task redundancy reducer that assigns tasks to crowd workers on several work iterations, that adaptively estimates how many workers are needed for each iteration for Boolean and classification task types. TRR stops assigning tasks to crowd workers upon detecting convergence between workers’ opinions that in turn reduces invested cost and time to answer a task. TRR supports Boolean, classification, and rating task types taking into consideration both crowdsourcing task assignment schemes of anonymous workers task assignments and non-anonymous workers task assignments. The paper includes experimental results by performing simulating experiments on crowdsourced datasets.},

The results provide insights on motivation, quality mechanisms and improvement areas for increased participation. 'Question and Answers' that includes information sharing and 'software development and testing' that includes Bug Bounty are identified as top crowdsourcing tasks by security specialists although they are concerned about security and privacy of information.

abstract = {Digital applications typically describe their privacy policy in lengthy and vague documents (called PrPs), but these are rarely read by users, who remain unaware of privacy risks associated with the use of these digital applications. Thus, users need to become more aware of digital applications’ policies and, thus, more confident about their choices. To raise privacy awareness, we implemented the CAP-A portal, a crowdsourcing platform which aggregates knowledge as extracted from PrP documents and motivates users in performing privacy-related tasks. The Rewarding Framework is one of the most critical components of the platform. It enhances user motivation and engagement by combining features from existing successful rewarding theories. In this work, we describe this Rewarding Framework, and show how it supports users to increase their privacy knowledge level by engaging them to perform privacy-related tasks, such as annotating PrP documents in a crowdsourcing environment. The proposed Rewarding Framework was validated by pilots ran in the frame of the European project CAP-A and by a user evaluation focused on its impact in terms of engagement and raising privacy awareness. The results show that the Rewarding Framework improves engagement and motivation, and increases users’ privacy awareness.},

abstract = {Environmental problems in the Philippines are increasing each day to the point that it endanger the lives of its citizens due to lack of awareness and information on how to address these concerns, as part of mitigating this problem, we developed a responsive web application known as TerraTech that allows users to immediately report environmental concerns in their area through the means of microtask crowdsourcing where the system would gather reports from users by means of using the approach of geocoding, reverse geocoding, and information visualization in which the end result would be used to deploy volunteers to the area of the reported concern and each reported data is converted into a visualized form for data analysis, the completed reports can be posted on Twitter to raise environmental awareness not only to the real world, but also through social media as a means of advertising the system for potential users. Furthermore, using the developed interactive map, TerraTech integrates and visualizes information per report through plotting and viewing the intensity of the number of reports per area. TerraTech is already creating a positive impact in addressing environmental concerns, it is not only improving the surroundings, but also saves the lives of the people for potential environmental disasters.},

abstract = {The increased use of machine learning in recent years led to large volumes of data being manually labeled via crowdsourcing microtasks completed by humans. This brought about dehumanization effects, namely, when task requesters overlook the humans behind the task, leading to issues of ethics (e.g., unfair payment) and amplification of human biases, which are transferred into training data and affect machine learning in the real world. We propose a framework that allocates microtasks considering human factors of workers such as demographics and compensation. We deployed our framework to a popular crowdsourcing platform and conducted experiments with 1,919 workers collecting 160,345 human judgments. By routing microtasks to workers based on demographics and appropriate pay, our framework mitigates biases in the contributor sample and increases the hourly pay given to contributors. We discuss potential extensions and how it can promote transparency in crowdsourcing.},

In this study, we present the results of crowdsourcing KCs for problems in the domain of mathematics and English writing, as a first step in leveraging the crowd to expedite this task. Crowdworkers were presented with a problem and asked to provide the underlying skills required to solve it. Additionally, we investigated the effect of priming crowdworkers with related content before having them generate these KCs.

abstract = {In Information Retrieval (IR) evaluation, preference judgments are collected by presenting to the assessors a pair of documents and asking them to select which of the two, if any, is the most relevant. This is an alternative to the classic relevance judgment approach, in which human assessors judge the relevance of a single document on a scale; such an alternative allows to make relative rather than absolute judgments of relevance. While preference judgments are easier for human assessors to perform, the number of possible document pairs to be judged is usually so high that it makes it unfeasible to judge them all. Thus, following a similar idea to pooling strategies for single document relevance judgments where the goal is to sample the most useful documents to be judged, in this work we focus on analyzing alternative ways to sample document pairs to judge, in order to maximize the value of a fixed number of preference judgments that can feasibly be collected. Such value is defined as how well we can evaluate IR systems given a budget, that is, a fixed number of human preference judgments that may be collected. By relying on several datasets featuring relevance judgments gathered by means of experts and crowdsourcing, we experimentally compare alternative strategies to select document pairs and show how different strategies lead to different IR evaluation result quality levels. Our results show that, by using the appropriate procedure, it is possible to achieve good IR evaluation results with a limited number of preference judgments, thus confirming the feasibility of using preference judgments to create IR evaluation collections.},

abstract = {UPDATED---June 1, 2020. Road traffic crashes (RTCs) are the primary cause of death among children and young adults. Yet data on RTCs is incomplete, hindering effective road safety policymaking in many developing countries where mortality is purportedly highest. We web-scrape 850,000 tweets to create crash data and develop a machine learning algorithm to geolocate RTCs. Our algorithm is nearly twice as precise as a standard geoparsing algorithm in identifying the set of locations that include the crash location. Above and beyond, it identifies the unique location of a crash from the set of possible locations in a majority of cases. We dispatch a set of motorcycle drivers to the site of the presumed crash in real time to verify the validity of the crowdsourced data and document the performance of the algorithm. The study can be used as a proof of concept for countries interested to improve RTC data at low cost through a machine learning approach and substantially increase the data available to analyze RTCs and prioritize road safety policies.},

abstract = {Worker movement information can help the spatial crowdsourcing platform to identify the right time to assign a task to a worker for successful completion of the task. However, the majority of the current assignment strategies do not consider worker movement information. This paper aims to utilize the worker movement information via transits in an online task assignment setting. The idea is to harness the waiting periods at different transit stops in a worker transit route (WTR) for performing the tasks. Given the limited availability of workers’ waiting periods at transit stops, task deadlines and workers’ preference of performing tasks with higher rewards, we define the Transit-based Task Assignment (TTA) problem. The objective of the TTA problem is to maximize the average worker rewards for motivating workers, considering the fixed worker transit models. We solve the TTA problem by considering three variants, step-by-step, from offline to batch-based online versions. The first variant is the offline version of the TTA, which can be reduced to a maximum bipartite matching problem, and be leveraged for the second variant. The second variant is the batch-based online version of the TTA, for which, we propose dividing each batch into an offline version of the TTA problem, along with additional credibility constraints to ensure a certain level of worker response quality. The third variant is the extension of the batch-based online version of the TTA (Flexible-TTA) that relaxes the strict nature of the WTR model and assumes that a task with higher reward than a worker-defined threshold value will convince the worker to stay longer at the transit stop. Through our extensive evaluation, we observe that the algorithm solving the Flexible-TTA problem outperforms the algorithms proposed to solve other variants of the TTA problems, by 55\% in terms of the number of assigned tasks, and by at least 35\% in terms of average reward for the worker. With respect to the baseline (online task assignment) algorithm, the algorithm solving the Flexible-TTA problem results in three times higher reward and at least three times faster runtime.},

abstract = {With the rapid growth of spatial crowdsourcing applications, more and more people are benefiting from it. The idea of spatial crowdsourcing is recruiting a set of workers to finish the spatial tasks. Existing worker recruitment mechanisms do not consider the variety requirement, which is easy to meet if the Spatial Crowdsourcing (SC) platform has full knowledge of the data of each worker. Since the SC platform is not fully trusted, workers are concerned about the privacy of their data. To prevent information leaks, workers’ data needs to be specially processed before it can be sent to untrusted platforms for task assignment. The data specially processed by existing privacy-preserving processing methods cannot be used directly to complete such variety tasks with high quality. To solve this problem, we propose a new variety optimization method based on the classical local differential privacy (LDP) mechanism. It can efficiently select the sets of workers with variety of categorical attributes while providing privacy protection for workers. In addition, we also propose a two-step LDP perturbation protocol that can improve the optimization result in the case of uneven distribution of worker attributes. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real datasets show that our methods can efficiently select variety worker subset with better task quality than baseline and close to optimal selection results.},

abstract = {Crowdsourcing refers to the use of public power to achieve the specific goals of companies, which is an important source for companies to achieve open innovation. With the rapid development of Internet technologies, companies and individuals increasingly participated in crowdsourcing activities, and the crowdsourcing community is becoming crowded. Numerous submissions by crowdsourcing participants increase the evaluation costs for companies and may be of variable quality. Therefore, improving participants’ creative performance to ensure high-quality submissions has become a key issue for crowdsourcing service providers. In recent years, the application of digital technologies is remodeling the original crowdsourcing mode to optimize the user experience, reflected in the task design. Based on work design theory and self-determination theory, this paper offers a framework to explain how task characteristics affect participants’ creative performance. Specifically, new technologies will strengthen participants’ motivation through three task characteristics—i.e., autonomy, feedback, and diversity—which will subsequently improve participants’ creative performance. We propose to conduct empirical research using a crowdsourcing platform to examine the research model. The findings of our research will be helpful for organizations to draw high quality submissions from crowdsourcing participants.},

isbn = {9780999241165},
abstract = {In recent years, 3D spatial crowdsourcing platforms become popular, in which users and workers travel together to their assigned workplaces for services, such as InterestingSport and Nanguache. A typical problem over 3D spatial crowdsourcing platforms is to match users with suitable workers and workplaces. Existing studies all ignored that the workers and users assigned to the same workplace should arrive almost at the same time, which is very practical in the real world. Thus, in this paper, we propose a new Simultaneous Arrival Matching (SAM), which enables workers and users to arrive at their assigned workplace within a given tolerant time. We find that the new considered arriving time constraint breaks the monotonic additivity of the result set. Thus, it brings a large challenge in designing effective and efficient algorithms for the SAM. We design Sliding Window algorithm and Threshold Scanning algorithm to solve the SAM. We conduct the experiments on real and synthetic datasets, experimental results show the effectiveness and efficiency of our algorithms.},

abstract = {Database-driven Dynamic Spectrum Sharing (DSS) enhances active monitoring of spectrum usage, such that secondary users are allowed to opportunistically access licenced spectrum with the no-harmful-interference-to-primary-user constraint. A geo-location database administrator (DBA) maintains spectrum availability over its service region by periodically collecting and processing spatio-temporal spectrum data to construct Radio Environment Maps (REMs). To attract mobile users in the outsourced sensing tasks of spectrum measurements, crowdsourced spectrum sensing has great potential in REM construction. However, false measurements submitted by faulty/malicious users cannot be neglected. Constructing better REMs based on crowdsourced spectrum sensing remains an open challenge, especially considering privacy protection of mobile users. In this work, we introduce TAC-REM (Trust-aware Crowdsourced spectrum sensing for the resulting REM optimization), a novel differentially-private reverse auction mechanism. TAC-REM allows the DBA to iteratively select trustworthy spectrum measurements in the presence of false measurements. During each iteration, the DBA employs a spatio-temporal scheme for trustworthiness evaluation, which acts as a guide for user recruitment in crowdsourced spectrum sensing. The proposed adaptive greedy algorithm gradually incorporates the most trustworthy spectrum measurements. The process of user recruitment can be modeled as a stochastic submodular maximization problem, while guaranteeing budget feasibility, approximate REM accuracy maximization, differential bid privacy. Extensive simulations confirm the efficacy and efficiency of the proposed mechanism.},

abstract = {Nowadays, crowdsourcing has become an increasingly popular paradigm for large-scale data collection, annotation, and classification. Today’s rapid growth of crowdsourcing platforms calls for effective worker selection mechanisms, which oftentimes have to operate with a priori unknown worker reliability. We discover that the empirical entropy of workers’ results, which measures the uncertainty in the final aggregated results, naturally becomes a suitable metric to evaluate the outcome of crowdsourcing tasks. Therefore, this paper designs a worker selection mechanism that minimizes the empirical entropy of the results submitted by participating workers. Specifically, we formulate worker selection under sequentially arriving tasks as a combinatorial multi-armed bandit problem, which treats each worker as an arm, and aims at learning the best combination of arms that minimize the cumulative empirical entropy. By information theoretic methods, we carefully derive an estimation of the upper confidence bound for empirical entropy minimization, and leverage it in our minimum entropy upper confidence bound (ME-UCB) algorithm to balance exploration and exploitation. Theoretically, we prove that ME-UCB has a regret upper bound of O(1), which surpasses existing submodular UCB algorithms. Our extensive experiments with both a synthetic and real-world dataset empirically demonstrate that our ME-UCB algorithm outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches.},

abstract = {In popular crowdsourcing marketplaces like Amazon Mechanical Turk, crowd workers complete tasks posted by requesters in return for monetary rewards. Task requesters are solely responsible for deciding whether to accept or reject submitted work. Rejecting work can directly affect the monetary reward of corresponding workers, and indirectly influence worker qualifications and their future work opportunities in the marketplace. Unexpected or unwarranted rejections therefore result in negative emotions and reactions among workers. Despite the high prevalence of rejections in crowdsourcing marketplaces, little research has explored ways to mitigate the negative emotional repercussions of rejections on crowd workers. Addressing this important research gap, we investigate whether introducing self-reflection at different stages after task execution can alleviate the emotional toll of rejection decisions on crowd workers. Our work is inspired by prior studies in psychology that have shown that self-reflection on negative personal experiences can positively affect one’s emotion. To this end, we carried out an experimental study investigating the impact of explicit self-reflection on the emotions of rejected crowd workers. Results show that allowing workers to self-reflect on their delivered work, especially before receiving a rejection, has a significantly positive impact on their self-reported emotions in terms of valence and dominance. Our findings reveal that introducing a self-reflection stage before workers receive acceptance or rejection decisions on submitted work, can help in positively influencing the emotions of a worker. These findings have important design implications towards fostering a healthier requester-worker relationship and contributing towards the sustainability of the crowdsourcing marketplace.},

A practical solution for this problem is to collect multiple labels per examples and aggregate them. Although gathering repeated labels improves data quality, concerning the fact that there’s a limit on the budget we can use for crowdsourcing, it can also lead to decreasing the amount of training data. This paper empirically examines to what extent the repeated labeling contribute to the accuracy of machine learning models for image classification and text information extraction in various conditions varying budgets and worker qualities. Experiments are designed to test 4 hypotheses we made each determining the effect of budgets, worker quality, task difficulty, and redundancy on crowdsourcing. The experimental results on image classification and named entity recognition supported all 4 hypotheses and surprisingly suggests, that the repeated labeling almost always brings a negative impact on machine learning accuracy.},

abstract = {Crowdsourcing has emerged as an effective platform to label data with low cost by using non-expert workers. However, inferring correct labels from multiple noisy answers on data has been a challenging problem, since the quality of answers varies widely across tasks and workers. Many existing prior works have assumed a simple model where the order of workers in terms of their reliabilities is fixed across tasks, and focused on estimating the worker reliabilities to aggregate responses with different weights. We propose a highly general crowdsourcing model in which the reliability of each worker can vary depending on the type of a given task, where the number of types d can scale in the number of tasks. In this model, we characterize the optimal sample complexity to correctly infer the unknown labels within any given accuracy, and propose an algorithm achieving the order-wise optimal result. We conduct experiments on synthetic and real datasets, and show that our algorithm outperforms the existing ones developed based on strict model assumptions. &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;},

abstract = {With the number of users in crowdsourcing increasing rapidly, task matching service is attracting more and more attention. However, it also causes many security concerns, one of which is the leakage of sensitive information. Privacy-preserving task matching techniques can protect the private information of task requesters and workers. Whereas existing privacy-preserving task matching schemes are constructed on a central server, and thereby they may suffer from potential wrongdoings of a malicious server. In addition, most of them only provide accurate task matching, which means that they cannot tolerate keyword spelling errors, leading to the decline of task matching accuracy. In this paper, we propose a Reliable and Privacy-preserving Task Matching scheme (RPTM) for crowdsourcing. To guarantee the reliability of task matching results, RPTM employs smart contracts to ensure that operations of RPTM are faithfully performed. However, it may still disclose the privacy of users due to the transparency of the blockchain. In order to deal with this problem, RPTM can perform task matching service without compromising the privacy of task requesters and workers by leveraging a novel integer vector encryption scheme. Moreover, RPTM supports multi-keyword fuzzy matching by exploiting locality sensitive hashing and Bloom filter, which can tolerate keyword spelling errors and different expression formats. Extensive analysis and experiments based on a test net of EOS show that RPTM is efficient and secure.},

abstract = {Crowdsourcing enables the completion of large-scale and hard-to-automate tasks, while allowing people to earn money. However, 3.6 billion people – a workforce comprising 46.4\% of the world population – who could benefit most from this source of income lack the access and literacy to use computers, smartphones, and the internet. In this paper we present Karamad, a voice-based crowdsourcing platform that allows workers in low-resource regions to complete crowd work using low-end phones and receive payments as mobile airtime balance. We explore the usefulness, scalability, and sustainability of Karamad in Pakistan through a 6-month deployment. Without any advertising, training, or airtime subsidies, Karamad organically engaged 725 workers who completed 3,939 tasks (involving 43,006 components) including translations, dataset generation, and surveys on demographics, accessibility, disability, health, employment, and literacy. Collectively, the workers produced a valuable service market for potential customers and included female, unemployed, non-literate, and blind users.},

Recent work has shown that crowd workers in microtask marketplaces can complete a variety of human intelligence tasks (HITs) using conversational interfaces with similar output quality compared to the traditional Web interfaces. In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of using conversational interfaces to improve worker engagement in microtask crowdsourcing. We designed a text-based conversational agent that assists workers in task execution, and tested the performance of workers when interacting with agents having different conversational styles. We conducted a rigorous experimental study on Amazon Mechanical Turk with 800 unique workers, to explore whether the output quality, worker engagement and the perceived cognitive load of workers can be affected by the conversational agent and its conversational styles. Our results show that conversational interfaces can be effective in engaging workers, and a suitable conversational style has potential to improve worker engagement.},

Community care is a key factor for successful crowdsourcing initiatives. The most important instruments tested in the image archive are presented and discussed. In order to get to know the unknown crowd better, an online survey on the motivation, work techniques and sociodemographic background among the crowd was conducted in early 2017.

abstract = {Consider the following scenario: (a) a worker traveling on the shortest path between two locations in a city's road network, (b) he/she is willing to deviate from such path in order to complete tasks in the network, (c) tasks are associated with rewards and appear and disappear dynamically, i.e., they are not known in advance, and (d) the worker specifies a time budget which limits the total time he/she is willing to spend on his/her trip. Now assume the worker wants to minimize the detour from the original path while, at the same time, maximizing the rewards collected by completing tasks; clearly two competing criteria. We call this problem the Online In-Route Task Selection (Online-IRTS) query, and we investigate it using the paradigm of skyline queries in order to systematically explore different trade-offs between earned rewards and path deviation. Because of the online nature of the problem, i.e., irrevocable decisions about which task to perform have to be made without knowledge of future tasks, it is not possible to guarantee optimal solutions for the Online-IRTS query. Therefore, we propose two heuristic approaches, one is based on local optimizations, and the other one is based on incremental solutions, along with a method to evaluate the quality of their solutions w.r.t. the optimal offline solution. Our experiments using city-scale realistic datasets show that the first approach is more effective whereas the second is more efficient, allowing one to choose which approach to use according to his/her priorities.},

abstract = {Aggregating responses from crowd workers is a fundamental task in the process of crowdsourcing. In cases where a few experts are overwhelmed by a large number of non-experts, most answer aggregation algorithms such as the majority voting fail to identify the correct answers. Therefore, it is crucial to extract reliable experts from the crowd workers. In this study, we introduce the notion of expert core, which is a set of workers that is very unlikely to contain a non-expert. We design a graph-mining-based efficient algorithm that exactly computes the expert core. To answer the aggregation task, we propose two types of algorithms. The first one incorporates the expert core into existing answer aggregation algorithms such as the majority voting, whereas the second one utilizes information provided by the expert core extraction algorithm pertaining to the reliability of workers. We then give a theoretical justification for the first type of algorithm. Computational experiments using synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed answer aggregation algorithms outperform state-of-the-art algorithms.},

abstract = {Designing tasks clearly to facilitate accurate task completion is a challenging endeavor for requesters on crowdsourcing platforms. Prior research shows that inexperienced requesters fail to write clear and complete task descriptions which directly leads to low quality submissions from workers. By complementing existing works that have aimed to address this challenge, in this paper we study whether clarity flaws in task descriptions can be identified automatically using natural language processing methods. We identify and synthesize seven clarity flaws in task descriptions that are grounded in relevant literature. We build both BERT-based and feature-based binary classifiers, in order to study the extent to which clarity flaws in task descriptions can be computationally assessed, and understand textual properties of descriptions that affect task clarity. Through a crowdsourced study, we collect annotations of clarity flaws in 1332 real task descriptions. Using this dataset, we evaluate several configurations of the classifiers. Our results indicate that nearly all the clarity flaws in task descriptions can be assessed reasonably by the classifiers. We found that the content, style, and readability of tasks descriptions are particularly important in shaping their clarity. This work has important implications on the design of tools to help requesters in improving task clarity on crowdsourcing platforms. Flaw-specific properties can provide for valuable guidance in improving task descriptions.},

Combining recommendations from the literature with the lessons that we learned whilst conducting our study, we synthesize advice for researchers in CER who are considering crowdsourcing. In our case study, we did not find widespread foul play by crowdsourced workers and, overall, our experiences and the literature suggest that crowdsourced CER is feasible. It is, however, uncertain to what extent crowdsourced data can produce answers that apply to specific educational contexts. More research is needed before definitive conclusions can be drawn about the validity and generalizability of crowdsourced CER.},

We propose a new algorithm combining alternating minimization with extreme-value filtering and provide sufficient and necessary conditions to recover the original rank-one matrix. In particular, we show that our proposed algorithm is optimal when the set of revealed entries is given by an Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi random graph.These results are then applied to the problem of classification from crowdsourced data under the assumption that while the majority of the workers are governed by the standard single-coin David-Skene model (i.e., they output the correct answer with a certain probability), some of the workers can deviate arbitrarily from this model. In particular, the "adversarial" workers could even make decisions designed to make the algorithm output an incorrect answer. Extensive experimental results show our algorithm for this problem, based on rank-one matrix completion with perturbations, outperforms all other state-of-the-art methods in such an adversarial scenario.},

abstract = {Crowdsourcing is an information system for recruiting online workers to perform human intelligent tasks (HITs) that are hard for computers. Due to the openness of crowdsourcing, dynamic online workers with different knowledge backgrounds might give conflicting labels to a task. With the assumption that workers provide their labels independently, most existing works aggregate worker labels in a voting manner, which is vulnerable to Sybil attack where the attacker earns easy rewards by coordinating several Sybil workers to share a randomized label on each task for dominating the aggregation result. A strategic Sybil attacker also attempts to evade Sybil detection. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, called TDSSA (Truth Discovery against Strategic Sybil Attack), to defend against strategic Sybil attack. Experimental results on real-world and synthetic datasets indicate that TDSSA ensures more accurate inference of true labels under various Sybil attacking scenarios, as compared to state-of-the-art methods.},

abstract = {Deep learning methods are useful for high-dimensional data and are becoming widely used in many areas of software engineering. Deep learners utilizes extensive computational power and can take a long time to train- making it difficult to widely validate and repeat and improve their results. Further, they are not the best solution in all domains. For example, recent results show that for finding related Stack Overflow posts, a tuned SVM performs similarly to a deep learner, but is significantly faster to train.This paper extends that recent result by clustering the dataset, then tuning every learners within each cluster. This approach is over 500 times faster than deep learning (and over 900 times faster if we use all the cores on a standard laptop computer). Significantly, this faster approach generates classifiers nearly as good (within 2\% F1 Score) as the much slower deep learning method. Hence we recommend this faster methods since it is much easier to reproduce and utilizes far fewer CPU resources.More generally, we recommend that before researchers release research results, that they compare their supposedly sophisticated methods against simpler alternatives (e.g applying simpler learners to build local models).},

Then, we proceeded to use rather simple methods from statistics to check if these myths are supported by the data in the SO dump provided. Through our analysis, we determined that there is an effect for eight of the nine myths the developers believed in. However, for only four of the myths the effect size is large enough to actually make a difference. Hence, we could bust five myths the developers believed in.},

Crowdsourcing provides an effective way to collect input for such tasks with low costs and has attracted significant attention.We consider top-K problems in which the focus consists in selecting the set of top-K elements, regardless of their internal ordering. Past algorithms for top-K problems were generally based on a global sorting, which perform unnecessary work sorting elements that are all selected or all rejected. The exceptions are specialized crowdsourcing algorithms that have been proposed especially for top-K selection; these algorithms, however, require a fixed amount of work to be performed, and produce no useful intermediate answer.We propose here a dynamic top-K selection algorithm that uses crowdsourced comparisons to progressively classify items into selected in top-K, and rejected. As the comparisons proceed, more and more elements are accepted; intermediate results can be provided at any time by returning the already-accepted items along with the best among the ones that are still unclassified.We show that the algorithm we develop is efficient and robust with respect to comparison noise. We illustrate the performance of algorithm both analytically and experimentally, and show that our algorithm can achieve comparable precision in the selection of top-K items with less crowdsourcing work than previous algorithms.},

abstract = {Spatial crowdsourcing (SC) is a popular type of crowdsourcing, in which all tasks are associated with locations/regions. Given an SC task, only the participants in the specified location/region are allowed to submit their answers of the task. However, outsourcing the SC tasks to a remote crowdsourcing server poses new security concerns. For example, the task requester may not want to disclose the task content to unauthorized users, and the participants may not want to disclose their locations to untrusted server. To address these issues, we propose a P rivacy-Preserving T ask A llocation for S patial C rowdsourcing (PTA-SC) scheme in this paper. In PTASC, regions and locations can be encoded into a set of prefixes based on the prefix encoding method. The location-induced prefixes are treated as attributes and the region-induced prefixes are used to generate an access policy tree for a ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption (CP-ABE) scheme. PTA-SC can check whether a location is inside an SC task region by evaluating if the attributes satisfy the access policy tree or not. Our theoretical analysis shows that PTA-SC can achieve location privacy preservation and task privacy preservation. Through experiments, we show that PTA-SC scheme can realize adaptive region representation accuracy control and high-efficiency.},

abstract = {Recently, the growing popularity of Spatial Crowd-sourcing (SC), allowing untrusted platforms to obtain a great quantity of information about workers and tasks’ locations, has raised numerous privacy concerns. In this paper, we investigate the privacy-preserving task assignment in the online scenario, where workers and tasks arrive at the platform in real time and tasks should be assigned to workers immediately. Traditional online task assignments usually make a benchmark to decide the following task assignment. However, when location privacy is considered, the benchmark does not work anymore. Hence, how to assign tasks in real time based on workers and tasks’ obfuscated locations is a challenging problem. Especially when many tasks could be assigned to one worker, path planning should be considered, making the assignment more challenging. To this end, we propose a Planar Laplace distribution based Privacy mechanism (PLP) to obfuscate real locations of workers and tasks, where the obfuscation does not change the ranking of these locations’ relative distances. Furthermore, we design a Threshold-based Online task Assignment mechanism (TOA), which could deal with the one-worker-many-tasks assignment and achieve a satisfactory competitive ratio. Simulations based on two real-world datasets show that the proposed algorithm consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art approach.},

abstract = {In this paper we present a crowdsourcing-based approach for collecting dialog data for a social chat dialog system, which gradually builds a dialog graph from actual user responses and crowd-sourced system answers, conditioned by a given persona and other instructions. This approach was tested during the second instalment of the Amazon Alexa Prize 2018 (AP2018), both for the data collection and to feed a simple dialog system which would use the graph to provide answers. As users interacted with the system, a graph which maintained the structure of the dialogs was built, identifying parts where more coverage was needed. In an offline evaluation, we have compared the corpus collected during the competition with other potential corpora for training chatbots, including movie subtitles, online chat forums and conversational data. The results show that the proposed methodology creates data that is more representative of actual user utterances, and leads to more coherent and engaging answers from the agent. An implementation of the proposed method is available as open-source code.},

abstract = {In this paper, we study a new type of Spatial Crowdsourcing (SC), namely Distributed SC (DSC), which can support a variety of location-relative services demanded by different requesters with low latency and bandwidth costs. In DSC, requesters need to compete for limited resources so as to deploy their desired SC services, and the requested resources must be allocated together to meet the demand of the service. We model this competitive resource allocation problem as a combinatorial auction process. Since this problem is NP-hard, we design an approximation algorithm to solve it. Besides, the leakage of sensitive information such as bids may incur severe economic damage, and there is a lack of works that can provide efficient protection without a trustworthy third-party. Based on this, we propose a novel Differentially private Resource Auction (DRA) mechanism. A bid confusion strategy based on differential privacy is designed against the untrusted third-party. Moreover, we prove that DRA offers ϵ-differential privacy, γ-truthfulness, individual rationality and computational efficiency. Finally, extensive simulations on a real trace confirm the efficacy of DRA and indicate good performance in accordance with the design expectations.},

In this work, we investigate how to eliminate the hidden feature of H-POIs by enhancing conventional crowdsourced ranking aggregation framework with heterogeneous (i.e., H-POI and Popular Point of Interest (P-POI)) pairwise tasks. We propose a two-phase solution focusing on both effectiveness and efficiency. In offline phase, we substantially narrow down the search space by retrieving a set of geo-textual valid heterogeneous pairs as the initial candidates and develop two practical data-driven strategies to compute worker qualities. In the online phase, we minimize the cost of assessment by introducing an active learning algorithm to jointly select pairs and workers with worker quality, uncertainty of P-POI rankings and uncertainty of the model taken into account. In addition, a (Minimum Spanning) Tree-constrained Skip search strategy is proposed for the purpose of reducing search time cost. Empirical experiments based on real POI datasets verify that the ranking accuracy of H-POIs can be greatly improved with small number of query iterations.},

The way to encourage platforms to take part in cooperation is essential. A viable method is to make each platform in cooperation get higher revenue via allocating the revenue generated by cooperation. However, the current work lack studies on the revenue allocation in SC platform cooperation. In this paper, based on cooperative game theory, we propose some ideal properties that the revenue allocation method should satisfy. Then, based on Shapley value, we propose a fair revenue allocation method named SRA, measured by the marginal contribution of each platform. Given the exponential complexity of the method, we propose an efficient approximation method, Coalition-based Shapley value Revenue Allocation (CSRA). Extensive experimental results verify the effectiveness and efficiency of our algorithms.},

abstract = {Crowdsourcing has become a popular method for collecting labeled training data. However, in many practical scenarios traditional labeling can be difficult for crowdworkers(for example, if the data is high-dimensional or unintuitive, or the labels are continuous). In this work, we develop a novel model for crowdsourcing that can complement standard practices by exploiting people»s intuitions about groups and relations between them. We employ a recent machine learning setting, called Ballpark Learning, that can estimate individual labels given only coarse, aggregated signal over groups of data points. To address the important case of continuous labels, we extend the Ballpark setting(which focused on classification) to regression problems. We formulate the problem as a convex optimization problem and propose fast, simple methods with an innate robustness to outliers. We evaluate our methods on real-world datasets, demonstrating how useful constraints about groups can be harnessed from a crowd of non-experts. Our methods can rival supervised models trained on many true labels, and can obtain considerably better results from the crowd than a standard label-collection process(for a lower price). By collecting rough guesses on groups of instances and using machine learning to infer the individual labels, our lightweight framework is able to address core crowdsourcing challenges and train machine learning models in a cost-effective way.},

abstract = {A significant challenge for creating efficient and fair crowdsourcing platforms is in rapid assessment of the quality of crowdwork. If a crowdworker lacks the skill, motivation, or understanding to provide adequate quality task completion, this reduces the efficacy of a platform. While this would seem like only a problem for task providers, the reality is that the burden of this problem is increasingly leveraged on crowdworkers. For example, task providers may not pay crowdworkers for their work after the evaluation of the task results has been completed. In this paper, we propose methods for quickly evaluating the quality of crowdwork using eye gaze information by estimating the correct answer rate. We find that the method with features generated by self-supervised learning&nbsp;(SSL) provides the most efficient result with a mean absolute error of 0.09. The results exhibit the potential of using eye gaze information to facilitate adaptive personalized crowdsourcing platforms.},

Standard text categorization approaches, e.g. multinomial Naive Bayes, are likely to be unsuitable for this classification task because of: i) the lack of sufficient informative content in the questions due to their relatively short length; and ii) considerable vocabulary overlap between the classes. To increase the robustness of this classification task, we propose to use the neighbourhood of existing questions which are similar to the newly asked question. Instead of learning the classification boundary from the questions alone, we transform each question vector into a different one in the feature space. We explore two different neighbourhood functions using: the discrete term space, the continuous vector space of real numbers obtained from vector embeddings of documents. Experiments conducted on StackOverflow data show that our approach of using the neighborhood transformation can improve classification accuracy by up to about 8\%.},

To address this challenge, we adopt the crowdsourcing paradigm to offer some incentive for guiding the movement of recruited crowdsourcing users and facilitate the optimization of the movement control decision. In this paper, based on a practical 4G (4th-Generation) network throughput measurement study, we formulate the movement control decision as a cost-constrained user recruitment optimization problem. Considering the intractable complexity of this problem, we focus first on a single crowdsourcing user case and propose a pseudo-polynomial time complexity optimal solution. Then, we apply this solution to solve the more general problem of multiple users and propose a graph-partition-based algorithm.

Dissatisfaction might lead to lower levels of engagement and effort exposed on the crowdsourcing platform thus leading to diminishing working results. The results of the current study show that we can delineate platform features that would be attributed to the theoretically proposed hygiene factors of the pay plan, working conditions, status, job security, benefits as well as policies and supervisory practices influencing levels of dissatisfaction on a crowdsourcing platform. In addition, this study shows that pay-plan, working conditions, job security, policies, and supervisory practices are indeed of the most important for the workers. Hence, improving the above-said features is a good way for lowering workers' level of dissatisfaction. A clear understanding of what influence workers could help work providers and platform managers to implement new features and rules so as to discard the diminishing influence of dissatisfaction.},

abstract = {Crowdsourcing has become a popular tool for large-scale data collection where it is often assumed that crowd workers complete the work independently. In this paper, we relax such independence property and explore the usage of peer communication-a kind of direct interactions between workers-in crowdsourcing. In particular, in the crowdsourcing setting with peer communication, a pair of workers are asked to complete the same task together by first generating their initial answers to the task independently and then freely discussing the task with each other and updating their answers after the discussion. We first experimentally examine the effects of peer communication on individual microtasks. Our results conducted on three types of tasks consistently suggest that work quality is significantly improved in tasks with peer communication compared to tasks where workers complete the work independently. We next explore how to utilize peer communication to optimize the requester's total utility while taking into account higher data correlation and higher cost introduced by peer communication. In particular, we model the requester's online decision problem of whether and when to use peer communication in crowdsourcing as a constrained Markov decision process which maximizes the requester's total utility under budget constraints. Our proposed approach is empirically shown to bring higher total utility compared to baseline approaches.},

abstract = {In a crowd market such as Amazon Mechanical Turk, the remuneration of Human Intelligence Tasks is determined by the requester, for which they are not given many cues to ascertain how to "fairly'' pay their workers. Furthermore, the current methods for setting a price are mostly binary -- in that, the worker either gets paid or not -- as opposed to paying workers a "fair'' wage based on the quality and utility of work completed. Instead, the price should better reflect the historical performance of the market and the requirements of the task. In this paper, we introduce a game theoretical model that takes into account a more balanced set of market parameters, and propose a pricing policy and a rating policy to incentivize requesters to offer "fair'' compensation for crowdsourcing workers. We present our findings from applying and developing this model on real data gathered from workers on Amazon Mechanical Turk and simulations that we ran to validate our assumptions. Our simulation results also demonstrate that our policies motivate requesters to pay their workers more "fairly'' compared with the payment set by the current market.},

abstract = {Many online social networking platforms are leveraging crowdsourcing to enhance the user experience. These platforms seek to incentivize heterogeneous workers to exert efforts to complete tasks (e.g., moderation of posts and articles) and truthfully report their solutions. Output agreement mechanism (e.g., majority voting) is a common approach to this end. In an output agreement mechanism, a worker is rewarded according to whether his solution matches those of his peers. However, prior related work has not studied the workers' heterogeneous solution accuracy and how this heterogeneity affects the platform's payoff. We fill this void by modeling and analyzing the interactions between the platform and workers as a two-stage Stackelberg game. In Stage I, the platform chooses the reward level for the majority voting to maximize its payoff. In Stage II, the workers decide their effort levels and reporting strategies to maximize their payoffs. We show that as a worker's solution accuracy increases, he is more likely to exert effort and truthfully report his solution under the equilibrium reward mechanism. However, given a fixed total worker population, it is surprising that the platform's overall payoff does not monotonically increase in the number of high-accuracy workers. This is because a larger number of high-accuracy workers brings marginally decreasing benefit to the platform, but the rewards required to incentivize them may significantly grow. Moreover, we show that as the solutions of the high-accuracy workers become more accurate, the platform needs a smaller number of such workers to achieve the maximum payoff.},

abstract = {Digital devices are an integral part of our lives. Through these devices, people produce and save personal data, with or without their explicit awareness. This personal digital information has been exploited by companies, but users find it hard to access and search in a uniform way, due to the heterogeneity, fragmentation of data and non-uniform access interface. By integrating and organizing this information into common kinds of everyday episodes ("scripts") that people engage in, we can help users recall and explore forgotten details of their past. However, being able to recognize such episodes in the user’s personal digital information requires not only script knowledge (e.g., the steps/actions in the script), but also explicit knowledge about the digital traces potentially left behind by each of the actions. In this paper, we present "One Of Us", a web-based multiplayer game, which collects descriptions of different kinds of personal digital traces, by having players identify the digital traces that might be produced by each of the actions in a given script. We report on the results of an experimental study, which gives evidence that our game is i) enjoyable, ii) accounts for uncommon answers, iii) validates and assesses knowledge by having the players vote on other’s responses - thus not requiring a second round of quality assessment, and iv) dynamically acquires new pieces of information.},

abstract = {When acquiring labels from crowdsourcing platforms, a task may be designed to include multiple labels and the values of each label may belong to a set of various distinct options, which is the so-called multi-class multi-label annotation. To improve the quality of labels, one task is independently completed by a group of heterogeneous crowdsourced workers. Then, the true values of the multiple labels of each task are inferred from these repeated noisy labels. In this paper, we propose a novel probabilistic method, which includes a multi-class multi-label dependency (MCMLD) model, to address this problem. The proposed method assumes that the label-correlation exists in both unknown true labels and noisy crowdsourced labels. Thus, it introduces a mixture of multiple independently multinoulli distributions to capture the correlation among the labels. Finally, the unknown true values of the multiple labels of each task, together with a set of confusion matrices modeling the reliability of the workers, can be jointly inferred through an EM algorithm. Experiments with three simulated typical crowdsourcing scenarios and a real-world dataset consistently show that our proposed MCMLD method significantly outperforms several competitive alternatives. Furthermore, if the labels are strongly correlated, the advantage of MCMLD will be more remarkable.},

abstract = {Effectively monitoring border crossing time is of great importance to various stakeholders. Border crossing information systems currently implemented along the United States-Mexico border require a large installed base of sensors, costly for installation and maintenance. This study provides a preliminary assessment of market-available connected vehicle (CV) data in border crossing time estimation. We evaluated one week of CV data collected at the Paso del Norte (PDN) port of entry (POE). We used a set of big data analytic tools to process big CV datasets and generated CV-based border crossing times (CV-Time). Then, we evaluated the correlation between the CV-Time and the existing Bluetooth-generated border crossing times (Bluetooth-Time) at the PDN POE. Last, we built a regression model to estimate the Bluetooth-Time (ground truth data) based on CV-based variables. The results demonstrate that the CV-Time is strongly correlated with the Bluetooth-Time, with a correlation rate of approximately 0.89. This study demonstrates that the market-available CV data is a potential data source for monitoring border crossing times.},

abstract = {Crowdsourcing leverages the diverse skill sets of large collections of individual contributors to solve problems and execute projects, where contributors may vary significantly in experience, expertise, and interest in completing tasks. Hence, to ensure the satisfaction of its task requesters, most existing crowdsourcing platforms focus primarily on supervising contributors' behavior. This lopsided approach to supervision negatively impacts contributor engagement and platform sustainability.In this paper, we introduce rating mechanisms to evaluate requesters' behavior, such that the health and sustainability of crowdsourcing platform can be improved. We build a game theoretical model to systematically account for the different goals of requesters, contributors, and platform, and their interactions. On the basis of this model, we focus on a specific application, in which we aim to design a rating policy that incentivizes requesters to engage lessexperienced contributors. Considering the hardness of the problem, we develop a time efficient heuristic algorithm with theoretical bound analysis. Finally, we conduct a user study in Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) to validate the central hypothesis of the model. We provide a simulation based on 3 million task records extracted from MTurk demonstrating that our rating policy can appreciably motivate requesters to hire less-experienced contributors.},

It has been widely used in areas of real-time localization, such as data collection and fingerprint calibration. Currently, crowdsourcing-based localization are mainly designed for WiFi signals. However, due to the excellent performance on real-time positioning, Ultra-Wideband (UWB) has attracted the attention of major smart device makers. It is highly expected that UWB will be supported by smart devices in the near future. With this consideration, a crowdsourcing localization scheme is introduced based characteristics of UWB signals. Compared to existing positioning technologies, the proposed scheme does not require direct connection between UWB anchors and smart devices. Instead, the smart devices collaborate with peers to complete the positioning process. Finally, a simulation example is provided as a demonstration and to evaluate the performance.},

And we consider a complex scenario that the workers may have some different skills and a task may require a set of skills. What's more, in this framework, we propose an incentive mechanism which considered the feedbacks from task publishers and then adjust the skill level of workers.

The Generative Ranking based Sequential Recommendation Model (GRS) is proposed to solve the problems mentioned above. The generative layer is introduced into a translation-based recommendation model to prevent overfitting problem. By generating latent vector in feature space, the interpolation between encoded points is highly reduced and the model is adapted to achieve better performance by embedding auxiliary features into the model. The efficiency and feasibility of the model is validated by the experiment in different datasets extracted from crowdsourcing platforms.},

abstract = {Despite many exciting innovations in computer vision, recent studies reveal a number of risks in existing computer vision systems, suggesting results of such systems may be unfair and untrustworthy. Many of these risks can be partly attributed to the use of a training image dataset that exhibits sampling biases and thus does not accurately reflect the real visual world. Being able to detect potential sampling biases in the visual dataset prior to model development is thus essential for mitigating the fairness and trustworthy concerns in computer vision. In this paper, we propose a three-step crowdsourcing workflow to get humans into the loop for facilitating bias discovery in image datasets. Through two sets of evaluation studies, we find that the proposed workflow can effectively organize the crowd to detect sampling biases in both datasets that are artificially created with designed biases and real-world image datasets that are widely used in computer vision research and system development.},

abstract = {Crowdsourcing services provide a fast, efficient, and cost-effective means of obtaining large labeled data for supervised learning. Ground truth inference, also called label integration, designs proper aggregation strategies to infer the unknown true label of each instance from the multiple noisy label set provided by ordinary crowd workers. However, to the best of our knowledge, nearly all existing label integration methods focus solely on the multiple noisy label set itself of the individual instance while totally ignoring the intercorrelation among multiple noisy label sets of different instances. To solve this problem, a multiple noisy label distribution propagation (MNLDP) method is proposed in this study. MNLDP first transforms the multiple noisy label set of each instance into its multiple noisy label distribution and then propagates its multiple noisy label distribution to its nearest neighbors. Consequently, each instance absorbs a fraction of the multiple noisy label distributions from its nearest neighbors and yet simultaneously maintains a fraction of its own original multiple noisy label distribution. Promising experimental results on simulated and real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of our proposed method.},

To this end, we propose a joint aggregation and worker clustering model that detects patterns underlying crowd worker labels to characterize varieties of labeling errors. We evaluate our approach on a Named Entity Recognition dataset labeled by Mechanical Turk workers in both a retrospective experiment and a small human study. The former shows that our joint model improves the quality of clusters vs. aggregation followed by clustering. Results of the latter suggest that clusters aid human sense-making in interpreting worker labels and predicting worker mistakes. By enabling better explanation of annotator mistakes, our model creates a new opportunity to help Requesters improve task instructions and to help crowd annotators learn from their mistakes.

Little, however, is known as to which practices these crowdfarms use to tackle the macrotasks, and this goes hand in hand with the current practice of the HCI research community to treat all forms of complex crowdsourcing work as practically the same. However, macrotasks differ substantially regarding structure and decomposability. Treating them under one umbrella term - macrotasking - can lead to an imprecise understanding of the workforce involved. We address this gap by examining the work practices of 31 Chinese crowdfarms on the four main macrotask types, namely: modular, interlaced, wicked, and container macrotasks. Our results confirm essential differences in how these nascent crowd organizations address different macrotasks and shed light on what platforms can do to improve the uptake of such work.},

Yet, while it is commonly assumed that people are likely to perform these tasks during activity breakpoints, it remains unclear whether different types of such breakpoints affect the likelihood that crowdsourcing tasks will be performed. To explore this question, we classified breakpoints into five types, according to phone users' preceding, current, and upcoming activities, and conducted a six-week experience sampling method study of 30 users' breakpoint-type-specific crowdsourcing-task performance behavior. We found that these participants tended to engage in crowdsourcing tasks when they were at breakpoints between two different activities, rather than within an activity, and also when breakpoints were long. Additionally, the higher the complexity of their previous activity, the lower the crowdsourcing-task execution rate. However, high complexity of the post-crowdsourcing task activity had no obvious impact on execution rate.},

abstract = {In Spatial Crowdsourcing (SC) systems, mobile users are enabled to perform spatio-temporal tasks by physically traveling to specified locations with the SC platforms. SC platforms manage the systems and recruit mobile users to contribute to the SC systems, whose commercial success depends on the profit attained from the task requesters. In order to maximize its profit, an SC platform needs an online management mechanism to assign the tasks to suitable workers. How to assign the tasks to workers more cost-effectively with the spatio-temporal constraints is one of the most difficult problems in SC. To deal with this challenge, we propose a novel Profit-driven Task Assignment (PTA) problem, which aims to maximize the profit of the platform. Specifically, we first establish a task reward pricing model with tasks' temporal constraints (i.e., expected completion time and deadline). Then we adopt an optimal algorithm based on tree decomposition to achieve the optimal task assignment and propose greedy algorithms to improve the computational efficiency.

abstract = {This article presents a solution developed on top of the LdoD Archive for the classification of fragments in the context of a virtual edition, through the use of a serious game strategy. Participants select a classification for a fragment after following a series of steps that require them to propose tags for fragments and then vote on other participants’ tags. The goal of the game is twofold: it can be used as a crowdsourced tool to classify texts from the Book of Disquiet, in the context of a virtual edition, and it functions as a collaborative learning tool for the reading and analysis of texts from the Book of Disquiet.},

abstract = {In this paper, we study the privacy-preserving task assignment problem in spatial crowdsourcing, where the locations of both workers and tasks, prior to their release to the server, are perturbed with Geo-Indistinguishability (a differential privacy notion for location-based systems). Different from the previously studied online setting, where each task is assigned immediately upon arrival, we target the batch-based setting, where the server maximizes the number of successfully assigned tasks after a batch of tasks arrive. To achieve this goal, we propose the k-Switch solution, which first divides the workers into small groups based on the perturbed distance between workers/tasks, and then utilizes Homomorphic Encryption (HE) based secure computation to enhance the task assignment. Furthermore, we expedite HE-based computation by limiting the size of the small groups under k. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, in terms of the number of successfully assigned tasks, the k-Switch solution improves batch-based baselines by 5.9X and the existing online solution by 1.74X, with no privacy leak.},

abstract = {Small automatically assessed programming assignments are an often used resource for learning programming. Creating sufficiently large amounts of such assignments is, however, time consuming. As a consequence, offering large quantities of practice assignments to students is not always possible. CrowdSorcerer is an embeddable open-source system that students and teachers alike can use for creating and evaluating small automatically assessed programming assignments. While creating programming assignments, the students also write simple input-output -tests, and are gently introduced to the basics of testing. Students can also evaluate the assignments of others and provide feedback on them, which exposes them to code written by others early in their education. In this article we both describe the CrowdSorcerer system and our experiences in using the system in a large undergraduate programming course. Moreover, we discuss the motivation for crowdsourcing course assignments and present some usage statistics.},

Some newer techniques rely on crowdsourcing of manual transcription. Crowdsourcing helps speeding up the transcription process, but it is still limited and brings with it new challenges.Though crowdsourcing transcriptions can imply a repetitive task done by a large group of users, there is in fact room for personalization. This paper reports on insights gathered for future personalizations from the "Tikkoun Sofrim" project, that implements a framework for combining automatic handwritten text recognition with crowdsourcing for transcription of complete handwritten manuscripts.

abstract = {Mobile crowdsourcing has become an efficient paradigm for performing large scale tasks. The incentive mechanism is important for the mobile crowdsourcing system to stimulate participants, and to achieve good service quality. In this paper, we focus on solving the insufficient participation problem in the budget constrained online crowdsourcing system. We present a two-tiered social crowdsourcing architecture, which can enable the selected registered users to recruit their social neighbors by diffusing the tasks to their social circles. In the two-tiered social crowdsourcing system, the tasks are associated with different end times, and both the registered users and their social neighbors have different arrival/departure times. An online incentive mechanism, MTSC, which consists of two steps: Agent Selection and Online Reverse Auction, is proposed for this novel mobile crowdsourcing system. Through both rigorous theoretical analysis and extensive simulations, we demonstrate that the proposed incentive mechanism achieves computational efficiency, individual rationality, budget feasibility, cost truthfulness, and time truthfulness.},

Designers typically rely on experience or subjective judgment in the absence of analytical or objective means for selecting interface parameters. We demonstrate Bayesian optimization as an efficient tool for objective interface feature refinement. Specifically, we show that crowdsourcing paired with Bayesian optimization can rapidly and effectively assist interface design across diverse deployment environments. Experiment 1 evaluates the approach on a familiar 2D interface design problem: a map search and review use case. Adding a degree of complexity, Experiment 2 extends Experiment 1 by switching the deployment environment to mobile-based virtual reality. The approach is then demonstrated as a case study for a fundamentally new and unfamiliar interaction design problem: web-based augmented reality. Finally, we show how the model generated as an outcome of the refinement process can be used for user simulation and queried to deliver various design insights.},

In this paper, we propose a crowdsourcing trajectory based indoor positioning multisource database construction method that can be used to collect fingerprints and construct the radio map by exploiting the trajectories of smartphone users. By integrating multisource information from the smartphone sensors (e.g., camera, accelerometer, and gyroscope), this system can accurately reconstruct the geometry of trajectories. After then, the location of trajectories can be spatially estimated in the reference coordinate system. The experimental results show that the average calibration error of the fingerprints is 0.67&nbsp;m. A weighted k-nearest neighbor method (without any optimization) and image matching method are used to evaluate the performance of constructed multisource database. The average localization error of RSS based indoor positioning and image based positioning are 3.2&nbsp;m and 1.2&nbsp;m respectively.},

In this paper, we present an empirical study in which we analyzed task documentation and online forums messages associated with 25 Software Crowdsourcing (SW CS) challenges. The findings corroborate that weak documentation is a challenge in SW CS. Meanwhile, online forums allow crowd workers to gather additional technical and operational information that is not present in the official task documentation. We provide a stepping stone towards understanding the interplay between requirements and communication, to make it possible to improve SW CS development processes, practices, and tools.},

abstract = {Crowdsourcing is a new paradigm which divides work between participants to achieve a cumulative result. To achieve good service quality for a crowdsourcing system, incentive mechanisms are necessary to attract more workers to participate. Most of existing mechanisms apply only for the crowdsourcing scenario where the crowdsourcer will employ the workers to perform certain tasks only in a single market. In this paper, we consider that the crowd-sourcer would like to allocate tasks to several different sub-markets with a shared budget. The crowdsourcer wants to maximize her utility through the crowdsourcing campaign with certain budget constraint. We design two optimization objectives for our problem, maximin and weighted average. We propose a cross-market profit extract mechanism based on random sampling. Furthermore, we extend our algorithm to the online condition, and give the performance lowerbound for both offline and online cases for the cross-market crowdsourcing system. We also conduct extensive numerical experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.},

abstract = {Thinking aloud (TA) is a widely employed usability testing method and allows identifying usability problems based on testers’ verbalization. Conducting TA studies is laborious and expensive due to the recruiting of participants, the required workforce and facilities, and the resulting monetary costs. Also, it is usually carried out in very controlled settings like laboratories, thereby limiting participants’ diversity, test realism, and the quality of the results. Crowdsourcing, in contrast, provides access to a wide and diverse workforce at moderate costs. Hence, it might help to overcome the limitations of traditional TA. Although usability testing has been successfully crowdsourced with other methods before, there is still no evidence on the feasibility of conducting TA involving unsupervised workers as testers. Thus, we conducted a between-subjects user study using the example of an online web page, both via a traditional remote TA setup and a crowdsourcing setup with a self-developed platform. The results do not show a significant difference between both setups regarding participants’ performance, and the quality and quantity of the identified usability problems. Therefore, we conclude that crowdsourcing is a feasible and cost-effective solution to conduct usability testing with the TA method, at least for selected use cases.},

abstract = {Crowdsourcing is an approach whereby employers call for workers online with different capabilities to process a task for monetary reward. With a vast amount of tasks posted every day, satisfying the workers, employers, and service providers who are the stakeholders of any crowdsourcing system is critical to its success. To achieve this, the system should address three objectives: (1) match the worker with suitable tasks that fit the worker's interests and skills and raise the worker's rewards and rating, (2) give the employer more acceptable solutions with lower cost and time and raise the employer's rating, and (3) raise the rate of accepted tasks, which will raise the aggregated commissions to the service provider and improve the average rating of the registered users (employers and workers) accordingly. For these objectives, we present a mechanism design that is capable of reaching holistic satisfaction using a multi-objective recommendation system. In contrast, all previous crowdsourcing recommendation systems are designed to address one stakeholder who could be either the worker or the employer. Moreover, our unique contribution is to consider each stakeholder to be self serving. Considering selfish behavior from every stakeholder, we provide a more qualified recommendation for each stakeholder.},

abstract = {Conducting in-field performance analysis for wireless carrier coverage and capacity evaluation is extremely costly, in terms of equipment, manpower, and time. Hence, there is a growing number of opportunities that exist for crowdsourcing via smart applications, firmware, and cellular standards. These facilities offer carriers feedback about user-perceived wireless channel quality. Crowdsourcing provides the ability to rapidly collect feedback with dense levels of penetration using client smartphones. However, mobile phones often fail to capture the fidelity and high sampling rate of more advanced equipment (e.g., a channel scanner) used when drive testing for analysis of propagation characteristics. In this work, we study the impact of various effects induced by user equipment (UE), when sampling signal quality. These shortcomings include averaging over multiple samples, imprecise quantization, and non-uniform and/or less frequent channel sampling. We specifically, investigate the accuracy of characterizing large-scale fading using crowdsourced data in presence of the aforementioned phone measurement shortcomings. To do so, we conduct extensive in-field experiments across heterogeneous devices and environments to empirically quantify the perceived channel characteristics by phone measurements. Analyzing the quality of the smartphone measurements in LTE indicates that the inferred radio propagation models, is comparable with models obtained by advanced equipment.},

This work reports on a study that involved 101 employees from two multinational enterprises. We adopt a user-centric approach to apply and experiment with gamification for enterprise crowdsourcing purposes. Through a qualitative study, we highlight the importance of the competitive and collaborative social dynamics within the enterprise. By engaging the employees with a mobile crowdsourcing application, we showcase the effectiveness of competitiveness towards higher levels of engagement and quality of contributions. Moreover, we underline the contradictory nature of those dynamics, which combined might lead to detrimental effects towards the engagement to crowdsourcing activities.},

abstract = {Websites play an increasingly important role. They are not only a good marketing resource but also a power business tool. To make websites reliable and always available for customers, a large number of website monitoring services have been developed to periodically check the website uptime and performance. These services typically have a very limited number of checkpoints (i.e., geographical locations where we send monitoring requests to check the websites) and internet service providers (ISP) used by these checkpoints; it is because deploying checkpoints with low usage frequency would waste them a huge amount of money. Thus they cannot detect that a website is reachable from a city and an ISP but is unreachable from the others. To address this issue, this paper presents a crowdsourcing-based approach that makes use of browser extensions as checkpoints to monitor websites. Our main contributions include: (i) a website monitoring approach that combines the concepts of crowdsourcing and browser extensions; (ii) a batch processing technique for handling monitoring requests; (iii) the architecture of a conceptual crowdsourcing-based system for website monitoring that can coordinate a large number of crowd members; and (iv) various techniques to enhance the quality of monitoring.},

abstract = {In this work, we present an open-source web-platform for crowdsourcing a unique kind of image labels. This is done by introducing image segments that we refer to by the term “distinguishable patches”; as the name implies, a distinguishable patch is a small segment of an image that identifies a particular object. Although these distinguishable patches will naturally be part of the object; more often than not, these distinguishable patches combined will not cover the entire body of the object, which makes the nature of the data collected distinct and rather different than what would be obtained from a traditional image segmentation system. To minimize human labeling efforts while maximizing the amount of labeled data collected, we introduce a novel top-bottom hierarchical approach to automatically determine the size and the location of the patches our system will present to individuals (referred to by “workers”) for labeling, based on previously labeled patches. The three processes of: determining the size and location of the patch, assigning a particular patch to the right worker, and the actual cropping of these patches, all happen in real-time and as the workers are actively using our web-platform. As far as the authors are aware, this unique form of image data has not been collected in the past, and its impact has not been explored, which makes this work highly valuable and important to the research community. One of the many ways that the authors are interested in using these distinguishable patches would be to improve the accuracy of a machine learning image classification system, by providing an enriched dataset of images that not only contain a single label for each image, but rather a spatial distribution of the distinguishability of an object in each image.},

abstract = {Eye movements provide insight into what parts of an image a viewer finds most salient, interesting, or relevant to the task at hand. Unfortunately, eye tracking data, a commonly-used proxy for attention, is cumbersome to collect. Here we explore an alternative: a comprehensive web-based toolbox for crowdsourcing visual attention. We draw from four main classes of attention-capturing methodologies in the literature. ZoomMaps is a novel zoom-based interface that captures viewing on a mobile phone. CodeCharts is a self-reporting methodology that records points of interest at precise viewing durations. ImportAnnots is an "annotation" tool for selecting important image regions, and cursor-based BubbleView lets viewers click to deblur a small area. We compare these methodologies using a common analysis framework in order to develop appropriate use cases for each interface. This toolbox and our analyses provide a blueprint for how to gather attention data at scale without an eye tracker.},

abstract = {We present Electrosense: a distributed, collaborative and low-cost wireless spectrum monitoring solution which is deployed on a large scale. The proposed framework provides tools to enable and promote a crowdsourced open spectrum monitoring platform for wide area deployments. The collected spectrum data is stored and processed in the backend which can be easily retrieved by the users through an open API. The framework also allows using various signal processing algorithms deployed on the sensors as well as in the backend. These algorithms provide statistics on spectrum usage, collaborative spectrum data decoding, help in applications like anomaly detection and localization. The goal of the demo is to introduce the framework, show the infrastructure already deployed, how to join the network and demo a few built-in applications.},

abstract = {Online communities are flourishing as social meeting web-spaces for users and peer community members. Different online communities require different levels of competence for participants to join, and scattered evidence suggests that women can be overly under-represented. Moreover, anecdotal evidence of the Q&amp;, A website Stack Overflow suggests that women withdraw from unfriendly online communities. Due to the lack of empirical evidence on the matter, this paper provides a quantitative study of the phenomenon, in order to assess the representation and social impact of gender in Stack Overflow. This study positions itself within recent and focused international initiatives, launched by the European Commission in order to encourage women in the field of sciences and technology. Our findings confirm that men represent the vast majority of contributors to Stack Overflow. Moreover, men participate more, earn more reputation, and engage in the "game" more than women do.},

abstract = {This paper addresses the pipeline processing of sequential workflows in crowdsourcing. Sequential workflows consisting of several subtasks are ubiquitous in crowdsourcing. Our approach is to control the budget distribution to subtasks in order to balance the execution speed of the subtasks and to improve throughput of overall sequential workflows. As we cannot control the price for earlier steps retrospectively in the stepwise batch execution, we explore pipeline processing schemes. Our experimental results show that our pipeline processing scheme with price control achieves significantly higher throughput of sequential workflows.},

abstract = {Personal deliberation, the process through which people can form an informed opinion on social issues, serves an important role in helping citizens construct a rational argument in the public deliberation. However, existing information channels for public policies deliver only few stakeholders' voices, thus failing to provide a diverse knowledge base for personal deliberation. This paper presents an initial design of PolicyScape, an online system that supports personal deliberation on public policies by helping citizens explore diverse stakeholders and their perspectives on the policy's effect. Building on literature on crowdsourced policymaking and policy stakeholders, we present several design choices for crowdsourcing stakeholder perspectives. We introduce perspective-taking as an approach for personal deliberation by helping users consider stakeholder perspectives on policy issues. Our initial results suggest that PolicyScape could collect diverse sets of perspectives from the stakeholders of public policies, and help participants discover unexpected viewpoints of various stakeholder groups.},

abstract = {Accessibility maps enable impaired/elderly people to move around more smoothly and with less risk. However, very few examples satisfy both the accuracy and coverage requirements, owing to the high cost of physically auditing everchanging roads and pathways. Although crowdsourcing approaches can ostensibly solve this problem, existing studies have relied on volunteers with free time and high motivation. In this paper, we propose a crowdsourcing platform for constructing accessibility maps to support four participation modes: Reporter for people having plenty of free time and high motivation; Gaming reporter for people having plenty of free time but with low motivation; Walker for people lacking enough free time but with high motivation; and Gaming walker for people lacking enough free time and with low motivation. This design allows people to select a suitable participation method, depending on their time and motivation. In this study, we developed a prototype by integrating deep learning techniques, a game design theory, and heatmap visualization.},

abstract = {Crowdsourcing and human computation are useful in a number of real-world applications. Crowds generate large data sets useful for natural language processing and computer vision; they work together to formulate intelligent responses far beyond what we can automate; and they power intelligent interactive systems currently impossible with automated approaches alone. In this course, affendees will learn how to work with the crowd to enable research and practical applications. They will gain experience from the worker's perspective, receive an introduction to writing programs that work with existing sources of crowds, (e.g., Amazon Mechanical Turk), apply usability principles for designing crowd tasks that elicit high-quality responses, use statistical methods to improve the quality of the work received, build systems that interface with crowd labor in real time, and conduct experiments to improve understanding of the differences between different sources of crowd work. The course will provide hands-on activities on each of these topics, and provide pointers to material that can provide more in depth information.},

abstract = {Smart cities leverage sensor technology to monitor urban spaces in real-time. Still, discrepancies in sensor data can lead to uncertainty about city conditions. Mobile crowdsourcing, where on-site individuals offer real-time details, is a potential solution. Yet it is unclear whether users would prefer to utilizing the mobile crowd on site to verify sensor data or to provide supplementary explanations for inconsistent sensor data. We conducted an online experiment involving 100 participants to explore this question. Our results revealed a negative correlation between perceived plausibility of sensor information and inclination to use mobile crowdsourcing for obtaining information. However, only around 80\% of participants relied on crowdsourcing when they felt the sensor information as implausible. Interestingly, even when participants believed the sensor data to be plausible, they sought to use crowdsourcing for further details half of the time. We also found that participants leaned more towards using the crowd for explanations (48\% and 49\% of instances) rather than seeking verification when encountering perceived implausible sensor information (38\% and 32\% of instances).},
