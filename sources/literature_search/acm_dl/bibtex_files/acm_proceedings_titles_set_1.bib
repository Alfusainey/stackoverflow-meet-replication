abstract = {This exploratory paper examines a tension between interacting and documenting as knowledge sharing tasks on Stack Overflow, a platform that supports informal learning at scale in the domain of programming. The study works with platform data in the form of the text of posts and accompanying metadata along with 16 interviews with users. Drawing on trace ethnography as an approach to maintaining an interpretive stance while combining several types of data, this preliminary analysis discusses two interrelated particularities of the tension. The discussion of these particularities, platform mechanics and competing temporalities, helps to unpack a tension that is both a phenomenon of analytic interest and a member's concern for users of the platform.},

abstract = {Many industries are facing the challenge of how to capture workers’ knowledge such that it can be shared, in particular tacit knowledge. The operation of complex systems such as a manufacturing line is knowledge-intensive, especially if the operator must frequently reconfigure it for different products. Considering the breadth and dynamic nature of this knowledge, existing solutions for sharing knowledge (e.g., word-of-mouth, issue reports, document creation, and decision support systems) are inefficient and/or resource-intensive. Conversational user interfaces are an efficient way to convey information that mimics the way humans share knowledge; however, we know little about how to design them specifically for this purpose, especially regarding tacit knowledge. In this work, my main goal is to investigate how a cognitive assistant can be designed to facilitate (tacit) knowledge transfer between users of dynamic complex systems. I aim to achieve this by outlining the design requirements, challenges, and opportunities in factories; by collaboratively designing, implementing, and evaluating a cognitive assistant for sharing knowledge; studying the effects of design characteristics on aspects such as user experience; and finally, creating a set of design guidelines.},

This means that people of different generations can increasingly learn together and share knowledge virtually in the digital age. Nevertheless, the principles for designing systems to support intergenerational knowledge sharing (IKS) are inconclusive. Our results demonstrate the value of applying design science research methodology to capture design principles for IKS systems. We articulate what design goals should be considered and bring more conceptual clarity to this phenomenon by presenting five design principles: a) positive personalization, b) progressive design ecosystem, c) effectual system design, d) iterative goal reflection, e) coopetitive intergenerational tasks. By reflecting on the design process and formalizing a class of design principles, we contribute to design-oriented IKS systems in the digital age.},

abstract = {Federated Learning (FL) protects privacy during autonomous vehicle machine learning (ML) operations. FL enables cooperative training of a single ML model across multiple edge devices, leveraging distributed datasets while maintaining data locality. Although much research has concentrated on single-server FL for autonomous driving applications within vehicular networks, real-world scenarios often involve several concurrent servers capable of benefiting from each other's knowledge. However, these servers' trustworthiness is paramount when using their global models, as an imprudent choice could significantly decrease FL performance and accuracy. In this paper, we introduce a novel trust-based knowledge-sharing approach among FL servers, wherein the accuracy of shared global models on clients' local data serves as the trust metric. Our proposed methodology enables servers to utilize shared global models from reliable servers for their clients, thereby improving training accuracy and reducing loss. This enhancement is particularly notable during the initial training rounds compared to base FL implementation.},

In the legal domain, there is a large knowledge gap between the experts and the searchers, and the content on the legal QA websites consist of a combination formal and informal communication. In this paper, we propose methods for generating query-dependent textual profiles for lawyers covering several aspects including sentiment, comments, and recency. We combine query-dependent profiles with existing expert finding methods. Our experiments are conducted on a novel dataset gathered from an online legal QA service. We discovered that taking into account different lawyer profile aspects improves the best baseline model. We make our dataset publicly available for future work.},

abstract = {Software developers often resort to Stack Overflow (SO) to fill their programming needs. Given the abundance of relevant posts, navigating them and comparing different solutions is tedious and time-consuming. Recent work has proposed to automatically summarize SO posts to concise text to facilitate the navigation of SO posts. However, these techniques rely only on information retrieval methods or heuristics for text summarization, which is insufficient to handle the ambiguity and sophistication of natural language.This paper presents a deep learning based framework called Assort for SO post summarization. Assort includes two complementary learning methods, AssortS and AssortIS, to address the lack of labeled training data for SO post summarization. AssortS is designed to directly train a novel ensemble learning model with BERT embeddings and domain-specific features to account for the unique characteristics of SO posts. By contrast, AssortIS is designed to reuse pre-trained models while addressing the domain shift challenge when no training data is present (i.e., zero-shot learning). Both AssortS and AssortIS outperform six existing techniques by at least 13\% and 7\% respectively in terms of the F1 score. Furthermore, a human study shows that participants significantly preferred summaries generated by AssortS and AssortIS over the best baseline, while the preference difference between AssortS and AssortIS was small.},

abstract = {Graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown their superiority in modeling graph data. Owing to the advantages of federated learning, federated graph learning (FGL) enables clients to train strong GNN models in a distributed manner without sharing their private data. A core challenge in federated systems is the non-IID problem, which also widely exists in real-world graph data. For example, local data of clients may come from diverse datasets or even domains, e.g., social networks and molecules, increasing the difficulty for FGL methods to capture commonly shared knowledge and learn a generalized encoder. From real-world graph datasets, we observe that some structural properties are shared by various domains, presenting great potential for sharing structural knowledge in FGL. Inspired by this, we propose FedStar, an FGL framework that extracts and shares the common underlying structure information for inter-graph federated learning tasks. To explicitly extract the structure information rather than encoding them along with the node features, we define structure embeddings and encode them with an independent structure encoder. Then, the structure encoder is shared across clients while the feature-based knowledge is learned in a personalized way, making FedStar capable of capturing more structure-based domain-invariant information and avoiding feature misalignment issues. We perform extensive experiments over both cross-dataset and cross-domain non-IID FGL settings, demonstrating the superiority of FedStar.},

However, three types of barriers between questioners and respondents make knowledge sharing difficult:differences in the personality types of the questioners and respondents, lack of trust, and an arrogant or negative attitude exhibited by some questioners. In order to lower these barriers, we propose a Q&amp;A mediator system with virtual character agents. In this system, a questioner asks questions through his/her own agent, and the respondents see the question from their agent. Each agent has four characteristics:personality traits similar to knowledge sharers, good looks, affable personality, and a positive attitude. The results of a preliminary experiment indicated that the proposed system can improve the users' motivation to answer questions.},

abstract = {This article examines the factors determining the quality of the outcomes of public-private IT outsourcing (ITO) to create public value. We elaborated a model based on the relational view of interorganizational relations, complemented by the theory of boundary objects. We provide an empirical validation of this model from a sample of IT managers in state and local governments in Mexico. We found that public-private ITO can generate public value thanks to a high quality of the information system produced in related projects. Information system quality is supported by effective knowledge sharing between project partners. The quality of knowledge sharing is expressed by the quality of the contract and other artifacts that facilitate building shared understanding and by conflict resolution processes developed during the partnership. The quality of knowledge sharing depends on the level of two trust-related dimensions: benevolence and competence between outsourcing partners. In our model, we relate in a novel way trust, knowledge sharing, the quality of IT services produced and public value in the context of public-private ITO. We also propose an original formulation and validation of knowledge sharing dimensions, looking at the importance of specific knowledge interfaces to bridge semantic and pragmatic boundaries in public-private ITO.},

abstract = {Learning from code written by other programmers is one of the most important ways of learning how to program. However, reading the code of a skilled programmer can be difficult for a beginner. Put differently, learning how to program can be challenging when the learners have different levels of programming proficiency. To lessen these difficulties, it is necessary to present model code that corresponds to the proficiency level of the learner. However, since proficiency levels in programming may vary by learner, preparing model code matching the proficiency level of every possible learner in advance may not always be practical. Therefore, we propose a platform for sharing knowledge among various learners participating in a given lecture. Functionality for sharing code alone may be insufficient for presenting code appropriate to the level of a given learner. Therefore, we also propose code quality indicators for understanding the degree of proximity in proficiency between a learner and a given programmer whose code is being used as a model. To this end, in this paper, we propose a platform with functionality for sharing, evaluating, and ranking written code. In addition, in order to understand the relationship between code written by other programmers and the behavior of the code at runtime, we propose a platform that involves programming a robot in order to allow the learner to visualize the behavior of the code as movement of the robot.},

In addition to offering students a space to ask questions, these forums aim to create a community and promote engagement. Prior literature suggests that the way students participate in Q&amp;A forums varies and that most students do not actively post questions or engage in discussions. Students may display different participation behaviours depending on their comfort levels in the class. This paper investigates students' use of a Q&amp;A forum in a CS1 course. We also analyze student opinions about the forum to explain the observed behaviour, focusing on students' lack of visible participation (lurking, anonymity, private posting). We analyzed forum data collected in a CS1 course across two consecutive years and invited students to complete a survey about perspectives on their forum usage. Despite a small cohort of highly engaged students, we confirmed that most students do not actively read or post on the forum. We discuss students' reasons for the low level of engagement and barriers to participating visibly. Common reasons include fearing a lack of knowledge and repercussions from being visible to the student community.},

abstract = {This paper deals with knowledge sharing during a collaborative and design-based research project about game-based learning. According to a literature review about serious game design, a key process for collaborative work is knowledge sharing. This process is analysed with the frames of praxeologies and boundary objects. The praxeology framework aims to identify the participants’ practice and discourse about this practice for the design of serious games. The boundary objects framework aims to identify knowledge transactions during collaborative work. We collected data from workshops dedicated to co-design of TSADK, a serious game for computer education. We performed a thematic analysis on participants’ verbatim for nine workshops. The thematic analysis focuses on one subject: the learning outcomes of the game. The analysis has identified themes on this subject: to specify, to phrase and to select the main learning outcomes. Regarding these themes, the praxeology and boundary object frameworks allow us to identify common practice but no common knowledge and thus, an obstacle to collaboration. Based on these results, we propose a tool for supporting the collaboration design through sharing knowledge.},

abstract = {Community Question Answering (CQA) websites are valuable knowledge repositories where individuals exchange information by asking and answering questions. With an ever-increasing number of questions and high in-flow and out-flow of users in these communities, a key challenge is to design effective strategies for recommending experts for new questions. This requires robust approaches that facilitate modeling users’ expertise given their changing interests and sparse historical data, at the same time being computationally less expensive for periodic updates. In this paper, we propose a simple graph diffusion-based expert recommendation model for CQA, that can outperform state-of-the-art convolutional neural network and transformers-based deep learning representatives and collaborative models. Our proposed method learns users’ expertise in the context of both semantic and temporal information to capture their changing interests and activity levels with time. Experiments on six real-world datasets from the Stack Exchange network demonstrate that our approach outperforms competitive baseline methods. Further, experiments on cold-start users (users with a limited historical record) show our model achieves an average of 50\% performance gain compared to the best baseline method.},

The safety of a scenario involving multiple intelligent vehicles and infrastructures depends on delicate design of their collaboration. A unified and efficient representation for knowledge sharing and fusion is essential for such collaboration. However, the existing logical representation of spatial knowledge seldom considers integrating the knowledge from distributed agents with different granularities of views and data models. This paper designs a novel spatial logic based on a hierarchical spatial model, and provides a knowledge fusion method based on view and grained conversion between distributed agents. The spatial logic can be used to specify and share the key spatial knowledge in vehicle infrastructure cooperation scenarios. The converted knowledge shared by other agents is beneficial for an intelligent vehicle to improve its cognition and decision-making process. The effectiveness of our approach is illustrated with the case studies in path planning and cooperative cross-traffic turning.},

abstract = {There are several barriers to the knowledge management process in the current technological market environment that can affect software quality, especially in a distributed environment. One of them relates to the knowledge sharing needed to fulfill required tasks to ensure the projects’ deliverables. This paper is an experience report that assesses the gaps of knowledge (GoK) in the project leaders (PL) team. To accomplish this, it was carried out documental analysis and focus group sessions to review essential activities developed by the PL team during the software development process. Afterward, we carried out a survey to verify the GoK of PL team members related to their ability to perform essential activities to develop Security Maintenance Release projects. This paper also shows analyzes of three ways to share knowledge and a training program guidelines to eliminate existing GoK in the PL team. The findings reveal that although many factors affect the success rates of the knowledge sharing process, a training plan considering the combination of four factors can shorten the learning curve of PL team members. We hope this paper can contribute helping other knowledge-based companies and scientific community to increase their competitive advantages related to the knowledge sharing process and to minimize software quality problems such as rework effort and defective product delivery.},

abstract = {Community question-answering (CQA) enables both information retrieval and social interactions. CQA questions are viewed as goal-expressions from the askers' perspectives. Most prior studies mainly focused on the goals expressed in the questions, but not on how responders' expectations and responses are influenced by the goal-expressions. To fill the gap, this research proposes the use of framing theory to understand how different expressions of goals influence responses. Cues of questions were used to identify goal-frames in CQA questions. Social network analysis was used to construct response networks whose nodes represent postings and connections represent responses. Our results reveal that goal-frames with high complexity, high specificity, and rewards tend to increase the centrality of questions. In contrast, low complexity and low specificity tend to generate extensive conversations. Implications for both researchers and practitioners are discussed in the final section.},

abstract = {In recent years, community Q&amp;A websites have attracted many users and have become reliable sources among experts from various fields. These platforms have specific rules to maintain their content quality in addition to general user agreements. Due to the vast expanse of these systems in terms of the number of users and posts, manual checking and verification of new contents by the administrators and official moderators are not feasible, and these systems require scalable solutions. In major Q&amp;A networks, the current strategy is to use crowdsourcing with reliance on reporting systems. This strategy has serious problems, including the slow handling of violations, the loss of new and experienced users’ time, the low quality of user reports, and discouraging feedback to new users. While this is a great opportunity to utilize machine-learning approaches to provide automated recommender systems and classification models, there are specific non-functional requirements or aspects related to these software systems that need to be introduced and incorporated in the design of a new system. In this short paper, I pinpoint three key aspects: (1) Any good approach should consider specific attributes and features related to context, (2) Automated mechanisms should be proposed according to the highly evolving content of Q&amp;A websites, and (3) Decisions are best to accompany clear and justifiable explanations. Furthermore, a technical conceptual model is proposed by considering these aspects and related approaches. This is a part of a research project where the final goal is to provide accurate, adaptable, efficient, and explainable solutions for automating moderation actions in Q&amp;A websites.},

abstract = {Developing interactive systems is a challenging task that involves concerns related to the human-computer interaction (HCI), such as usability and user experience. Therefore, HCI design is a core issue when developing such systems. It often involves people with different backgrounds (e.g., Arts, Software Engineering, Design), which makes knowledge transfer a challenging issue. Ontologies have been acknowledged as a successful approach to represent domain knowledge and support knowledge-based solutions. Hence, in this work, we propose to explore ontologies to represent structured knowledge and improve knowledge sharing in HCI design. We briefly present the Human-Computer Interaction Design Ontology (HCIDO), a reference ontology that addresses HCI design aspects that connect HCI and Software Engineering concerns. By making knowledge related to the HCI design domain explicit and structured, HCIDO has helped us to develop KTID, a tool that aims to support capturing and sharing useful knowledge to aid in HCI design. Preliminary results indicate that the tool may be particularly useful for novice HCI designers.},

Questionnaires were carried out to collect data from 565 participants. Descriptive statistics, correlation coefficients, and multiple linear regression were applied for the statistical analysis. In addition, t-tests were employed to compare the difference between generation Y and generation Z employees in relation to perceived organizational justice, innovative work behavior, and knowledge sharing. The results indicate that procedural justice, distributive justice, and spatial justice in the perceived organizational justice impacted directly on innovative work behavior at a significant level, while interactional justice impacted innovative work behavior through knowledge sharing as a mediator. However, procedural justice had no effect on innovative work behavior. Furthermore, generation Z's perceived organizational justice was higher than that of generation Y. For generation Z, knowledge sharing was higher than that of Generation Y at a significant level. On the other hand, generation Y's innovative working behavior was higher than that of generation Z. The study's findings can be used as guidance to improve workers' innovative work behavior in the organization.},

The proposed model is a combination of two parts that covers question-question similarity and question-answer relevance. We used twin ON-LSTM with an attention mechanism and Arabic ELMo embeddings as input for the question-question similarity. For the question-answer relevance, we used a combination of twin ON-LSTM and CNN networks which can capture the relevance score even with long answers and questions. We evaluated the proposed model on the biomedical Arabic community question answering dataset cQA-MD. The proposed model outperformed the previous studies evaluated on the same dataset.},

abstract = {Debugging can be challenging for novice and expert programmers alike. Programmers routinely turn to online resources such as Stack Overflow for help, but understanding of debugging search practices, as well as tool support to find debugging resources, remains limited. Existing tools that mine online help forums are generally not aimed at novices, and programmers face varying levels of success when looking for online resources. Furthermore, training online code search skills is pedagogically challenging, as we have little understanding of how expertise impacts programmers' web search behavior while debugging code.We help fill these knowledge gaps with the results of a study of 40 programmers investigating differences in Stack Overflow search behavior at three levels of expertise: novices, experienced programmers who are novices in Python (the language we use in our study), and experienced Python programmers. We observe significant differences between all three levels in their ability to find posts helpful for debugging a given error, with both general and language-specific expertise facilitating Stack Overflow search efficacy and debugging success. We also conduct an exploratory investigation of factors that correlate with this difference, such as the display rank of the selected link and the number of links checked per search query. We conclude with an analysis of how online search behavior and results vary by Python error type. Our findings can inform online code search pedagogy, as well as inform the development of future automated tools.},

In particular, we contribute: (1) an OpenConstruction Dataset with 31 unique object categories, integrating three large datasets for validating lifelong object detection algorithms; (2) an OpenConstruction Taxonomy, unifying heterogeneous label space from various scenarios; and (3) an informativeness-based lifelong object detector that leverages very limited examples from previous learning tasks and adds new data progressively. We train and evaluate the proposed method on the OpenConstruction Dataset in sequential data streams and show mAP improvements on the overall task. Code is available at .},

abstract = {In a competitive business environment, many companies struggle to align their resources to improve their performance. The resources should become one of the company's competitive advantage. One of those competitive advantages is knowledge assets. Knowledge assets can be developed by optimizing human resource management because not all companies want to invest funds to develop a knowledge management system. Initiation of knowledge sharing behavior among workforces is considered to be one of the most efficient ways. In Indonesia, it is predicted that 46\% of workforces in 2020 are millennials. Many previous studies have looked at millennial behavior in the work environment, and they are considered to potentially inhibit the development of the company's knowledge assets due to a high turnover rate. This paper is aimed to explore the factors that promote or discourage knowledge sharing behavior of millennials workforce. Factors studied included psychological, organizational culture, cognitive abilities, technological facilities, and so forth. The PLS method is used to explore these factors. A strategy has been developed as a recommendation for companies to initiate a knowledge sharing culture.},

abstract = {This paper proposes a system that facilitates knowledge sharing among people in similar situations by providing audio of past conversations. Our system records all voices of conversations among the users in the specific fields such as tourist spots, museums, digital fabrication studio, etc. and then timely provides users in a similar situation with fragments of the accumulated conversations. For segmenting and retrieving past conversation from vast amounts of captured data, we focus on non-verbal contextual information, i.e., location, attention targets, and hand operations of the conversation participants. All voices of conversation are recorded, without any selection or classification. The delivery of the voices to a user is determined not based on the content of the conversation but on the similarity of situations between the conversation participants and the user. To demonstrate the concept of the proposed system, we performed a series of experiments to observe changes in user behavior due to past conversations related to the situation at the digital fabrication workshop. Since we have not achieved a satisfactory implementation to sense user's situation, we used Wizard of Oz (WOZ) method. That is, the experimenter visually judges the change in the situation of the user and inputs it to the system, and the system automatically provides the users with voices of past conversation corresponding to the situation. Experimental results show that most of the conversations presented when the situation perfectly matches is related to the user's situation, and some of them prompts the user to change their behavior effectively. Interestingly, we could observe that conversations that were done in the same area but not related to the current task also had the effect of expanding the user's knowledge. We also observed a case that although a conversation highly related to the user's situation was timely presented but the user could not utilize the knowledge to solve the problem of the current task. It shows the limitation of our system, i.e., even if a knowledgeable conversation is timely provided, it is useless unless it fits with the user's knowledge level.},

abstract = {Stack Overflow is a popular platform for developers to seek solutions to programming-related problems. However, prior studies identified that developers may suffer from the redundant, useless, and incomplete information retrieved by the Stack Overflow search engine. To help developers better utilize the Stack Overflow knowledge, researchers proposed tools to summarize answers to a Stack Overflow question. However, existing tools use hand-craft features to assess the usefulness of each answer sentence and fail to remove semantically redundant information in the result. Besides, existing tools only focus on a certain programming language and cannot retrieve up-to-date new posted knowledge from Stack Overflow. In this paper, we propose TechSumBot, an automatic answer summary generation tool for a technical problem. Given a question, TechSumBot first retrieves answers using the Stack Overflow search engine, then TechSumBot 1) ranks each answers sentence based on the sentence's usefulness, 2) estimates the centrality of each sentence to all candidates, and 3) removes the semantic redundant information. Finally, TechSumBot returns the top 5 ranked answer sentences as the answer summary. We implement TechSumBot in the form of a search engine website. To evaluate TechSumBot in both automatic and manual manners, we construct the first Stack Overflow multi-answer summarization benchmark and design a manual evaluation study to assess the effectiveness of TechSumBot and state-of-the-art baselines from the NLP and SE domain. Both results indicate that the summaries generated by TechSumBot are more diverse, useful, and similar to the ground truth summaries.Tool Link: www.techsumbot.comVideo Link: https://youtube.coni/watch7v-ozuJOp_vILMReplication Package: https://github.com/TechSumBot/TechSumBot},

abstract = {Eldorado is an R&amp;D Institute responsible for OS customization for Android Smartphone Software worldwide. Eldorado is based in Brazil and works closely with other teams worldwide (China, United States, and India). Handling the project management considering this complex GSD scenario brings many challenges, one of them is the knowledge sharing on new development processes. As each region has its own set of procedures and specific carriers, the newcomers need to learn the new working processes. Even having a Wiki space to share information, the members report great difficulty using it, especially when they start to work on a project from a different region. For this reason, we developed a labeling-oriented project management approach based on identifying and defining project patterns. This experience report describes how we reduced the knowledge information required to manage a mobile software development process, the lessons learned applying the developed approach in mobile projects, and the future steps to improve it.},

Assuming this plurality of people, there are still few well-established techniques that provide manners on developing technologies capable of serving this public. In this way, the Stack Overflow was chosen for being an open and free platform worldwide that aims to add, from doubts, several answers related to web technologies, such as HTML and CSS. Mining its database known as SOTorrent, it was possible to verify whether the recommendations of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0, chosen for being more consolidated, are followed or not, besides possible violations. Since the results were taken in a total of 279 snippets that were checked, 597 failures according to WCAG were found, representing a lack of visibility on implementing accessible systems.},

abstract = {To solve programming issues, developers commonly search on Stack Overflow to seek potential solutions. However, there is a gap between the knowledge developers are interested in and the knowledge they are able to retrieve using search engines. To help developers efficiently retrieve relevant knowledge on Stack Overflow, prior studies proposed several techniques to reformulate queries and generate summarized answers. However, few studies performed a large-scale analysis using real-world search logs. In this paper, we characterize how developers search on Stack Overflow using such logs. By doing so, we identify the challenges developers face when searching on Stack Overflow and seek opportunities for the platform and researchers to help developers efficiently retrieve knowledge. To characterize search activities on Stack Overflow, we use search log data based on requests to Stack Overflow's web servers. We find that the most common search activity is reformulating the immediately preceding queries. Related work looked into query reformulations when using generic search engines and found 13 types of query reformulation strategies. Compared to their results, we observe that 71.78\% of the reformulations can be fitted into those reformulation strategies. In terms of how queries are structured, 17.41\% of the search sessions only search for fragments of source code artifacts (e.g., class and method names) without specifying the names of programming languages, libraries, or frameworks. Based on our findings, we provide actionable suggestions for Stack Overflow moderators and outline directions for future research. For example, we encourage Stack Overflow to set up a database that includes the relations between all computer programming terminologies shared on Stack Overflow, e.g., method name, data structure name, design pattern, and IDE name. By doing so, Stack Overflow could improve the performance of search engines by considering related programming terminologies at different levels of granularity.},

abstract = {Energy efficiency has become an important consideration in deep learning systems. However, it remains a largely under-emphasized aspect during the development. Despite the emergence of energy-efficient deep learning patterns, their adoption remains a challenge due to limited awareness. To address this gap, we present DENT (Deep Learning Energy Pattern Tagger, a Chrome extension used to add "energy pattern tags" to the deep learning related questions from Stack Overflow. The idea of DENT is to hint to the developers about the possible energy-saving opportunities associated with the Stack Overflow post through energy pattern labels. We hope this will increase awareness about energy patterns in deep learning and improve their adoption. A preliminary evaluation of DENT achieved an average precision of 0.74, recall of 0.66, and an F1-score of 0.65 with an accuracy of 66\%.

The specific model chosen in this research for knowledge sharing is the SECI Model. It used an experimental model combined with quantitative method. It used 92 respondents from several departments and second semester. It used questionnaires for SECI Model and Organizational Commitment, and they got &gt; 0.250 for corrected total item correlations and Cronbach alpha, so all the itmes in the questionnaires are valid and reliable. The respondents tend to choose the scale of 4 (46.965\% in average), 3 (26.855\% in average) and 5 (17.913\% in average). The correlations between organizational commitment and every process of SECI Model are 0.366, 0.270, 0.213 and 0.707. These results show that organizational commitment of the respondents have positive linear relationships with every process of SECI Model.},

As a result, several restaurants have been forced to close. Therefore, this study proposes a game system that applies the mechanism of the prediction market to solicit ideas from employees for recovery of sales in small restaurants and effective use of ingredients (including reduction of food waste) under the business scenario in COVID-19. In such a game, routine restaurant operations can be understood, current issues can be analyzed and the deductions from these can be used as a reference for subsequent business opportunities. The game will improve communication between owners and employees. Understanding the contents of food waste will be beneficial to employees and consumers.},

abstract = {A growing number of software-intensive systems are being accused of violating or ignoring human values (e.g., privacy, inclusion, and social responsibility), and this poses great difficulties to individuals and society. Such violations often occur due to the solutions employed and decisions made by developers of such systems that are misaligned with user values. Stack Overflow is the most popular Q&amp;A website among developers to share their issues, solutions (e.g., code snippets), and decisions during software development. We conducted an exploratory study to investigate the occurrence of human values violations in Stack Overflow posts. As comments under posts are often used to point out the possible issues and weaknesses of the posts, we analyzed 2,000 Stack Overflow comments and their corresponding posts (1,980 unique questions or answers) to identify the types of human values violations and the reactions of Stack Overflow users to such violations. Our study finds that 315 out of 2,000 comments contain concerns indicating their associated posts (313 unique posts) violate human values. Leveraging Schwartz’s theory of basic human values as the most widely used values model, we show that hedonism and benevolence are the most violated value categories. We also find the reaction of Stack Overflow commenters to perceived human values violations is very quick, yet the majority of posts (76.35\%) accused of human values violation do not get downvoted at all. Finally, we find that the original posters rarely react to the concerns of potential human values violations by editing their posts. At the same time, they usually are receptive when responding to these comments in follow-up comments of their own.},

abstract = {Knowing the topics of a software forum post, such as those on StackOverflow, allows for greater analysis and understanding of the large amounts of data that come from these communities. One approach to this problem is using extreme multi label classification (XMLC) to predict the topic (or "tag") of a post from a potentially very large candidate label set. While previous work has trained these models on data which has explicit text-to-tag information, we assess the classification ability of embedding models which have not been trained using such structured data (and are thus "unsupervised") to assess the potential applicability to other forums or domains in which tag data is not available.We evaluate 14 unsupervised pre-trained models on 0.1\% of all StackOverflow posts against all 61,662 possible StackOverflow tags. We find that an MPNet model trained partially on unlabelled StackExchange data (i.e. without tag data) achieves the highest score overall for this task, with a recall score of 0.161 R@1. These results inform which models are most appropriate for use in XMLC of StackOverflow posts when supervised training is not feasible. This offers insight into these models' applicability in similar but not identical domains, such as software product forums. These results suggest that training embedding models using in-domain title-body or question-answer pairs can create an effective zero-shot topic classifier for situations where no topic data is available.},

abstract = {Bike sharing is an increasingly popular part of urban transportation systems. Accurate demand prediction is the key to support timely re-balancing and ensure service efficiency. Most existing models of bike-sharing demand prediction are solely based on its own historical demand variation, essentially regarding bike sharing as a closed system and neglecting the interaction between different transport modes. This is particularly important because bike sharing is often used to complement travel through other modes (e.g., public transit). Despite some recent efforts, there is no existing method capable of leveraging spatiotemporal information from multiple modes with heterogeneous spatial units. To address this research gap, this study proposes a graph-based deep learning approach for bike sharing demand prediction (B-MRGNN) with multimodal historical data as input. The spatial dependencies across modes are encoded with multiple intra- and inter-modal graphs. A multi-relational graph neural network (MRGNN) is introduced to capture correlations between spatial units across modes, such as bike sharing stations, subway stations, or ride-hailing zones. Extensive experiments are conducted using real-world bike sharing, subway and ride-hailing data from New York City, and the results demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed approach compared to existing methods.},

abstract = {Stack Overflow (SO) platform has a huge dataset of questions and answers driven by interactions between users. But the count of unanswered questions is continuously rising, which is observed in various similar community Question \&amp; Answering platforms (Q&amp;A) such as Yahoo, Quora and so on. To address this issue, these communities have explored clustering mechanisms to answer unanswered questions using other answered questions in the same cluster, which could also improve the response time for new questions. It is here, we propose SOCluster, an approach and a tool to cluster SO questions using a graph-based clustering approach. We selected four datasets of 10k, 20k, 30k \&amp; 40k SO questions without code-snippets or images involved, and performed clustering on them. We have done a preliminary evaluation of our tool by analyzing the resultant clusters using the commonly used metrics of Silhouette coefficient, Calinkski-Harabasz Index, \&amp; Davies-Bouldin Index. We performed clustering for 8 different threshold similarity values and analyzed the intriguing trends reflected by the output clusters through the three evaluation metrics. At 90\% threshold similarity, it shows the best improvement for the three evaluation metrics on all four datasets. We further manually assessed the content in the clusters to confirm the similarity of elements in clusters. This revealed clusters to correspond to topics such as mouse over effect, speed optimisation, how to perform ‘some’ action in JavaScript, and so on. The source code and tool are available for download on Github at: https://github.com/rishalab/SOCluster, and the demo can be found here: https://youtu.be/Ewm-M_rg_x8.},

abstract = {Various data mining tasks have been proposed to study Community Question Answering (CQA) platforms like Stack Overflow. The relatedness between some of these tasks provides useful learning signals to each other via Multi-Task Learning (MTL). However, due to the high heterogeneity of these tasks, few existing works manage to jointly solve them in a unified framework. To tackle this challenge, we develop a multi-relational graph based MTL model called Heterogeneous Multi-Task Graph Isomorphism Network (HMTGIN) which efficiently solves heterogeneous CQA tasks. In each training forward pass, HMTGIN embeds the input CQA forum graph by an extension of Graph Isomorphism Network and skip connections. The embeddings are then shared across all task-specific output layers to compute respective losses. Moreover, two cross-task constraints based on the domain knowledge about tasks' relationships are used to regularize the joint learning. In the evaluation, the embeddings are shared among different task-specific output layers to make corresponding predictions. To the best of our knowledge, HMTGIN is the first MTL model capable of tackling CQA tasks from the aspect of multi-relational graphs. To evaluate HMTGIN's effectiveness, we build a novel large-scale multi-relational graph CQA dataset with over two million nodes from Stack Overflow. Extensive experiments show that: (1) HMTGIN is superior to all baselines on five tasks; (2) The proposed MTL strategy and cross-task constraints have substantial advantages.},

We present similarities and differences between code clones in general and code clones on SO and point to open questions that need to be addressed to be able to make data-informed decisions about how to properly handle clones on this important platform. We present results from a first preliminary investigation, indicating that clones on SO are common and diverse.

abstract = {Globalizations makes world become smaller. It is easier to interact, communicate, connect and create business with another people in over the world. This opportunity is frequently optimized by business stakeholders to build multinational corporations, corporations that have products and branches in other countries. Culture, language and geographically differences remain and become challenges to manage knowledge over the headquarter and branches, including how to share knowledge. They influence how multinational corporations should optimize and use technology for better knowledge sharing process so they can keep benefit advantages, can compete to their competitors, or even keep their business runs well. This paper will review, compare and analyze mechanism and technology usage of knowledge sharing for multinational corporations. The sample of multinational corporations used is multinational corporations from many different countries with different area or industry. This research will result most of the mechanism and technology used to support and facilitate the knowledge share mechanism in multinational corporations.},

abstract = {A large amount of rich data available in today’s world encounters a lot of opportunities to analyze the data and identify some valuable patterns from them. However, dealing with such data requires automated frameworks and knowledge of programming languages. The most common and widely used programming languages among developers are Java and Python, as evident from the queries and issues posted on Stack Overflow and GitHub. Despite the popularity of both Java and Python, the challenges in transitioning from one technology to another technology are hard for individuals and industries. In this paper, we aim to investigate similarities in the challenges faced by developers while dealing with both programming languages. To achieve this goal, we formulated two research questions (RQs) for understanding the topics and issues asked and faced by developers. We have also identified the temporal trend of asking new questions on Stack Overflow for Java and Python programming languages (PLs). Our results revealed the changing trend, from 2015 onwards, from Java to Python and inclined towards Python from the number of new posts on Stack Overflow. We analyzed 18,892 Stack Overflow questions related to Java and Python PLs and 42,674 issues from 22 different GitHub repositories, 11 for each PL. Our results indicate that questions asked on Stack Overflow are co-related to issues posted by developers on GitHub during real-time development for a respective PL.},

abstract = {During the last few years, Continuous Integration (CI) has become a common practice in open-source and industrial environments to reduce the scope for errors and increase the speed to market through the automated build and test processes. However, despite this wide adoption throughout the years, little is known about the challenges developers discuss. Analyzing the discussions of developers is required to understand what researchers, educators and practitioners should focus on, and how discussion communities can be helpful to shed the light on CI challenges. In this study, we examine Stack Overflow (SO), the most popular crowd-sourced forum, to understand the challenges developers face in the CI context. We collect a corpus of 27,728 CI-related developers posts from SO and analyze those posts through a mixed method with quantitative and qualitative analyzes. To study the trends of CI discussions, we investigated the metadata of CI questions, users and tags. Then, we extract the CI main topics using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) tuned with Genetic Algorithm (GA). Finally, we investigate the most popular and difficult topics faced by developers based on unanswered questions to get further insights into CI challenges. The LDA clustering reveals that developers face challenges with six main topics namely Build, Testing, Version Control, Configuration, Deployment, and CI Culture. Particularly, we found that the build topic is the most popular among the studied topics and that version control and testing topics are the most difficult for the SO community. Our study uncovers insights about CI challenges and adds evidence to existing knowledge about CI issues related especially to software build.},

However, sustainable development of the OHCs require continuous knowledge contributions from members, thus it is vital to explore the factors that impact knowledge sharing behavior from different angles. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and structural equation modelling (SEM) were used to test the hypotheses. We distributed the questionnaire via an online platform. There are 340 valid responses were collected and the questionnaire validity rate was 89.0\% (340/382). The results indicated that basic psychological need satisfaction has a positive effect on trust and sense of self-worth; trust has a positive effect on knowledge sharing behavior; sense of self-worth has a positive effect on knowledge sharing behavior.

abstract = {GPUs have cemented their position in computer systems, not restricted to graphics but also extensively used for general-purpose computing. With this comes a rapidly expanding population of developers using GPUs for programming. However, programming with GPUs is notoriously difficult due to their unique architecture and constant evolution. A large number of developers have encountered problems of one kind or another, and many of them have turned to Q&amp;A sites for help. Unfortunately, there has been no prior work to comprehensively study the topics discussed and challenges encountered by developers in GPU programming. To fill this knowledge gap, we conduct a comprehensive study to understand the topics and challenges of GPU programming using Stack Overflow. We collect 25,269 relevant posts from Stack Overflow, propose a novel approach that combines automatic techniques and manual thematic analysis to extract topics, and build a taxonomy of topics with detailed discussions of the popularity, difficulty, and changing trends of these topics. In addition, we analyzed relevant posts through extensive manual efforts to understand the challenges of each topic and to summarize them for future research.},

This study proposed a knowledge-sharing model to articulate insightful knowledge from scattered tacit and explicit knowledge by keep personal data and copyright. It performed Soft System Methodology to facilitate conceptualization process from founded problem until strategies formulation. It generated artifacts to clarify problems and elaborates their solutions. By decomposing the problems into fishbone analysis, this study has identified who are the involved stakeholders and how the knowledge management should run. It became root cause as baseline to conceptualize a knowledge sharing model among gig workers. As the result, this study delivered a knowledge sharing model which relied on point system to engage gig workers' participation to externalize their knowledge in knowledge repository and expert should validate them before knowledge storing. To achieve more qualified model, this study relied on validation by representative gig workers and platform applications. This model contributes to mediate knowledge circulation among gig workers by encourage their extrinsic motivation. Hence, it can deliver innovative solution to enhance digital business on modern society through gig worker empowerment.},

abstract = {Health data is considered to be sensitive and personal; both governments and software platforms have enacted specific measures to protect it. Consumer apps that collect health data are becoming more popular, but raise new privacy concerns as they collect unnecessary data, share it with third parties, and track users. However, developers of these apps are not necessarily knowingly endangering users’ privacy; some may simply face challenges working with health features. To scope these challenges, we qualitatively analyzed 269 privacy-related posts on Stack Overflow by developers of health apps for Android- and iOS-based systems. We found that health-specific access control structures (e.g., enhanced requirements for permissions and authentication) underlie several privacy-related challenges developers face. The specific nature of problems often differed between the platforms, for example additional verification steps for Android developers, or confusing feedback about incorrectly formulated permission scopes for iOS. Developers also face problems introduced by third-party libraries. Official documentation plays a key part in understanding privacy requirements, but in some cases, may itself cause confusion. We discuss implications of our findings and propose ways to improve developers’ experience of working with health-related features—and consequently to improve the privacy of their apps’ end users.},

abstract = {Collaborative development communities and knowledge sharing communities are highly correlated and mutually complementary. The knowledge sharing between these two types of open source communities can be very beneficial to both of them. However, it is a great challenge to automate this process. Current studies mainly focus on knowledge acquisition in one type of community, and few of them have tackle this problem efficiently. In this paper we take Android Issue Tracker and Stack Overflow as a case to study automatic knowledge sharing between them. We propose an automatic approach by integrating semantic similarity with temporal locality between Android issues and Stack Overdo posts to reveal the potential associations between them. Our approach exploits the rich semantics in fine-grained information of issues and posts for associations building, and explores the temporal correlations between issues and posts in-depth for associations ranking. Extensive experiments show that the precision of our approach reaches 54.82\% for top 10 recommendations when recommending Stack Overflow posts to Android issues, and 66.83\%in reverse. This is significantly higher than the state-of-the-art method.},

abstract = {Feature models are the "de facto" standard for variability modelling and are used in both academia and industry. The MODEVAR initiative tries to establish a common textual feature modelling language that can be used by different communities and can allow information sharing. Feature model related researches use different models for different purposes such as analysis, sampling, testing, debugging, teaching, etc. Those models are shared in private repositories and there is a risk that all that knowledge is spread across different platforms which hinder collaboration and knowledge reuse. In this paper, we propose a first working version of a new feature model repository that allows to centralise the knowledge generated in the community together with advanced capabilities such as DOI generation, an API, analysis reports, among others. Our solution is a front end interface that uses the popular open science repository Zenodo as an end point to materialise the storage of all the information. Zenodo is enhanced with characteristics that facilitate the management of the models. The idea of our repository is to provide existing but also new features that are not present in other repositories (e.g., SPLOT). We propose to populate our repository with all the existing models of many sources including SPLOT.},

While input from domain experts could offer valuable help, such input is often limited, expensive, and generally not in a form readily consumable by a model development pipeline. In this paper, we propose Ziva, a framework to guide domain experts in sharing essential domain knowledge to data scientists for building NLP models. With Ziva, experts are able to distill and share their domain knowledge using domain concept extractors and five types of label justification over a representative data sample. The design of Ziva is informed by preliminary interviews with data scientists, in order to understand current practices of domain knowledge acquisition process for ML development projects. To assess our design, we run a mix-method case-study to evaluate how Ziva can facilitate interaction between domain experts and data scientists. Our results highlight that (1) domain experts are able to use Ziva to provide rich domain knowledge, while maintaining low mental load and stress levels; and (2) data scientists find Ziva’s output helpful for learning essential information about the domain, offering scalability of information, and lowering the burden on domain experts to share knowledge. We conclude this work by experimenting with building NLP models using the Ziva output for our case study.},

abstract = {Reactive programming is a programming paradigm that enables systems to automatically react to changes in data or events in a responsive and asynchronous manner, leveraging the concept of streams. The adoption of reactive programming techniques has grown significantly, particularly in developing mobile applications that demand efficient frameworks for creating adaptable and scalable systems. An example of such a framework is Combine, introduced by Apple in 2019 for Swift application development on the iOS platform. A framework that is worth mentioning is Combine, which was introduced by Apple in 2019 for Swift application development on the iOS platform. However, transitioning from imperative to reactive paradigms presents complex challenges for developers. This study aims to address the research gap that exists in Swift Combine by identifying and understanding the key challenges faced by developers when adopting and using that framework. Using a data mining approach, we analyzed questions and accepted answers from Stack Overflow related to Combine usage. Employing topic modeling with Latent Dirichlet Allocation, our analysis revealed 14 topics related to Combine usage, highlighting the most relevant and challenging aspects. These findings provide valuable insights for developers learning or incorporating Combine into their applications and serve as a reference for future studies in the field.},

abstract = {Taking advantage of the rapid growth of community platforms, such as Yahoo Answers, Quora, etc., Community Question Answering (CQA) systems are developed to retrieve semantically equivalent questions when users raise a new query. A typical CQA system mainly consists of two key components, a retrieval model and a ranking model, to search for similar questions and select the most related, respectively. In this paper, we propose LARQ, Learning to Ask and Rewrite Questions, which is a novel sentence-level data augmentation method. Different from common lexical-level data augmentation progresses, we take advantage of the Question Generation (QG) model to obtain more accurate, diverse, and semantically-rich query examples. Since the queries differ greatly in a low-resource code-start scenario, incorporating the QG model as an augmentation to the indexed collection significantly improves the response rate of CQA systems. We incorporate LARQ in an online CQA system and the Bank Question (BQ) Corpus to evaluate the enhancements for both the retrieval process and the ranking model. Extensive experimental results show that the LARQ enhanced model significantly outperforms single BERT and XGBoost models, as well as a widely-used QG model (NQG).},

The main results of this study demonstrated significant positive correlations between relationship communication, trust, and knowledge sharing. Furthermore, this study identified interpersonal trust as playing an important role in mediating the relationship between task communication and knowledge sharing. However, only the rational aspect of trust has an impact, unlike that of the emotional aspect. Thus, only cognitive trust was found to be a mediator for knowledge sharing.

abstract = {This Innovate Practice Work-In-Progress paper describes a novel, knowledge sharing environment that addresses several current problems in technical education. This environment is called the Kista Mentorspace, and is hosted by the Swedish Royal Institute of Technology, KTH. Although the problems it deals with are many, this paper focuses on the following areas.1.How to provision applied learning and practice to support technical theory.2.How to do this in a way that shows convincing value from higher education institutions.3.How to extend this value and contribution in a very broad sense.The Mentorspace provisions applied learning and practice by combining students from different schools in order to share their knowledge with engineering students. Knowledge sharing leads to applied practice including tool use, but that aspect is secondary. The Mentorspace increases the value of engineering education by tying applied practice to local needs and opportunities for graduates within the community. To extend this value in a broad sense, the Mentorspace brings in business and community developers to add local economic and social factors to the engineering curriculum. Success of the space is measured through academic and personal accomplishment, and contribution to community and social development. Long term mentoring by all participants regardless of age or social position is a cornerstone of the Mentorspace.},

abstract = {Today, coding skills are among the most required competencies worldwide, often also for non-computer scientists. Because of this trend, community contribution-based, question-and-answer (Q&amp;A) platforms became prominent for finding the proper solution to all programming issues. Stack Overflow has been the most popular platform for technical-related questions for years. Still, recently, some programming-related subreddits of Reddit have become a standing stone for questions and discussions. This work investigates the developers’ behavior and community formation around the twenty most popular programming languages. We examined two consecutive years of programming-related questions from Stack Overflow and Reddit, performing a longitudinal study on users’ posting activity and their high-order interaction patterns abstracted via hypergraphs. Our analysis highlighted crucial differences in how these Q&amp;A platforms are utilized by their users. In line with previous literature, it emphasized the constant decline of Stack Overflow in favor of more community-friendly platforms, such as Reddit, which has been growing rapidly lately.},

abstract = {The way knowledge is shared online is now constantly transforming with the advancement of technology. It is becoming more difficult now to sustain student’s attention in online knowledge sharing environment. Students tend to lose their attention quickly and no motivation to participate in the discussion activities posted by the lecturers. The current interface design is lacking of motivation factor to sustain students’ participation in online knowledge sharing activities. This paper describes design criteria that apply self-determination theory to self-motivate students in online knowledge sharing activities. The design criteria comprises game and social design elements. There are some typical game design elements used in user interface design are such as the points, badges, leaderboard, level, challenge, reward, progression and etc. These game design elements are now widely used in gamification applications. It was found that those design elements can motivate the students in their online knowledge sharing participation. The aim this paper is to provide the design criteria for a motivating user interface design that can promote students’ motivation to share their knowledge online. Previous study had identified a set design criteria based on content validity analysis for designing a motivating user interface. These set of design criteria were designed in a prototype interface called i-Discuss. Our finding reveal that motivation can be designed in user interface for online knowledge sharing activities. Future study will be conducted to evaluate the designed prototype.},

abstract = {Extensive online knowledge sharing can be exploited to solve tasks better, faster and cheaper, and it garners considerable interest in institutional cooperation, learning communities, etc., while many technical problems, such as fair exchange in incentive design and security issues are waiting to be solved. Blockchain technique has high accountability and thus has potential to improve the transparency and security of knowledge sharing. In this paper, to address the above problems, first we propose a Reputation Based Knowledge Sharing system in blockchain, called RBKS. The aim of RBKS is to exploit the copyright protection of the knowledge owner using our proposed fine-grained access control system, and to achieve the paid-for content service which allows bystanders who are interested in the shared knowledge to pay a small fee for the access. Second, a reputation evaluation algorithm is introduced as the core of the incentive, and it may possibly be combined with stake in blockchain to form a hybrid stake for the RBKS system. Third, a blockchain and a trusted storage server are employed together for sharing and storing knowledge, and the main procedures are implemented with smart contract in blockchain to ensure secure execution and fairness. Finally, our analysis shows that the RBKS system is feasible and secure.},

However, oftentimes submitted questions are unclear and cannot be answered without further clarification questions by expert community members. This study is the first to investigate the complex task of classifying a question as clear or unclear, i.e., if it requires further clarification. We construct a novel dataset and propose a classification approach that is based on the notion of similar questions. This approach is compared to state-of-the-art text classification baselines. Our main finding is that the similar questions approach is a viable alternative that can be used as a stepping stone towards the development of supportive user interfaces for question formulation.},

abstract = {Historically, mailing lists have been the preferred means for coordinating development and user support activities. With the emergence and popularity growth of social Q&amp;A sites such as the StackExchange network (e.g., StackOverflow), this is beginning to change. Such sites offer different socio-technical incentives to their participants than mailing lists do, e.g., rich web environments to store and manage content collaboratively, or a place to showcase their knowledge and expertise more vividly to peers or potential recruiters. A key difference between StackExchange and mailing lists is gamification, i.e., StackExchange participants compete to obtain reputation points and badges. In this paper, we use a case study of R (a widely-used tool for data analysis) to investigate how mailing list participation has evolved since the launch of StackExchange. Our main contribution is the assembly of a joint data set from the two sources, in which participants in both the texttt{r-help} mailing list and StackExchange are identifiable. This permits their activities to be linked across the two resources and also over time. With this data set we found that user support activities show a strong shift away from texttt{r-help}. In particular, mailing list experts are migrating to StackExchange, where their behaviour is different. First, participants active both on texttt{r-help} and on StackExchange are more active than those who focus exclusively on only one of the two. Second, they provide faster answers on StackExchange than on texttt{r-help}, suggesting they are motivated by the emph{gamified} environment. To our knowledge, our study is the first to directly chart the changes in behaviour of specific contributors as they migrate into gamified environments, and has important implications for knowledge management in software engineering.},

abstract = {As one of the most well-known programmer Q&amp;A websites, Stack Overflow (i.e., SO) is serving tens of thousands of developers every day. Previous work has shown that many developers reuse the code snippets on SO when they find an answer (from SO) that functionally matches the programming problem they encounter in their development activities. To study how programmers reuse code on SO during project development, we conduct a comprehensive empirical study. First, to capture the development activities of programmers, we collect 342,148 modified code snippets in commits from 793 open-source Java projects, and these modified code can reflect the programming problems encountered during development. We also collect the code snippets from 1,355,617 posts on SO. Then, we employ CCFinder to detect the code clone between the modified code from commits and the code from SO, and further analyze the code reuse when programmer solves a programming problem during development. We count the code reuse ratios of the modified code snippets in the commits of each project in different years, the results show that the average code reuse ratio is 6.32\%, and the maximum is 8.38\%. The code reuse ratio in project commits has increased year by year, and the proportion of code reuse in the newly established project is higher than that of old projects. We also find that some projects reuse the code snippets from many years ago. Additionally, we find that experienced developers seem to be more likely to reuse the knowledge on SO. Moreover, we find that the code reuse ratio in bug-related commits (6.67\%) is slightly higher than that of in non-bug-related commits (6.59\%). Furthermore, we also find that the code reuse ratio (14.44\%) in Java class files that have undergone multiple modifications is more than double the overall code reuse ratio (6.32\%).},

abstract = {Firebase is the leading Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) solution in the application development industry. It is globally used by millions of mobile applications and websites. Being a very popular and robust development platform, Firebase has introduced and developed many features and components over the years. Various services and modules are being added to the platform. So, the developers who use Firebase in their applications, need to have versatile knowledge of the platform. It is difficult to acquire an overview of the trends and discussions of any vast and dynamic platform such as Firebase. Therefore, learners, enthusiasts, and often developers have to put in a lot of effort to figure out topics they should explore and focus on. As a large number of application developers frequently use it and engage in various discussions about it in popular community discussion forums for developers, it has become a very promising source for identifying the topics and trends related to Firebase. Stack Overflow is the most popular community for developers’ discussions. It has grown to be a vast ocean of knowledge to explore. In this study, a systematic approach is followed to explore, extract, and analyze Stack Overflow discussions on Firebase to present an overview of the platform. Natural language processing and machine learning methods were used for extracting information from Stack Overflow data. Information collected was reviewed, analyzed, and compiled into this paper by the research group who have practical experiences in the Firebase platform and other relevant software engineering fields.},

abstract = {As reaction to globalization and the loosing of landmark caused by the huge data and information availability in the “net” and by the mass media proliferation, the research of an identity and the need of a feeling of belonging is stronger and stronger in today society. The information and communication technologies (ICT’s) - which initially helped to erase socio-territorial boundaries and to strengthen a feeling of belonging to a single community in which we are all interlinked and interdependent – have now become the main tools for building local, and smart, communities. These, in addition to being places of confrontation, are also and above all places for sharing subjective and objective knowledge (and therefore for continuous learning). There are several experiences going towards this direction (i.e. creating shared spaces built around shared values that emerge to deal with problems felt as “public”) ranging from analytical, investigative, critical and vindictive dimensions to proposals, monitoring, evaluation, deliberation, on the most varied topics: from the abandonment of public buildings (such as confiscated property), to security and the protection of territories. These are thus defined spaces in which, through self-organization and civic hacking dynamics, problems that are perceived as public are discussed and public goods are co-produced. These last are intended not as goods produced or owned by a public administration, but as the result of a process of social interaction. Digital technologies in this contest are tools by which social practices of re-appropriation and collective redefinition of public goods are nourished.},

abstract = {Communication between a software development team and business partners is often a challenging task due to the different context of terms used in the information exchange. The various contexts in which the concepts are defined or used create slightly different semantic fields that can evolve into information and communication silos. Due to the silo effect, the necessary information is often inadequately forwarded to developers resulting in poorly specified software requirements or misinterpreted user feedback. Communication difficulties can be reduced by introducing a mapping between the semantic fields of the parties involved in the communication based on the commonly used terminologies. Our research aims to obtain a suitable semantic database in the form of a semantic network built from the Stack Overflow corpus, which can be considered to encompass the common tacit knowledge of the software development community. Terminologies used in the business world can be assigned to our semantic network, so software developers do not miss features that are not specific to their world but relevant to their clients. We present an initial experiment of mining semantic network from Stack Overflow and provide insights of the newly captured relations compared to WordNet.},

Using the knowledge-sharing success model, thematic analysis of semi structured interview data from twenty-one IT staff representing both the consumer and the IT services provider reveals three main interrelated knowledge-sharing challenges areas: service delivery quality, information sharing, and communication. The study extends upon the existing knowledge-sharing success model by including the role of management support in managing knowledge sharing challenges effectively. Future research should investigate the impact of service delivery quality, information sharing, and communication challenges in other types of IT outsourcing relationships.},

abstract = {We perform cross-lingual question retrieval in community question answering (cQA), i.e., we retrieve similar questions for queries that are given in another language. The standard approach to cross-lingual information retrieval, which is to automatically translate the query to the target language and continue with a monolingual retrieval model, typically falls short in cQA due to translation errors. This is even more the case for specialized domains such as in technical cQA, which we explore in this work. To remedy, we propose two extensions to this approach that improve cross-lingual question retrieval: (1) we enhance an NMT model with monolingual cQA data to improve the translation quality, and (2) we improve the robustness of a state-of-the-art neural question retrieval model to common translation errors by adding back-translations during training. Our results show that we achieve substantial improvements over the baseline approach and considerably close the gap to a setup where we have access to an external commercial machine translation service (i.e., Google Translate), which is often not the case in many practical scenarios. Our source code and data is publicly available.1},

abstract = {Community Question Answering (cQA) are platforms where users can post their questions, expecting for other users to provide them with answers. We focus on the task of question retrieval in cQA which aims to retrieve previous questions that are similar to new queries. The past answers related to the similar questions can be therefore used to respond to the new queries. The major challenges in this task are the shortness of the questions and the word mismatch problem as users can formulate the same query using different wording. Although question retrieval has been widely studied over the years, it has received less attention in Arabic and still requires a non trivial endeavour. In this paper, we focus on this task both in Arabic and English. We propose to use word embeddings, which can capture semantic and syntactic information from contexts, to vectorize the questions. In order to get longer sequences, questions are expanded with words having close word vectors. The embedding vectors are fed into the Siamese LSTM model to consider the global context of questions. The similarity between the questions is measured using the Manhattan distance. Experiments on real world Yahoo! Answers dataset show the efficiency of the method in Arabic and English.},

abstract = {Community question answering (cQA) systems have enjoyed the benefits of advances in neural information retrieval, some models of which need annotated documents as supervised data. However, in contrast with the amount of supervised data for cQA systems, user-generated data in cQA sites have been increasing greatly with time. Thus, focusing on unsupervised models, we tackle a task of retrieving relevant answers for new questions from existing cQA data and propose two frameworks to exploit a Question Retrieval (QR) model for Answer Retrieval (AR). The first framework ranks answers according to the combined scores of QR and AR models and the second framework ranks answers using the scores of a QR model and best answer flags. In our experiments, we applied the combination of our proposed frameworks and a classical fusion technique to AR models with a Japanese cQA data set containing approximately 9.4M question-answer pairs. When best answer flags in the cQA data cannot be utilized, our combination of AR and QR scores with data fusion outperforms a base AR model on average. When best answer flags can be utilized, the retrieval performance can be improved further. While our results lack statistical significance, we discuss effect sizes as well as future sample sizes to attain sufficient statistical power.},

The posts' questions and titles are pre-processed, and the sentences in the posts are further transformed into features via Latent Dirichlet Allocation. The problem is a multi-class and multi-label classification and hence, we propose 1) one-against-all models for 15 most popularly used tags, and 2) a combined multi-tag classifier for finding the top K tags for a single post. Three algorithms are used to train the one-against-all classifiers to decide to what extent a post belongs to a tag. The probabilities of each post belonging to a tag are then combined to give the results of the multi-tag classifier with the best performing algorithm. The performance is compared with a baseline approach (kNN). Our multi-tag classifier achieves 55\% recall and 39\% F1-score.},

We therefore explore an automatic evaluation method for reused answer retrieval, which computes nDCG by defining the gain value of each retrieved answer as a ROUGE score that treats the original answers to q as gold summaries. Our answer retrieval experiment suggests that effective reused answer retrieval systems may not be the same as effective gold answer retrieval systems.

Identified topics include privacy policies, privacy concerns, access control, and version changes. Results show that developers do ask SO for support on privacy-related issues. We also find that platforms such as Apple and Google are defining privacy requirements for developers by specifying what "sensitive" information is and what types of information developers need to communicate to users (e.g. privacy policies). We also examine the accepted answers in our sample and find that 28\% of them link to official documentation and more than half are answered by SO users without references to any external resources.},

abstract = {Expert finding is a task designed to enable recommendation of the right person who can provide high-quality answers to a requester's question. Most previous works try to involve a content-based recommendation, which only superficially comprehends the relevance between a requester's question and the expertise of candidate experts by exploring the content or topic similarity between the requester's question and the candidate experts' historical answers. However, if a candidate expert has never answered a question similar to the requester's question, then existing methods have difficulty making a correct recommendation. Therefore, exploring the implicit relevance between a requester's question and a candidate expert's historical records by perception and reasoning should be taken into consideration. In this study, we propose a novel textslrecurrent memory reasoning network (RMRN) to perform this task. This method focuses on different parts of a question, and accordingly retrieves information from the histories of the candidate expert.Since only a small percentage of historical records are relevant to any requester's question, we introduce a Gumbel-Softmax-based mechanism to select relevant historical records from candidate experts' answering histories. To evaluate the proposed method, we constructed two large-scale datasets drawn from Stack Overflow and Yahoo! Answer. Experimental results on the constructed datasets demonstrate that the proposed method could achieve better performance than existing state-of-the-art methods.},

abstract = {We propose an innovative approach to finding experts for community question answering (CQA). The idea is to recommend answerers, who are credited the highest expertise under question tags at routing time. The expertise of answerers under already replied question tags is intuitively discounted by accounting for the observed tags, votes and temporal information of their answers. Instead, the discounted expertise under not yet replied tags is predicted via a latent-factor representation of both answerers and tags. These representations are inferred by means of Gibbs sampling under a new Bayesian probabilistic model of discounted user expertise and asking-answering behavior. The devised model unprecedentedly explains the latter two CQA aspects as the result of a generative process, that seamlessly integrates probabilistic matrix factorization and network behavior characterization. An extensive comparative experimentation over real-world CQA data demonstrates that our approach outperforms several-state-of-the-art competitors in recommendation effectiveness.},

With the rise of mobile short video, most mobile users will watch short video in their spare time. This paper combines micro video and knowledge sharing, and constructs a knowledge sharing platform based on micro video, where users can use short micro video to share knowledge and learn knowledge. In this paper, firstly, the knowledge sharing mode based on micro video is constructed, the user integration system is implemented, and the mode of user internal evaluation video is designed. Secondly, the requirements of the platform are defined and analyzed. Finally, the logic model of the platform is designed, and the overall design and detailed design scheme are proposed. The construction of this platform promotes the further development of mobile learning, which is conducive to users' autonomous and fragmented learning anytime and anywhere.},

abstract = {Communities of Question Answering (CQAs) are rapidly growing communities for exchanging information in the form of questions and answers. They rely on the contributions of users (i.e., members of the community) who have appropriate domain knowledge and can provide helpful answers. In order to deliver the most appropriate and valuable answers, identification of such users (experts) is critically important. However, a common problem faced in CQAs is that of poor expertise matching, i.e., routing of questions to inappropriate users. In this paper, we focus on Stack Overflow (a programming CQA) and address this problem by proposing an embedding based approach that integrates users’ textual content obtained from the community (e.g., answers) and community feedback in a unified framework. Our embedding-based approach is used to find the best relevant users for a given question by computing the similarity between questions and our user expertise representation. Then, our framework exploits feedback from the community to rank the relevant users according to their expertise. We experimentally evaluate the performance of the proposed approach using Stack Overflow’s dataset, compare it with state-of-the-art models and demonstrate that it can produce better results than the alternative models.},

These web-portals whereas identified successful in communicating with the stakeholders also played a vital role in sharing and managing knowledge. Based on this notion, this article is concerned with the role of e-government portal in sharing knowledge and the way through which this portal increases the efficiency of entire public sector. In the same instance, the K-ACT model of internet portal is analyzed to identify the features that make a web-portal best and perfect. In this article, we conducted a literature review and focused our attention on analyzing the e-government portals of four countries i.e. China, Hong Kong, Beijing and Turkish Municipalities. For the analysis and comparison purposes, the checklist of K-ACT model is used. The findings revealed that the e-government portal of these countries is not fully matched with the features as described in K-ACT, which ultimately affect the knowledge management and sharing practices in the region. Therefore, recommendations are made to improve the existing portal for knowledge sharing so that citizens can take more knowledge benefits from the e-government portals.},

abstract = {With the rapid development of the Internet, community question answering (CQA) platforms have attracted increasing attention over recent years, particularly in the biomedical field. On biomedical CQA platforms, patients share information about diseases, drugs and symptoms by communicating with each other. Therefore, the biomedical CQA platforms become particularly valuable resources for information and knowledge acquisition of patients. To accurately acquire relevant information, question answering techniques have been introduced in biomedical CQA. However, existing approaches cannot achieve the ideal performance due to the domain-specific characteristics. For example, biomedical CQA involves more complex interactive information between askers and answerers, while CQA techniques designed for the general field can only deal with single interactions between questions and candidate answers within a similar topic. To address the problem, we propose a novel neural network model for biomedical CQA. Our model adopts the bidirectional capsule network to focus on different aspects of biomedical questions and candidate answers, and merges high-level vector representations of questions and answers to capture abundant semantic information. Furthermore, to capture the meaning of Chinese characters, we incorporate the radical of Chinese characters embedding as auxiliary information to improve the performance of Chinese biomedical CQA. We conduct extensive experiments, and demonstrate that our model achieves significant improvement on the performance of answer selection in the Chinese biomedical CQA task.},

abstract = {Many novice programmers visit Stack Overflow for purposes that include posing questions and finding answers for issues they come across in the process of programming. Many questions have more than one correct answer on Stack Overflow, which are accompanied by number of comments from the users. Comments help developers in identifying the answer that better fits their purpose. However, it is difficult to navigate through all the comments to select an answer. Adding relevant visual cues to comments could help developers in prioritizing the comments to be read. Comments logged generally include sentiments of users, which, when depicted visually, could motivate users in reading through the comments and also help them in prioritizing the comments. However, the sentiment of comments is not being explicitly depicted on the current Stack Overflow platform. While there exist many tools that augment or annotate Stack Overflow platform for developers, we are not aware of tools that annotate visual representations of sentiments to the posts. In this paper, we propose StackEmo as a Google Chrome plugin to augment comments on Stack Overflow with emojis, based on the sentiment of the comments posted. We evaluated StackEmo through an in-user likert scale based survey with 30 university students to understand user perception towards StackEmo. The results of the survey provided us insights on improving StackEmo, with 83\% of the participants willing to recommend the plugin to their peers. The source code and tool are available for download on GitHub at: https://github.com/rishalab/StackEmo, and the demo can be found here on youtube: https://youtu.be/BCFlqvMhTMA.},

abstract = {Software developers often submit questions to technical Q&amp;A sites like Stack Overflow (SO) to resolve their code-level problems. Usually, they include example code segments with their questions to explain the programming issues. When users of SO attempt to answer the questions, they prefer to reproduce the issues reported in questions using the given code segments. However, such code segments could not always reproduce the issues due to several unmet challenges (e.g., too short code segment) that might prevent questions from receiving appropriate and prompt solutions. A previous study produced a catalog of potential challenges that hinder the reproducibility of issues reported at SO questions. However, it is unknown how the practitioners (i.e., developers) perceive the challenge catalog. Understanding the developers’ perspective is inevitable to introduce interactive tool support that promotes reproducibility. We thus attempt to understand developers’ perspectives by surveying 53 users of SO. In particular, we attempt to – (1) see developers’ viewpoints on the agreement to those challenges, (2) find the potential impact of those challenges, (3) see how developers address them, and (4) determine and prioritize tool support needs. Survey results show that about 90\% of participants agree to the already exposed challenges. However, they report some additional challenges (e.g., error log missing) that might prevent reproducibility. According to the participants, too short code segment and absence of required Class/Interface/Method from code segments severely prevent reproducibility, followed by missing important part of code. To promote reproducibility, participants strongly recommend introducing tool support that interacts with question submitters with suggestions for improving the code segments if the given code segments fail to reproduce the issues.},

abstract = {Incentives to encourage knowledge sharing have received considerable attention from the research community. However, consensus on the influence of incentives on sharing levels and what are the critical success factors is yet to emerge. This causes challenges for both knowledge management researchers and practitioners, as the effects of incentive systems cannot be predicted consistently. Hence, this article aims to discuss the critical factors for creating incentive systems to encourage sharing. To improve the prediction accuracy for such systems, a new framework is proposed. The proposed framework is a combination of sociological and economical approaches, which covers both the influence incentives and the relational factors that govern the behaviour of individuals in any given relationship. Analysis of a case study base on the proposed framework is then compared to two alternative frameworks approaches to incentive design. The comparison between the predictions made by the three theories shows that the prediction power and that the critical factors for designing incentives varies significantly. Therefore, when managers design new incentive structures to encourage knowledge sharing, they need to consider which theory captures their hidden assumptions and the presented situation's foundations most accurately. Finally future research directions are suggested based on the predictions made with the framework are proposed.},

In order to understand how the ratings of knowledge contribution quality correlate with the way knowledge is being shared in discussion threads, the study examines user behaviors and profiles in a large knowledge sharing community, /r/Techsupport, a discussion based Q&amp;A site in Reddit.com concerning internet and technology problems. Negative binomial regressions and negative binomial mixed models are built to investigate the relationships among thread structure, level of user activity, user profiles and the ratings of threads and comments in the community. Results indicate that in the better rated threads, the structures tend to be more centralized with heterogeneous participants discussing the problem at a deeper level. Meanwhile, contributions with good ratings are more likely to be produced by users who are more engaged in commenting behaviors.},

abstract = {Knowledge sharing communities, such as Wikipedia or Yahoo! Answers, add greatly to the wealth of information available on the Web. They represent complex social ecosystems that rely on user paricipation and the quality of users' contributions to prosper. However, quality is harder to achieve when knowledge sharing is facilitated through a high degree of personal interactions. The individuals' objectives may change from knowledge sharing to socializing, with a profound impact on the community and the value it delivers to the broader population of Web users. In this paper we provide new insights into the types of content that is shared through Community Question Answering (CQA) services. We demonstrate an approach that combines in-depth content analysis with social network analysis techniques. We adapted the Undirected Inductive Coding method to analyze samples of user questions and arrive at a comprehensive typology of the user intent. In our analysis we focused on two types of intent, social vs. non-social, and define measures of social engagement to characterize the users' participation and content contributions. Our approach is applicable to a broad class of online communities and can be used to monitor the dynamics of community ecosystems.},

abstract = {Social community question answering (SCQA) sites not only provide regular question answering (QA) service but also form a social network where users can follow each other. Identifying topical opinion leaders who are both expert and influential in SCQA becomes a hot research topic. However, existing works focus on either using knowledge expertise to find experts for improving the quality of answers, or measuring user influence to identify influential ones. In this paper, we propose QALeaderRank, a topical opinion leader identification framework, incorporating both the topic-sensitive influence and the topical knowledge expertise. To measure a user’s topic-sensitive influence, we design a novel ranking algorithm that exploits both the social and QA features of SCQA, taking account of the network structure, topical similarity and knowledge authority. Besides, we incorporate three topic-relevant metrics to infer the topical expertise. Extensive experiments along with a user study demonstrate that QALeaderRank outperforms the compared state-of-the-art methods. QALeaderRank can also be used to identify multi-topic opinion leaders.},

abstract = {Online questioning and answering (Q&amp;A) communities have become an essential social media platform for individuals to exchange specialized knowledge and collaboratively solve problems. Various gamified design elements (such as reputation scores, badges, levels, and leaderboards, etc.) have been applied in online Q&amp;A communities to motivate users’ knowledge contribution on which the sustainability of such communities depends. Current studies generally assume that motivational sources originate directly from the gamified elements. From the perspective of social comparison theory, this research proposes that the motivational affordances motivating knowledge contribution in online communities can be activated from the comparison of virtual rewards offered by gamified design features. Thus, the effect of gamified elements on a user’s behavior is determined, at least partially, by the social influence of how other users in the community are rewarded by the gamification mechanism. This research contributes to theory by providing a new perspective for understanding the effect of gamification on knowledge contribution in online Q&amp;A communities. It also provides important practical implications for the design and management of sustainable online communities.},

abstract = {Background: Q&amp;A sites allow to study how users reference and request support on technical debt. To date only few studies, focusing on narrow aspects, investigate technical debt on Stack Overflow. Aims: We aim at gaining an in-depth understanding on the characteristics of technical debt questions on Stack Overflow. In addition, we assess if identification strategies based on machine learning can be used to automatically identify and classify technical debt questions. Method: We use automated and manual processes to identify technical debt questions on Stack Overflow. The final set of 415 questions is analyzed to study (i) technical debt types, (ii) question length, (iii) perceived urgency, (iv) sentiment, and (v) themes. Natural language processing and machine learning techniques are used to assess if questions can be identified and classified&nbsp;automatically. Results: Architecture debt is the most recurring debt type, followed by code and design debt. Most questions display mild urgency, with frequency of higher urgency steadily declining as urgency rises. Question length varies across debt types. Sentiment is mostly neutral. 29 recurrent themes emerge. Machine learning can be used to identify technical debt questions and binary urgency, but not debt types. Conclusions: Different patterns emerge from the analysis of technical debt questions on Stack Overflow. The results provide further insights on the phenomenon, and support the adoption of a more comprehensive strategy to identify technical debt questions.},

To this end, we designed a chatbot for residents of a co-living space based on the following principles: (1) The range of shared information is limited to three areas derived from the similarities of the residents, and it takes a ‘give-and-take QnA’ structure, where one should answer a question from another resident after they ask a question. (2) Conversation is designed to resemble a human-like dialogue to reveal the presence of other residents. 19 residents of a co-living space used the chatbot for a week through the Wizard of Oz method, and six participants were asked about their chatbot experience through a semi-structured interview after the usage. A total of 58 interactions occurred, and the reply rate of the chatbot's question was 76\%. The interview revealed that the users were satisfied with chatbot's provision of information that could only be given by fellow residents, and the chatbot increased the presence of other residents, creating a feeling of social connection. We conclude the paper by proposing design principles for chatbots in collective housing.},

abstract = {Background: Code smells indicate potential design or implementation problems that may have a negative impact on programs. Similar to other software artefacts, developers use Stack Overflow (SO) to ask questions about code smells. However, given the high number of questions asked on the platform, and the limitations of the default tagging system, it takes significant effort to extract knowledge about code smells by means of manual approaches. Aim: We utilized supervised machine learning techniques to automatically identify code-smell discussions from SO posts. Method: We conducted an experiment using a manually labeled dataset that contains 3000 code-smell and 3000 non-code-smell posts to evaluate the performance of different classifiers when automatically identifying code smell discussions. Results: Our results show that Logistic Regression (LR) with parameter C=20 (inverse of regularization strength) and Bag of Words (BoW) feature extraction technique achieved the best performance amongst the algorithms we evaluated with a precision of 0.978, a recall of 0.965, and an F1-score of 0.971. Conclusion: Our results show that machine learning approach can effectively locate code-smell posts even if posts' title and/or tags cannot be of help. The technique can be used to extract code smell discussions from other textual artefacts (e.g., code reviews), and promisingly to extract SO discussions of other topics.},

abstract = {Online Q&amp;A fora such as Stack Overflow assist developers to solve their faced coding problems. Despite the advantages, Stack Overflow has the potential to provide insecure code snippets that, if reused, can compromise the security of the entire software. We present Dicos, an accurate approach by examining the change history of Stack Overflow posts for discovering insecure code snippets. When a security issue was detected in a post, the insecure code is fixed to be safe through user discussions, leaving a change history. Inspired by this process, Dicos first extracts the change history from the Stack Overflow post, and then analyzes the history whether it contains security patches, by utilizing pre-selected features that can effectively identify security patches. Finally, when such changes are detected, Dicos determines that the code snippet before applying the security patch is insecure. To evaluate Dicos, we collected 1,958,283 Stack Overflow posts tagged with C, C++, and Android. When we applied Dicos on the collected posts, Dicos discovered 12,458 insecure posts (i.e., 14,719 insecure code snippets) from the collected posts with 91\% precision and 93\% recall. We further confirmed that the latest versions of 151 out of 2,000 popular C/C++ open-source software contain at least one insecure code snippet taken from Stack Overflow, being discovered by Dicos. Our proposed approach, Dicos, can contribute to preventing further propagation of insecure codes and thus creating a safe code reuse environment.},

However, previous work has shown that code on SO may have quality issues, such as security or license problems.We analyse Python code on SO to determine its coding style compliance. From 1,962,535 code snippets tagged with 'python', we extracted 407,097 snippets of at least 6 statements of Python code. Surprisingly, 93.87\% of the extracted snippets contain style violations, with an average of 0.7 violations per statement and a huge number of snippets with a considerably higher ratio. Researchers and developers should, therefore, be aware that code snippets on SO may not representative of good coding style.Furthermore, while user reputation seems to be unrelated to coding style compliance, for posts with vote scores in the range between -10 and 20, we found a strong correlation (r = -0.87, p &lt; 10-7) between the vote score a post received and the average number of violations per statement for snippets in such posts.},

abstract = {Stack Overflow is one of the largest and most popular question-answering (Q&amp;A) websites. It accumulates millions of programming related questions and answers to support the developers in software development. Unfortunately, a large number of questions are not answered at all, which might hurt the quality or purpose of this community-oriented knowledge base. Up to 29\% of Stack Overflow questions do not have any answers. There have been existing attempts in detecting the unanswered questions. Unfortunately, they primarily rely on the question attributes (e.g., score, view count) that are not available during the submission of a question. Detection of the potentially unanswered questions in advance during question submission could help one improve the question and thus receive the answers in time. In this paper, we compare unanswered and answered questions quantitatively and qualitatively by analyzing a total of 4.8 million questions from Stack Overflow. We find that topics discussed in the question, the experience of the question submitter, and readability of question texts could often determine whether a question would be answered or not. Our qualitative study also reveals several other non-trivial factors that not only explain (partially) why the questions remain unanswered but also guide the novice users to improve their questions. We develop four machine learning models to predict the unanswered questions during their submission. According to the experiments, our models predict the unanswered questions with a maximum of about 79\% accuracy and significantly outperform the state-of-the-art prediction models.},

In this study, we investigate a similar behavior and its dynamics in the websites of StackExchange. We find that most of the users in these websites tend to contribute predominantly to one of the activities available on these websites. Such a behavior yields a high-level distribution of users across the activities, referred to as User-distribution. We find that this distribution varies for different websites of StackExchange. We also observe that the users contributing to different activities trigger each other to provide more contribution. Using these insights, we build a model that explains the effect of change in user-distribution on the amount of knowledge produced on these websites. The model shows that one can formulate an optimal ecosystem by motivating the right kind of users, which leads to the maximum fostering of knowledge on these websites.},

abstract = {Community Question Answering (CQA) portals provide rich sources of information on a variety of topics. However, the authenticity and quality of questions and answers (Q&amp;As) has proven hard to control. In a troubling direction, the widespread growth of crowdsourcing websites has created a large-scale, potentially difficult-to-detect workforce to manipulate malicious contents in CQA. The crowd workers who join the same crowdsourcing task about promotion campaigns in CQA collusively manipulate deceptive Q&amp;As for promoting a target (product or service). The collusive spamming group can fully control the sentiment of the target. How to utilize the structure and the attributes for detecting manipulated Q&amp;As? How to detect the collusive group and leverage the group information for the detection task?To shed light on these research questions, we propose a unified framework to tackle the challenge of detecting collusive spamming activities of CQA. First, we interpret the questions and answers in CQA as two independent networks. Second, we detect collusive question groups and answer groups from these two networks respectively by measuring the similarity of the contents posted within a short duration. Third, using attributes (individual-level and group-level) and correlations (user-based and content-based), we proposed a combined factor graph model to detect deceptive Q&amp;As simultaneously by combining two independent factor graphs. With a large-scale practical data set, we find that the proposed framework can detect deceptive contents at early stage, and outperforms a number of competitive baselines.},

abstract = {Context. The accumulation of technical debt (TD) items can lead to risks in software projects, such a gradual decrease in product quality, difficulties in their maintenance, and ultimately the cancellation of the project. To mitigate these risks, developers need means to identify TD items, which enable better documentation and improvements in TD management. Recent literature has proposed different indicator-based strategies for TD identification. However, there is limited empirical evidence to support that developers use these indicators to identify TD in practice. In this context, data from Q&amp;A websites, such as Stack Overflow (SO), have been extensively leveraged in recent studies to investigate software engineering practices from a developers' point of view. Goal. This paper seeks to investigate, from the point of view of practitioners, how developers commonly identify TD items in their projects. Method. We mined, curated, and selected a total of 140 TD-related discussions on SO, from which we performed both quantitative and qualitative analyses. Results. We found that SO's practitioners commonly discuss TD identification, revealing 29 different low-level indicators for recognizing TD items on code, infrastructure, architecture, and tests. We grouped low-level indicators based on their themes, producing an aggregated set of 13 distinct high-level indicators. We then classified all low- and high-level indicators into three different categories according to which type of debt each of them is meant to identify. Conclusions. We organize the empirical evidence on the low- and high-level indicators and their relationship to types of TD in a conceptual framework, which may assist developers and serve as guidance for future research, shedding new light on TD identification state-of-practice.},

However, there is still little known about these SV-specific discussions on different Q&amp;A sites. Objective: We present a large-scale empirical study to understand developers’ SV discussions and how these discussions are being supported by Q&amp;A sites. Method: We use topic modeling to uncover the topics of 71,329 curated SV posts from two large Q&amp;A sites, namely Stack Overflow (SO) and Security StackExchange (SSE). We then analyze the popularity, difficulty, and level of expertise for each topic. We also perform a qualitative analysis to identify the types of solutions to SV-related questions. Results: We identify 13 main SV discussion topics. Many topics do not follow the distributions and trends in expert-based security sources, e.g., Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) and Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP). We also discover that SV discussions attract more experts to answer than many other domains, but some difficult SV topics (e.g., Vulnerability Scanning Tools) still receive quite limited support from experts. Moreover, we identify seven key types of answers given to SV questions, in which SO often provides code and instructions, while SSE usually gives experience-based advice and explanations. Conclusion: Our findings provide support for researchers and practitioners to effectively acquire, share and leverage SV knowledge on Q&amp;A sites.},

abstract = {Nowadays, community-based question answering (CQA) services have accumulated millions of users to share valuable knowledge. An essential function in CQA tasks is the accurate matching of answers w.r.t given questions. Existing methods usually ignore the redundant, heterogeneous, and multi-modal properties of CQA systems. In this paper, we propose a multi-modal attentive interactive convolutional matching method (MMAICM) to model the multi-modal content and social context jointly for questions and answers in a unified framework for CQA retrieval, which explores the redundant, heterogeneous, and multi-modal properties of CQA systems jointly. A well-designed attention mechanism is proposed to focus on useful word-pair interactions and neglect meaningless and noisy word-pair interactions. Moreover, a multi-modal interaction matrix method and a novel meta-path based network representation approach are proposed to consider the multi-modal content and social context, respectively. The attentive interactive convolutional matching network is proposed to infer the relevance between questions and answers, which can capture both the lexical and the sequential information of the contents. Experiment results on two real-world datasets demonstrate the superior performance of MMAICM compared with other state-of-the-art algorithms.},

abstract = {Providing personalized online learning services has become a hot research topic. Online knowledge-sharing services represents a popular approach to enable learners to use fragmented spare time. User asks and answers questions in the platform, and the platform also recommends relevant questions to users based on their learning interested and context. However, in the big data era, information overload is a challenge, as both online learners and learning resources are embedded in data rich environment. Offering such web services requires an intelligent recommender system to automatically filter out irrelevant information, mine underling user preference, and distil latent information. Such a recommender system needs to be able to mine complex latent information, distinguish differences between users efficiently. In this study, we refine a recommender system of a prior work for web-based knowledge sharing. The system utilizes attention-based mechanisms and involves high-order feature interactions. Our experimental results show that the system outperforms known benchmarks and has great potential to be used for the web-based learning service.},

abstract = {We transfer a key idea from the field of sentiment analysis to a new domain: community question answering (cQA). The cQA task we are interested in is the following: given a question and a thread of comments, we want to re-rank the comments, so that the ones that are good answers to the question would be ranked higher than the bad ones. We notice that good vs. bad comments use specific vocabulary and that one can often predict the goodness/badness of a comment even ignoring the question, based on the comment contents only. This leads us to the idea to build a good/bad polarity lexicon as an analogy to the positive/negative sentiment polarity lexicons, commonly used in sentiment analysis. In particular, we use pointwise mutual information in order to build large-scale goodness polarity lexicons in a semi-supervised manner starting with a small number of initial seeds. The evaluation results show an improvement of 0.7 MAP points absolute over a very strong baseline, and state-of-the art performance on SemEval-2016 Task 3.},

abstract = {We aim at summarizing answers in community question-answering (CQA). While most previous work focuses on factoid question-answering, we focus on the non-factoid question-answering. Unlike factoid CQA, non-factoid question-answering usually requires passages as answers. The shortness, sparsity and diversity of answers form interesting challenges for summarization. To tackle these challenges, we propose a sparse coding-based summarization strategy that includes three core ingredients: short document expansion, sentence vectorization, and a sparse-coding optimization framework. Specifically, we extend each answer in a question-answering thread to a more comprehensive representation via entity linking and sentence ranking strategies. From answers extended in this manner, each sentence is represented as a feature vector trained from a short text convolutional neural network model. We then use these sentence representations to estimate the saliency of candidate sentences via a sparse-coding framework that jointly considers candidate sentences and Wikipedia sentences as reconstruction items. Given the saliency vectors for all candidate sentences, we extract sentences to generate an answer summary based on a maximal marginal relevance algorithm. Experimental results on a benchmark data collection confirm the effectiveness of our proposed method in answer summarization of non-factoid CQA, and moreover, its significant improvement compared to state-of-the-art baselines in terms of ROUGE metrics.},

abstract = {Information sharing dynamics of social networks rely on a small set of influencers to effectively reach a large audience. Our recent results and observations demonstrate that the shape and identity of this elite, especially those contributing original content, is difficult to predict. Information acquisition is often cited as an example of a public good. However, this emerging and powerful theory has yet to provably offer qualitative insights on how specialization of users into active and passive participants occurs.This paper bridges, for the first time, the theory of public goods and the analysis of diffusion in social media. We introduce a non-linear model of perishable public goods, leveraging new observations about sharing of media sources. The primary contribution of this work is to show that shelf time, which characterizes the rate at which content get renewed, is a critical factor in audience participation. Our model proves a fundamental dichotomy in information diffusion: While short-lived content has simple and predictable diffusion, long-lived content has complex specialization. This occurs even when all information seekers are ex ante identical and could be a contributing factor to the difficulty of predicting social network participation and evolution.},

Over the years, Stack Overflow has accumulated an impressive knowledge base of snippets of code that are amply documented. We are interested in studying how programmers use these snippets of code in their projects. Can we find Stack Overflow snippets in real projects? When snippets are used, is this copy literal or does it suffer adaptations? And are these adaptations specializations required by the idiosyncrasies of the target artifact, or are they motivated by specific requirements of the programmer? The large-scale study presented on this paper analyzes 909k non-fork Python projects hosted on Github, which contain 290M function definitions, and 1.9M Python snippets captured in Stack Overflow. Results are presented as quantitative analysis of block-level code cloning intra and inter Stack Overflow and GitHub, and as an analysis of programming behaviors through the qualitative analysis of our findings.},

Organizational culture, informal roles, and individual attitudes interact to influence organizational processes such as knowledge sharing, a process vital to organizational performance and innovation. To explore such organizational dynamics, we developed an agent-based model (ABM) that incorporates dynamic social networks over the physical environment of a hospital in southwest Virginia. The ABM simulates attitude formation and knowledge spread within the hospital. Social networks are dynamically created as agents interact while simple rules based on cascade and threshold models of diffusion drive the decision to share knowledge. Results show that there is a strong effect by formal roles in the hospital that are important in social network development and knowledge diffusion.},

abstract = {Context: Previous work have investigated the industry's state of practice on technical debt (TD) by surveying invited practitioners. However, these studies have included only practitioners with a sound understanding of TD, which might incur biases in their findings. One way to reduce this bias is to consider Q&amp;A platforms, such as Stack Overflow (SO), because of containing practitioners with different roles and levels of TD knowledge. Therefore, the discussions on SO can broaden the perception of the state of practice on TD in the industry. Goal: To investigate how TD concepts have been discussed by SO's practitioners. Method: First, we employed data mining techniques to identify TD-related discussions on SO. Next, based on significance and popularity metrics, we considered 195 discussions to be further investigated. For each discussion, we analyzed its contents to identify types of TD followed by activities, strategies, and tools used in its management. Results: We found that code, infrastructure, and architecture debt are the most discussed types of TD on SO. Similarly, TD identification and payment are the most discussed activities. Regarding tools and strategies for TD management, SonarQube and refactoring have been mostly mentioned by practitioners. Conclusion: Our findings may indicate new research directions, as well as expanding the empirical knowledge on how the industry has handled TD.},

abstract = {Context: Technical debt (TD) can compromise the quality of software systems in the long term. However, depending on the needs and properties of the specific product, different quality characteristics may be considered in the assessment with different levels of relevance. In this way, quality characteristics can guide teams in managing the TD, from identifying to paying for the TD items relevant to each situation. Although a set of TD item indicators has been identified in the literature, there is no clear guidance on how these indicators can be efficiently used to identify TD items. Aims: To investigate, from the point of view of software professionals using the SO platform, the relationship between the TD item indicators and the quality characteristics of the system, in order to guide the use of indicators for greater efficiency and effectiveness in identifying and managing DT items from a quality perspective. Method: We extracted empirical evidence using data mining from discussions related to TD on the SO. From the execution of an analysis process, the quality characteristics related to the occurrence of DT items identified in the discussions, the respective indicators and types of debt were identified. Results: The main results reveal that maintainability is the characteristic most related to TD through its sub-characteristics: modifiability, testability and modularity. Code debt items can be related to all quality characteristics, while Infrastructure debt can resonate up to 6 characteristics. All quality characteristics have at least one associated indicator, with an emphasis on Maintainability with 13 high-level and 28 low-level indicators. The indicator related to version problems is the one with the highest number of quality features. Conclusion: The relationship between indicators, TD types and quality characteristics was organized in a conceptual diagram in order to assist software teams in identifying which TD items are related to the quality characteristics that are critical to the project context, contributing to decision making regarding the best strategy for debt management.},

abstract = {As a popular Q&amp;A site for programming, Stack Overflow is a treasure for developers. However, the amount of questions and answers on Stack Overflow make it difficult for developers to efficiently locate the information they are looking for. There are two gaps leading to poor search results: the gap between the user's intention and the textual query, and the semantic gap between the query and the post content. Therefore, developers have to constantly reformulate their queries by correcting misspelled words, adding limitations to certain programming languages or platforms, etc. As query reformulation is tedious for developers, especially for novices, we propose an automated software-specific query reformulation approach based on deep learning. With query logs provided by Stack Overflow, we construct a large-scale query reformulation corpus, including the original queries and corresponding reformulated ones. Our approach trains a Transformer model that can automatically generate candidate reformulated queries when given the user's original query. The evaluation results show that our approach outperforms five state-of-the-art baselines, and achieves a 5.6\% to 33.5\% boost in terms of ExactMatch and a 4.8\% to 14.4\% boost in terms of GLEU.},

Eleven developers were tasked with determining if the SO question sentiment was positive, negative or neutral. The results from the questionnaire indicate that developers mostly rated the sentiment of SO questions as neutral, stating that they received little or no emotional feedback from the questions. Tools that were designed to analyze Software Engineering related texts (SentiStrength-SE, SentiCR, and Senti4SD) were on average more closely aligned with developer ratings for a majority of the questions than general purpose tools for detecting SO question sentiment. We discuss cases where tools and developer sentiment differ along with implications of the results. Overall, the sentiment tool output on the question title and body is more aligned with the developer rating than just the title alone. Since SO is a very common medium of technical exchange, we also report that adding code snippets, short titles, and multiple tags were top three features developers prefer in SO questions in order for it to be answered quickly.},

abstract = {Stack Overflow is one of the most popular technical Q&amp;A sites used by software developers. Seeking help from Stack Overflow has become an essential part of software developers’ daily work for solving programming-related questions. Although the Stack Overflow community has provided quality assurance guidelines to help users write better questions, we observed that a significant number of questions submitted to Stack Overflow are of low quality. In this paper, we introduce a new web-based tool, Code2Que, which can help developers in writing higher quality questions for a given code snippet. Code2Que consists of two main stages: offline learning and online recommendation. In the offline learning phase, we first collect a set of good quality ⟨code snippet, question⟩ pairs as training samples. We then train our model on these training samples via a deep sequence-to-sequence approach, enhanced with an attention mechanism, a copy mechanism and a coverage mechanism. In the online recommendation phase, for a given code snippet, we use the offline trained model to generate question titles to assist less experienced developers in writing questions more effectively. To evaluate Code2Que, we first sampled 50 low quality ⟨code snippet, question⟩ pairs from the Python and Java datasets on Stack Overflow. Then we conducted a user study to evaluate the question titles generated by our approach as compared to human-written ones using three metrics: Clearness, Fitness and Willingness to Respond. Our experimental results show that for a large number of low-quality questions in Stack Overflow, Code2Que can improve the question titles in terms of Clearness, Fitness and Willingness measures.},

abstract = {This full research paper focuses on the design of a Teaching Practices Management System (TPMS) which supports the sharing of teaching practices (TPs) amongst computer science instructors. Many years of valuable TPs can be lost due to academic retirement when no competent knowledge management system is available for recording these TPs. Consequently, novice teachers are currently facing critical challenges when delivering subject knowledge that relates to algorithms, programming and the development of computational thinking skills without the benefit of others’ experience. After a study of the relevant literature, it could be seen that far too little attention has been paid to the capturing and sharing of TPs which are not easily expressed or communicated in visual or verbal terms. Thus, we design and then demonstrate a Teaching Practices Management System (TPMS) which supports the capturing of TPs. A quantitative and a qualitative evaluation of users’ experiences of employing the system shows that instructors are satisfied with it and are mostly positive about its features. The findings of this study hold considerable promise in relation to developing engaging and effective knowledge sharing systems for use by academic instructors.},

abstract = {Software reuse is an important and crucial quality attribute in modern software engineering, where almost all software projects, open source or commercial, no matter small or ultra-large, source code reuse in one way or another. Although software reuse has experienced an increased adoption throughout the years with the exponentially growing number of available third-party libraries, frameworks and APIs, little knowledge exists to investigate what aspects of code reuse developers discuss. In this study, we look into bridging this gap by examining Stack Overflow to understand the challenges developers encounter when trying to reuse code. Using the Stack Overflow tags “code-reuse” and “reusability”, we extracted and analyzed 1,409 posts, composed of questions and answers. Our findings indicate that despite being popular, reuse questions take relatively longer than typical other questions to receive an accepted answer. From these posts, we identified 9 categories that group the different ways developers discuss software reuse. We found Java and ASP.NET MVC to be the most discussed programming language and framework, respectively. Based on the programming languages and frameworks mentioned in the posts, we noted that Web software development is the most frequently targeted environment. This study can be utilized to further analyze aspects about software reuse and develop guidelines to be practiced in industry and taught when forming new developers.},

In this study, we empirically explore the knowledge management activities that large and small and medium sized companies in Finland have. The focus is especially on sharing and securing knowledge. The theoretical background for the paper is in the broader frame of knowledge management literature, and especially the knowledge sharing and knowledge security viewpoints. The empirical study offers a view on the status of both knowledge sharing and knowledge security in companies of different sizes. The study is able to identify the main challenges in knowledge sharing among companies of different sizes. Furthermore, the areas of knowledge security that still need more careful attention and development actions among companies in their daily operations, are also identified.},

However, the process of searching for code snippets and integrating them within existing source code can be tedious. In order to improve efficiency and reduce time spent on code reuse, we present an automated code reuse tool for the Eclipse IDE (Integrated Developer Environment), NLP2TestableCode. NLP2TestableCode can not only search for Java code snippets using natural language tasks, but also evaluate code snippets based on a user's existing code, modify snippets to improve fit and correct errors, before presenting the user with the best snippet, all without leaving the editor. NLP2TestableCode also includes functionality to automatically generate customisable test cases and suggest argument and return types, in order to further evaluate code snippets. In evaluation, NLP2TestableCode was capable of finding compilable code snippets for 82.9\% of tasks, and testable code snippets for 42.9\%.},

abstract = {Q&amp;A communities are playing an important role in online knowledge sharing, where a large number of users with various knowledge background make tremendous contributions to solving many technical problems based on crowd intelligence. However, as new questions are increasingly posted, it is a non-trivial issue to find a matching answerer for each question. As a result, many questions fail to receive satisfying answers in time. This paper addresses the problem by predicting the best answerer for the new question. Many existing efforts are devoted to predicting the best answerer mainly by calculating the textual similarity between questions and a user’s historical post documents. Some works consider other features, such as the similarity of tags between questions and users, the average quality of a user’s historical answers, and so on. But few works consider interaction within the community. In recent years, works that take account of the interaction between community items (such as GCN and GAT) have made considerable progress in graph mining tasks like item recommendation, node representation, node classification, and link prediction. This kind of graph mining method can easily leverage interactive information in the community and encode it in an easy-to-use way which is very helpful for downstream tasks such as recommendation. However, questions that need to be recommended to answerers are new coming ones and with no interaction with any other node in the community yet. How to make reasonable use of collaborative information to improve recommendation performance is a real challenge. In this paper, we use the interactive information between candidate answerers and combine text information to make our best answerer recommendation. There are two main parts, LDA(Latent Dirichlet Allocation) topic model is used to capture the text information and graph attention networks (GATs) for interaction. We evaluated our approach on a real dataset from Stack Exchange. The result shows that our approach outperforms all the baseline methods.},

abstract = {In recent years, Community Question Answering (CQA) has emerged as a popular platform for knowledge curation and archival. An interesting aspect of question answering is that it combines aspects from natural language processing, information retrieval, and machine learning. In this paper, we have explored how the depth of the neural network influences the accuracy of prediction of deleted questions in question-answering forums. We have used different shallow and deep models for prediction and analyzed the relationships between number of hidden layers, accuracy, and computational time. The results suggest that while deep networks perform better than shallow networks in modeling complex non-linear functions, increasing the depth may not always produce desired results. We observe that the performance of the deep neural network suffers significantly due to vanishing gradients when large number of hidden layers are present. Constantly increasing the depth of the model increases accuracy initially, after which the accuracy plateaus, and finally drops. Adding each layer is also expensive in terms of the time required to train the model. This research is situated in the domain of neural information retrieval and contributes towards building a theory on how deep neural networks can be efficiently and accurately used for predicting question deletion. We predict deleted questions with more than 90\% accuracy using two to ten hidden layers, with less accurate results for shallower and deeper architectures.},

abstract = {Informal documentation contained in resources such as Q&amp;A websites (e.g., Stack Overflow) is a precious resource for developers, who can find there examples on how to use certain APIs, as well as opinions about pros and cons of such APIs. Automatically identifying and classifying such opinions can alleviate developers' burden in performing manual searches, and can be used to recommend APIs that are good from some points of view (e.g., performance), or highlight those less ideal from other perspectives (e.g., compatibility). We propose POME (Pattern-based Opinion MinEr), an approach that leverages natural language parsing and pattern-matching to classify Stack Overflow sentences referring to APIs according to seven aspects (e.g., performance, usability), and to determine their polarity (positive vs negative). The patterns have been inferred by manually analyzing 4,346 sentences from Stack Overflow linked to a total of 30 APIs. We evaluated POME by (i) comparing the pattern-matching approach with machine learners leveraging the patterns themselves as well as n-grams extracted from Stack Overflow posts; (ii) assessing the ability of POME to detect the polarity of sentences, as compared to sentiment-analysis tools; (iii) comparing POME with the state-of-the-art Stack Overflow opinion mining approach, Opiner, through a study involving 24 human evaluators. Our study shows that POME exhibits a higher precision than a state-of-the-art technique (Opiner), in terms of both opinion aspect identification and polarity assessment.},

abstract = {Using online Q&amp;A forums, such as Stack Overflow (SO), for guidance to resolve program bugs, among other development issues, is commonplace in modern software development practice. Runtime exceptions (RE) is one such important class of bugs that is actively discussed on SO. In this work we present a technique and prototype tool called MAESTRO that can automatically recommend an SO post that is most relevant to a given Java RE in a developer's code. MAESTRO compares the exception-generating program scenario in the developer's code with that discussed in an SO post and returns the post with the closest match. To extract and compare the exception scenario effectively, MAESTRO first uses the answer code snippets in a post to implicate a subset of lines in the post's question code snippet as responsible for the exception and then compares these lines with the developer's code in terms of their respective Abstract Program Graph (APG) representations. The APG is a simplified and abstracted derivative of an abstract syntax tree, proposed in this work, that allows an effective comparison of the functionality embodied in the high-level program structure, while discarding many of the low-level syntactic or semantic differences. We evaluate MAESTRO on a benchmark of 78 instances of Java REs extracted from the top 500 Java projects on GitHub and show that MAESTRO can return either a highly relevant or somewhat relevant SO post corresponding to the exception instance in 71\% of the cases, compared to relevant posts returned in only 8\% - 44\% instances, by four competitor tools based on state-of-the-art techniques. We also conduct a user experience study of MAESTRO with 10 Java developers, where the participants judge MAESTRO reporting a highly relevant or somewhat relevant post in 80\% of the instances. In some cases the post is judged to be even better than the one manually found by the participant.},

Each organization is trying to come up with ways of sharing knowledge to create impact in the society they thrive in. This paper is based on exploratory survey to assess the knowledge sharing techniques amongst the jua kali artisans in Kenya. This study sought to analyze knowledge sharing amongst Jua Kali workers in Kenya; Describe the nature of their business; investigate the type of knowledge they posses; identify the knowledge sharing mechanism they use; analyze how effective the knowledge sharing mechanisms have been; identify the challenges affecting the effective sharing of knowledge; and propose strategies which can be used by the Jua Kali workers in Kenya to enhance effective knowledge sharing.Primary data was collected through interviews using self-administered questionnaires which were distributed to the Jua kali artisans. Additional information on Jua kali workers was collected from relevant scholarly documents analysis. The findingsindicate that most of the Jua Kali workers use mentoring as a way of sharing knowledge. These knowledge sharing techniques are hampered by language barrier this is because some of the mentors or trainees are largely illiterate and can only communicate in their vernaculars. The findings can be use by the Kenyan government to develop a training of trainers programme for the experienced artisans to equip them with new skills as well as how to impart them.},

abstract = {With Community Question Answering (CQA) evolving into a quite popular method for information seeking and providing, it also becomes a target for spammers to disseminate promotion campaigns. Although there are a number of quality estimation efforts on the CQA platform, most of these works focus on identifying and reducing low-quality answers, which are mostly generated by impatient or inexperienced answerers. However, a large number of promotion answers appear to provide high-quality information to cheat CQA users in future interactions. Therefore, most existing quality estimation works in CQA may fail to detect these specially designed answers or question-answer pairs. In contrast to these works, we focus on the promotion channels of spammers, which include (shortened) URLs, telephone numbers and social media accounts. Spammers rely on these channels to connect to users to achieve promotion goals so they are irreplaceable for spamming activities. We propose a propagation algorithm to diffuse promotion intents on an "answerer-channel" bipartite graph and detect possible spamming activities. A supervised learning framework is also proposed to identify whether a QA pair is spam based on propagated promotion intents. Experimental results based on more than 6 million entries from a popular Chinese CQA portal show that our approach outperforms a number of existing quality estimation methods for detecting promotion campaigns on both the answer level and QA pair level.},

abstract = {Community Question Answering (CQA) sites facilitate users to ask questions and get answered by fellow users interested in the topic of the question. A vast number of questions are posted on these sites every day. Some questions receive numbers of good quality answers whereas some questions fail to attract even a single answer from the community users. Also, some questions receive very late answers. The problem behind the unanswered question or late answers was that the question was not seen or not routed to the expert user or interested users. There are no identified experts of given topic on these sites. Hence, finding users who will be interested in answering a question of the specific topic and sending the question to that user is a challenging task. We have developed a system to identify the group of users who can potentially be the answerer of a given question. The group of users is identified using their past question and answers. We rank the users of the identified group considering their answering behaviour, time of posting their answers etc. The proposed methodology has several advantages such as routing questions to recently active users and at the time of their convenience. Experimental analysis shows that to get at least one answer, the question must be routed to at least eight answerers.},

In this paper, we study the duplication of code snippets between two popular sources of software development information: the Stack Overflow Q&amp;A site and software development tutorials. Our goals are to empirically understand the scale of repeated information between these two sources, to gain insight into why developers copy information from one source to the other, and to understand the evolution of duplicated information over time. To this end, we correlate a set of nearly 600 tutorials on Android available on the Web to the SOTorrent dataset, which isolates code snippets from Stack Overflow posts and tracks their changes over time. Our findings reveal that there are over 1,400 duplicate code snippets related to Android on Stack Overflow. Code that was duplicated on the two sources is effective at answering Stack Overflow questions; a significant number (31\%) of answers that contained a duplicate code block were chosen as the accepted answer. Qualitative analysis reveals that developers commonly use Stack Overflow to ask clarifying questions about code they reused from tutorials, and copy code snippets from tutorials to provide answers to questions.},

Users of these sites can select a tag from the existing tag list or contribute a new tag to their questions. The process of tagging is manual, which results in inconsistent and sometimes even incorrect or incomplete tagging. To overcome this issue, we design an automatic tag suggestion technique which can suggest tags to the users based on their question text. It serves to minimize the error of the manual tagging system by providing more relevant tags to questions. The performance of the proposed system is evaluated using Precision, Recall, and F1-score.},

In this work, we wanted to deepen our understanding of the localness of knowledge sharing through investigating the topical and typological patterns related to the geographic characteristics, geographic locality of user activities, and motivations of local knowledge sharing. To this end, we analyzed a 12-month period Q&amp;A dataset from Naver KiN "Here" and a supplementary survey dataset from 285 mobile users. Our results revealed several unique characteristics of location-based social Q&amp;A. When compared with conventional social Q&amp;A sites, Naver KiN "Here" had very different topical/typological patterns. Naver KiN "Here" exhibited a strong spatial locality where the answerers mostly had 1-3 spatial clusters of contributions, the topical distributions varied widely across different districts, and a typical cluster spanned a few neighboring districts. In addition, we uncovered unique motivators, e.g. ownership of local knowledge and sense of local community. The findings reported in the paper have significant implications for the design of Q&amp;A systems, especially location-based social Q&amp;A systems.},

In many organizations, knowledge management is often inadequate when it comes to web-based knowledge sharing, particularly among academics who work in Saudi universities. To ensure that a knowledge sharing system can be well implemented when communicating internally in an academic context, there is a need to know why academics accept or reject the use of web-based knowledge sharing systems. Therefore, the aim of this research is to determine the factors that affect academics' behaviours toward using web technology to share knowledge in Saudi universities. A web-based knowledge sharing adoption model is constructed based on the factors which already exist in technology acceptance theories, such as the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology and task-technology fit, as well as other factors which are explored in knowledge sharing literature reviews to enrich the proposed model.},

In this paper, we formalize the answer selection problem from the user expertise view, considering both the semantic relevance in question-answer pair and user expertise in question-user pair. We design a novel matching function, explicitly modeling the influence of user expertise in community acceptance. Moreover, we introduce latent user vectors into the representation learning of answer, capturing the implicit topic interests in learned user vectors. Extensive experiments on two datasets from real world CQA sites demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art approaches for answer selection in CQA. Furthermore, the user representations learned by our model provide us a quantitative way to understand both the authority and topic-sensitive interests of users.},

abstract = {Software Q&amp;A sites (like Stack Overflow) play an essential role in developers’ day-to-day work for problem-solving. Although search engines (like Google) are widely used to obtain a list of relevant posts for technical problems, we observed that the redundant relevant posts and sheer amount of information barriers developers to digest and identify the useful answers. In this paper, we propose a tool AnswerBot which enables to automatically generate an answer summary for a technical problem. AnswerBot consists of three main stages, (1) relevant question retrieval, (2) useful answer paragraph selection, (3) diverse answer summary generation. We implement it in the form of a search engine website. To evaluate AnswerBot, we first build a repository includes a large number of Java questions and their corresponding answers from Stack Overflow. Then, we conduct a user study that evaluates the answer summary generated by AnswerBot and two baselines (based on Google and Stack Overflow search engine) for 100 queries. The results show that the answer summaries generated by AnswerBot are more relevant, useful, and diverse. Moreover, we also substantially improved the efficiency of AnswerBot (from 309 to 8 seconds per query).},

This raises the question of how to encourage employees to share informal knowledge in order to successfully embrace organisational change in increasingly digitised environments with a view to retaining them long-term. Through the development of a three-part empirical study, this research paper investigates the role played by informal knowledge sharing networks and social media in expediting digital transformation within a public sector organisation. Our findings show that the public sector stands to benefit from informal knowledge sharing, and that both a permissive organisational culture and the provision of clearly demarcated ‘knowledge sharing spaces’ are fundamental in this respect.},

abstract = {Community question answering(CQA) websites such as Yahoo! Answers and Stack Overflow provide a new way of asking and answering questions which are not well served by general web search engines. Due to the huge volume and ever-increasing number of questions, not all new questions can get fully answered in required time. Therefore, it is of great significance to design some effective strategies of recommending experts for new questions. In this paper, we propose a novel personalized recommendation method for routing new questions to a group of experts. Different from prior work which only considers the topic modeling or the link structure, we aim at recommending new questions to more appropriate experts by considering both of these two factors. Moreover, we design a new strategy of network construction with the personalization fully considered. The comparison experiments are conducted with Stack Overflow data and the experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method improves the recommendation performance over other methods in expert recommendation.},

abstract = {Community-based Question Answering (CQA) services allow users to find and share information by interacting with others. A key to the success of CQA services is the quality and timeliness of the responses that users get. With the increasing use of mobile devices, searchers increasingly expect to find more local and time-sensitive information, such as the current special at a cafe around the corner. Yet, few services provide such hyper-local and time-aware question answering. This requires intelligent content recommendation and careful use of notifications (e.g., recommending questions to only selected users). To explore these issues, we developed RealQA, a real-time CQA system with a mobile interface, and performed two user studies: a formative pilot study with the initial system design, and a more extensive study with the revised UI and algorithms. The research design combined qualitative survey analysis and quantitative behavior analysis under different conditions. We report our findings of the prevalent information needs and types of responses users provided, and of the effectiveness of the recommendation and notification strategies on user experience and satisfaction. Our system and findings offer insights and implications for designing real-time CQA systems, and provide a valuable platform for future research.},

We conducted a Systematic Mapping study involving 266 papers from six relevant databases to address this gap. In this preliminary work we explored the level of academic interest Stack Overflow has generated, the publication venues, the topics studied and approaches used. Outcomes show that Stack Overflow has attracted increasing research interest, with topics relating to both community dynamics and human factors, and technical issues. In addition, research studies have been largely evaluative or proposed solutions, though this latter approach tends to lack validation. This signals the need for future work to explore the nature of Stack Overflow research contributions that are provided, and their quality. We outline our research agenda for continuing with such efforts.},

Even, in the process of knowledge management, knowledge sharing issue attracts more attention of scholars and researchers in the field. It has been emphasized that effective knowledge sharing can even determine the success of projects in organizations. In reality, there are reports on the high failure rate in information systems development projects in organization. In order to address the above mentioned issue, this study with a comprehensive literature review, proposed a conceptual model of the factors affecting knowledge sharing in of information systems development projects. This model suggests that personality factors and leadership qualities have essential role in knowledge sharing among project team members. This model help project managers to identify important factors affecting knowledge sharing, create suitable behavior among their employees and enhance their project success rate.},

To make sense of this textual data, topic modelling is frequently used as a text-mining tool for the discovery of hidden semantic structures in text bodies. Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) is a commonly used topic model that aims to explain the structure of a corpus by grouping texts. LDA requires multiple parameters to work well, and there are only rough and sometimes conflicting guidelines available on how these parameters should be set. In this paper, we contribute (i) a broad study of parameters to arrive at good local optima for GitHub and Stack Overflow text corpora, (ii) an a-posteriori characterisation of text corpora related to eight programming languages, and (iii) an analysis of corpus feature importance via per-corpus LDA configuration. We find that (1) popular rules of thumb for topic modelling parameter configuration are not applicable to the corpora used in our experiments, (2) corpora sampled from GitHub and Stack Overflow have different characteristics and require different configurations to achieve good model fit, and (3) we can predict good configurations for unseen corpora reliably. These findings support researchers and practitioners in efficiently determining suitable configurations for topic modelling when analysing textual data contained in software repositories.},

Hence, they frequently submit their questions with sample code segments and issue descriptions. Unfortunately, it is not always possible to reproduce their reported issues from such code segments. This phenomenon might prevent their questions from getting prompt and appropriate solutions. In this paper, we report an exploratory study on the reproducibility of the issues discussed in 400 questions of Stack Overflow. In particular, we parse, compile, execute and even carefully examine the code segments from these questions, spent a total of 200 man hours, and then attempt to reproduce their programming issues. The outcomes of our study are two-fold. First, we find that 68\% of the code segments require minor and major modifications in order to reproduce the issues reported by the developers. On the contrary, 22\% code segments completely fail to reproduce the issues. We also carefully investigate why these issues could not be reproduced and then provide evidence-based guidelines for writing effective code examples for Stack Overflow questions. Second, we investigate the correlation between issue reproducibility status (of questions) and corresponding answer meta-data such as the presence of an accepted answer. According to our analysis, a question with reproducible issues has at least three times higher chance of receiving an accepted answer than the question with irreproducible issues.},

abstract = {Developers frequently copy code snippets from publicly-available resources such as Stack Overflow (SO). While this may lead to a 'quick fix' for a development problem, little is known about how these copied code snippets affect the code quality of the recipient application, or how the quality of the recipient classes subsequently evolves over the time of the project. This has an impact on whether such code copying should be encouraged, and how classes that receive such code snippets should be monitored during evolution. To investigate this issue, we used instances from the SOTorrent database where Java snippets had been copied from Stack Overflow into GitHub projects. In each case, we measured the quality of the recipient class just prior to the addition of the snippet, immediately after the addition of the snippet, and at a later stage in the project. Our goal was to determine if the addition of the snippet caused quality to improve or deteriorate, and what the long-term implications were for the quality of the recipient class. Code quality was measured using the cohesion metrics Low-level Similarity-based Class Cohesion (LSCC) and Class Cohesion (CC). Over a random sample of 378 classes that received code snippets copied from Stack Overflow to GitHub, we found that in almost 70\% of the cases where the copied snippet affected cohesion, the effect was to reduce the cohesion of the recipient class. Furthermore, this deterioration in cohesion tends to persist in the subsequent evolution of recipient class. In over 70\% of cases the recipient class never fully regained the cohesion it lost in receiving the snippet. These results suggest that when copying code snippets from external repositories, more attention should be paid to integrating the code with the recipient class.},

Our findings indicate that continuous process improvement will be influenced by the project type.

Since users can be affiliated with groups belonging to different social networks, they can be supported by personal software agents able to perform activities aimed at supporting relationships and mutual cooperation among heterogeneous OSNs thematic groups. Basically software agents can encode users profiles with detailed information to be related with specific groups. This work discusses a multi-agent framework whose structure focuses on the role of software agents and the use of a common, shared dictionary for each group. Personal software agents are associated to OSN users to share knowledge for a specific theme for a number of groups related to that topic. Group agents are defined to support each group on each OSN by interacting with personal agents to manage group affiliation and enrich the common dictionaries of their own groups. The common dictionary of the group is a key element to provide knowledge sharing and interoperability between personal and group agents. In the proposed approach each user agent is able to personalize its own dictionary and enrich that of its own groups by means of selected categories.},

A total of 352 valid samples are collected in mainland China while adopting structural equation model (SEM) approach. The empirical results indicate that both aspects of health knowledge sharing, namely health knowledge seeking and health knowledge contribution, have significantly positive influences on patient perceived value in OHCs. Moreover, the effect of health knowledge seeking on patient perceived value is stronger than the effect of health knowledge contribution. Besides this, the moderating effects of patient social capital on the relationship between health knowledge sharing and patient perceived value are significant. Specifically, patient social capital strengthens the relationship between health knowledge contribution and patient perceived value, while it weakens the relationship between health knowledge seeking and patient perceived value in OHCs.},

This study aims to investigate factors influencing knowledge sharing and community promotion in the OHC in the perspectives of social support, commitment-trust, and trust transfer theory. A questionnaire survey is employed as a collection data technique. The study results reveal that informational support influences trust transfer, trust towards community and members of the community. In addition, emotional support has a positive impact on community commitment and trust in community members but not in the community itself. Further, community commitment is positively related to both knowledge sharing and community promotion. While trust towards the community is only positively related to community promotion, trust towards members of the community does not have a positive influence on both knowledge sharing and community promotion. This study contributes to the understanding of the relationships among social support, community commitment, and trust transfer towards knowledge sharing and community promotion in the OHC.

abstract = {In order to solve the issues of mismatches between the intentions of questioners and respondents of Question and Answer (Q&amp;A) sites, nine factors of impressions for Q&amp;A statements have been obtained through impressive experiments. Factor scores have been then estimated through multiple regression analysis by using the feature values of statements, e.g. syntactic information, etc. The factor scores obtained have been subsequently used for inspecting the possibility of detecting respondents who are expected to post appropriate answer to a newly posted question. However, the method so far has been largely dependent on the syntactic information extracted through morphological analysis. In addition, the number of explanatory variables used for estimating factor scores has been considerably numerous and complicated. Therefore, in this paper, factor scores are estimated using the feature values of syntactic information are extracted through 2-gram, instead of morphological analysis. The feature values based on 2-gram and those other than the syntactic information are set as explanatory variable. As a result of another multiple regression analysis, estimation accuracy with 2-gram shows almost equal to or better than that with morphological analysis for all the nine factors. Moreover, monadic term is sufficient in estimating factor scores, leading to much smaller samples of explanatory variables.},

abstract = {The sheer number of available technologies and the complex relationships among them make it challenging to choose the right technologies for software projects. Developers often turn to online resources (e.g., expert articles and community answers) to get a good understanding of the technology landscape. Such online resources are primarily opinion-based and are often out of date. Furthermore, information is often scattered in many online resources, which has to be aggregated to have a big picture of the technology landscape. In this paper, we exploit the fact that Stack Overflow users tag their questions with the main technologies that the questions revolve around, and develop association rule mining and community detection techniques to mine technology landscape from Stack Overflow question tags. The mined technology landscape is represented in a graphical Technology Associative Network (TAN). Our empirical study shows that the mined TAN captures a wide range of technologies, the complex relationships among the technologies, and the trend of the technologies in the developers' discussions on Stack Overflow. We develop a website (https://graphofknowledge.appspot.com/) for the community to access and evaluate the mined technology landscape. The website visit statistics by Google Analytics shows the developers' general interests in our technology landscape service. We also report a small-scale user study to evaluate the potential usefulness of our tool.},

abstract = {Answer selection plays a key role in community question answering (CQA). Previous research on answer selection usually ignores the problems of redundancy and noise prevalent in CQA. In this paper, we propose to treat different text segments differently and design a novel attentive interactive neural network (AI-NN) to focus on those text segments useful to answer selection. The representations of question and answer are first learned by convolutional neural networks (CNNs) or other neural network architectures. Then AI-NN learns interactions of each paired segments of two texts. Row-wise and column-wise pooling are used afterwards to collect the interactions. We adopt attention mechanism to measure the importance of each segment and combine the interactions to obtain fixed-length representations for question and answer. Experimental results on CQA dataset in SemEval-2016 demonstrate that AI-NN outperforms state-of-the-art method.},

abstract = {Context: Recently, more and more developer communities are abandoning their legacy support forums, moving onto Stack Overflow. The motivations are diverse, yet they typically include achieving faster response time and larger visibility through the access to a modern and very successful infrastructure. One downside of migration, however, is that the history and the crowdsourced knowledge hosted at previous sites remain separated or even get lost if a community decides to abandon completely the legacy developer forum.Goal: Adding to the body of evidence of existing research on best-answer prediction, here we show that, from a technical perspective, the content from existing developer forums might be automatically migrated to the Stack Overflow, although most of forums do not allow to mark a question as resolved, a distinctive feature of modern Q&amp;A sites.Method: We trained a binary classifier with data from Stack Overflow and then tested it with data scraped from Docusign, a developer forum that has recently completed the move.Results: Our findings show that best answers can be predicted with a good accuracy, only relying on shallow linguistic (text) features, such as answer length and the number of sentences, combined with other features like answer upvotes and age, which can be easily computed in near real-time.Conclusions: Results provide an initial yet positive evidence towards the automatic migration of crowdsourced knowledge from legacy forums to modern Q&amp;A sites.},

abstract = {Stack Overflow is the most popular discussion platform for software developers. However, recent research identified a large amount of insecure encryption code in production systems that has been inspired by examples given on Stack Overflow. By copying and pasting functional code, developers introduced exploitable software vulnerabilities into security-sensitive high-profile applications installed by millions of users every day.Proposed mitigations of this problem suffer from usability flaws and push developers to continue shopping for code examples on Stack Overflow once again. This motivates us to fight the proliferation of insecure code directly at the root before it even reaches the clipboard. By viewing Stack Overflow as a market, implementation of cryptography becomes a decision-making problem. In this context, our goal is to simplify the selection of helpful and secure examples. More specifically, we focus on supporting software developers in making better decisions on Stack Overflow by applying nudges, a concept borrowed from behavioral economics and psychology. This approach is motivated by one of our key findings: For 99.37\% of insecure code examples on Stack Overflow, similar alternatives are available that serve the same use case and provide strong cryptography.Our system design that modifies Stack Overflow is based on several nudges that are controlled by a deep neural network. It learns a representation for cryptographic API usage patterns and classification of their security, achieving average AUC-ROC of 0.992. With a user study, we demonstrate that nudge-based security advice significantly helps tackling the most popular and error-prone cryptographic use cases in Android.},

Stack Overflow treats source code snippets as plain text and searches surface snippets as they would any other text. Unfortunately, plain text does not capture the structural qualities of these snippets; for example, snippets frequently refer to specific API (e.g., Android), but by treating the snippets as text, linkage to the Android API is not always apparent. We perform snippet analysis to extract structural information from short plain-text snippets that are often found in Stack Overflow. This analysis is able to identify 253,137 method calls and type references from 21,250 Stack Overflow code snippets. We show how identifying these structural relationships from snippets could perform better than lexical search over code blocks in practice.},

With the increasing size and complexity of software, adequate software testing has become increasingly important. Developers often ask problems they face during testing on Community Question Answering (CQA) websites such as Stack Overflow. These websites can serve as good repositories to understand the common topics of discussions and challenges faced by developers during testing.  In this paper, we present a study of common challenges and important topics of discussion, by mining testing related questions asked on Stack Overflow. We use unsupervised learning to categorize the questions and rank all the Stack Overflow questions based on their importance. Our results show that topics such as test framework, database and client server are more often discussed compared to other topics. Also, there has been an uptrend for mobile development questions in testing related discussions.},

Upon applying our methodology, we provide frequent edit patterns and indicate how they could be used to answer future research questions.

abstract = {Developers often look for solutions to programming problems in community Q&amp;A sites like Stack Overflow. Due to the crowdsourcing nature of these Q&amp;A sites, many user-provided answers are wrong, less optimal or out-of-date. Relying on community-curated quality indicators (e.g., accepted answer, answer vote) cannot reliably identify these answer problems. Such problematic answers are often criticized by other users. However, these critiques are not readily discoverable when reading the posts. In this paper, we consider the answers being criticized and their critique posts as controversial discussions in community Q&amp;A sites. To help developers notice such controversial discussions and make more informed choices of appropriate solutions, we design an automatic open information extraction approach for systematically discovering and summarizing the controversies in Stack Overflow and exploiting official API documentation to assist the understanding of the discovered controversies. We apply our approach to millions of java/android-tagged Stack overflow questions and answers and discover a large scale of controversial discussions in Stack Overflow. Our manual evaluation confirms that the extracted controversy information is of high accuracy. A user study with 18 developers demonstrates the usefulness of our generated controversy summaries in helping developers avoid the controversial answers and choose more appropriate solutions to programming questions.},

abstract = {Community Question-Answering (CQA), where questions and answers are generated by peers, has become a popular method of information seeking in online environments. While the content repositories created through CQA sites have been used widely to support general purpose tasks, using them as online digital libraries that support educational needs is an emerging practice. Horizontal CQA services, such as Yahoo! Answers, and vertical CQA services, such as Brainly, are aiming to help students improve their learning process by answering their educational questions. In these services, receiving high quality answer(s) to a question is a critical factor not only for user satisfaction, but also for supporting learning. However, the questions are not necessarily answered by experts, and the askers may not have enough knowledge and skill to evaluate the quality of the answers they receive. This could be problematic when students build their own knowledge base by applying inaccurate information or knowledge acquired from online sources. Using moderators could alleviate this problem. However, a moderator's evaluation of answer quality may be inconsistent because it is based on their subjective assessments. Employing human assessors may also be insufficient due to the large amount of content available on a CQA site. To address these issues, we propose a framework for automatically assessing the quality of answers. This is achieved by integrating different groups of features - personal, community-based, textual, and contextual - to build a classification model and determine what constitutes answer quality. To test this evaluation framework, we collected more than 10 million educational answers posted by more than 3 million users on Brainly's United States and Poland sites. The experiments conducted on these datasets show that the model using Random Forest (RF) achieves more than 83\% accuracy in identifying high quality of answers. In addition, the findings indicate that personal and community-based features have more prediction power in assessing answer quality. Our approach also achieves high values on other key metrics such as F1-score and Area under ROC curve. The work reported here can be useful in many other contexts where providing automatic quality assessment in a digital repository of textual information is paramount.},

abstract = {Online knowledge sharing is an important factor in ensuring students continues learning outside the classroom. The advancement of technology now allows the students’ sharing of knowledge to take place regardless of time and place in an online learning environment using an online discussion interface. Efforts have been taken by many higher education institutions to encourage students to share their knowledge in online discussion interface, but however it fails to sustain the knowledge sharing activities. This poses the question of how to promote the knowledge sharing activities among students. While previous research adopted the usability and sociability as antecedents for the online knowledge sharing activities, this study further explores visual aesthetics and intrinsic motivation design as additional two antecedents. We propose a set of contextual gamification and social media strategies which apply self-determination theory to self-motivate students for online knowledge sharing. It was found the game and social media elements can motivate the user in the online interface. The implementation of game elements in online interface can engage users while encouraging their activities for learning. Thus intrinsic motivation was designed using a set of gamification and social media specifications to enhance students’ self-motivation for knowledge sharing activities. The research model with 53 items was tested for content validity to identify the initial measures for online knowledge sharing. Based on the content validity analysis, 20 items that does not fit into the criteria was discarded from the instrument. Our finding reveals that 33 items from usability, visual aesthetics, sociality and intrinsic motivation design can be used for initial development of online knowledge sharing model.},

Almost four years later we study how the simultaneous availability of SO and SO-PT impacted Brazilian software developers. A priori, the impact could have been either empowering or impeding. To address this question, we combine interviews, analysis of trace data from SO and SO-PT and a survey of 229 Brazilian software developers. Our results indicate that the developers recognize availability of the information, response speed and accessibility as strong points of SO, and lower barrier to entry and presence of Brazilian-specific information as strong points of SO-PT. In large, SO remains more popular than SO-PT, and SO-PT is not perceived as a viable alternative to SO.},

However, since gender is not explicitly recorded, it is typically inferred by automatic "gender guessers", based on cues derived from an individual's online presence, such as their name and profile picture. As opposed to self-reporting, used in earlier studies, gender guessers scale better, but their accuracy depends on the quantity and quality of data available in one's online profile.In this paper we evaluate the applicability of different gender guessing approaches on several datasets derived from Stack Overflow.

abstract = {Developer support forums are becoming more popular than ever. Crowdsourced knowledge is an essential resource for many developers yet it can raise concerns about the quality of the shared content. Most existing research efforts address the quality of answers posted by Q&amp;A community members. In this paper, we explore the quality of questions and propose a method of predicting the score of questions on Stack Overflow based on sixteen factors related to questions' format, content and interactions that occur in the post. We performed an extensive investigation to understand the relationship between the factors and the scores of questions. The multiple regression analysis shows that the question's length of the code, accepted answer score, number of tags and the count of views, comments and answers are statistically significantly associated with the scores of questions. Our findings can offer insights to community-based Q&amp;A sites for improving the content of the shared knowledge.},

abstract = {Software developers frequently solve development issues with the help of question and answer web forums, such as Stack Overflow (SO). While tags exist to support question searching and browsing, they are more related to technological aspects than to the question purposes. Tagging questions with their purpose can add a new dimension to the investigation of topics discussed in posts on SO. In this paper, we aim to automate such a classification of SO posts into seven question categories. As a first step, we have manually created a curated data set of 500 SO posts, classified into the seven categories. Using this data set, we apply machine learning algorithms (Random Forest and Support Vector Machines) to build a classification model for SO questions. We then experiment with 82 different configurations regarding the preprocessing of the text and representation of the input data. The results of the best performing models show that our models can classify posts into the correct question category with an average precision and recall of 0.88 and 0.87 when using Random Forest and the phrases indicating a question category as input data for the training. The obtained model can be used to aid developers in browsing SO discussions or researchers in building recommenders based on SO.},

abstract = {Globally, organisations have become more aware of the importance of knowledge to gain and sustain a competitive business advantage. However, many organisations have ignored the importance of knowledge sharing among employees within an organisation. Recently, organisational culture has emerged as a key factor influencing the extent of knowledge sharing between employees. This paper aims to investigate the role of specific dimensions of organisational culture in the success of knowledge sharing. One of these dimensions, suggested by Hofstede, examined the difference between means oriented and goal oriented organisational cultures. In a means oriented culture, people avoid taking risks, only exhibit a limited effort at their jobs and spend their time caught in a routine. In contrast, workers in a goal oriented culture tend to be concerned about what needs to be achieved, are willing to try new approaches and sometimes take risks. The current review investigated special relationships between knowledge sharing behaviours at the work place, with regard to means oriented and goals oriented organizational culture dimensions.},

abstract = {Duplicate questions on Stack Overflow are questions that are flagged as being conceptually equivalent to a previously posted question. Stack Overflow suggests that duplicate questions should not be discussed by users, but rather that attention should be redirected to their previously posted counterparts. Roughly 53\% of closed Stack Overflow posts are closed due to duplication. Despite their supposed overlapping content, user activity suggests duplicates may generate additional or superior answers. Approximately 9\% of duplicates receive more views than their original counterparts despite being closed.In this paper, we analyze duplicate questions from two perspectives. First, we analyze the experience of those who post duplicates using activity and reputation-based heuristics. Second, we compare the content of duplicates both in terms of their questions and answers to determine the degree of similarity between each duplicate pair. Through analysis of the MSR challenge dataset, we find that although duplicate questions are more likely to be created by inexperienced users, they often receive dissimilar answers to their original counterparts. Indeed, supplementary textual analysis using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques suggests duplicate questions provide additional information about the underlying concepts being discussed. We recommend that the Stack Overflow's duplication policy be revised to account for the benefits that leaving duplicate questions open may have for the developer community.},

Following such an approach, attention is turned to exploring the working relationships of employees through Social Network Analysis to determine the closeness of fit of employees against the workflows officially established by management. Such a combination of techniques extends the toolkit of methodological approaches in this space, and from a more practical viewpoint permits the process improvement workflow manager to consider how well matched employees are to their workflows.},

The knowledge sharing process covers a wide range of operations ranging from a course registration process to flight ticket buying. A good service could help both the service providers and the service users. The service users could get the right information at the right time and at the right place; whereas the service providers could reduce the amount of work created by uninformed users. In this paper, an electronic service framework (e-service) is proposed to assist the information service. This framework is based on an information retrieval technique to discover information. As a result, the information can be accessed at any place and any time. Furthermore, the issue of information quality is also a part of this framework. Each piece of information will be provided with tags and a weight. The tags will be used for categorization while the weight will be used to determine the quality of the information. Ultimately, the information will be evaluated by the users whose comments and scores will later be used to improve the system.},

abstract = {Stack Overflow is the largest Community-based Question Answering (CQA) site for software developers. Its popularity is mainly attributed to the timely answers provided by a great number of developers. When having problems in learning and using new technologies, developers resort to Stack Overflow for help. However, it is difficult to recommend questions to the potential answerers due to the huge numbers of questions. In order to improve the accuracy of question recommending, we need to find out the members who are interested in the fields related to the questions and match the ability of developers with the difficulty of questions. To do so, we need to pay close attention to the behavior of developers. This paper presents a model with two prediction approaches, namely, the traditional feature-based approach and LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) based approach. When a new question arrives, this model will use LDA method to label the question and indicate the proper category to which the question belongs according to latent semantic feature and content feature. Then, with the traditional features of the question and the asker information, the model will recommend the appropriate developers to answer this new question.},

abstract = {Community-based question answering (CQA) platforms are crowd-sourced services for sharing user expertise on various topics, from mechanical repairs to parenting. While they naturally build-in an online social network infrastructure, they carry a very different purpose from Facebook-like social networks, where users "hang-out" with their friends and tend to share more personal information. It is unclear, thus, how the privacy concerns and their correlation with user behavior in an online social network translate into a CQA platform. This study analyzes one year of recorded traces from a mature CQA platform to understand the association between users' privacy concerns as manifested by their account settings and their activity in the platform. The results show that privacy preference is correlated with behavior in the community in terms of engagement, retention, accomplishments and deviance from the norm. We find privacy-concerned users have higher qualitative and quantitative contributions, show higher retention, report more abuses, have higher perception on answer quality and have larger social circles. However, at the same time, these users also exhibit more deviant behavior than the users with public profiles.},

Despite efforts to prevent asking questions that have already been answered, the site contains duplicate questions. This may cause developers to unnecessarily wait for a question to be answered when it has already been asked and answered. The site currently depends on its moderators and users with high reputation to manually mark those questions as duplicates, which not only results in delayed responses but also requires additional efforts. In this paper, we first perform a manual investigation to understand why users submit duplicate questions in Stack Overflow. Based on our manual investigation we propose a classification technique that uses a number of carefully chosen features to identify duplicate questions. Evaluation using a large number of questions shows that our technique can detect duplicate questions with reasonable accuracy. We also compare our technique with DupPredictor, a state-of-the-art technique for detecting duplicate questions, and we found that our proposed technique has a better recall-rate than that technique.},

However, most of answerers are ordinary with just basic background knowledge in certain areas. To help askers to get their preferable answers, a set of possible expert users should be recommended. There have been some studies on the expert recommendation in CQA, the latest work models the user expertise under topics, where each topic is learnt based on the content and tags of questions and answers. Practically, such topics are too general, whereas question tags can be more informative and valuable than the topic of each question. In this paper, we study the user expertise under tags. Experimental analysis on a large data set from Stack Overflow demonstrates that our method performs better than the up-to-date method.},

abstract = {Knowledge would be considered as important element in knowledge-based economy and it makes a strong competitive advantage in dynamic business environment. In knowledge management, knowledge sharing is the most critical elements of effective knowledge processing. Several studies have been done to explain why people share knowledge and some of them have been mentioned in this paper. The next issue is how knowledge sharing can be improved and how it can be measured. Different models from different view points such as social and psychological aspect or economic benefit aspect have been proposed to analyse and measure knowledge sharing effectiveness. In this paper, we will review some of the main models in knowledge sharing effectiveness and will explain a new method to measure knowledge sharing effectiveness among individuals.},

Traditional process mining techniques have little consideration on social interactions, which are rich in online forums. We propose to complement traditional process mining with analyses on social interactions among discussion participants.

In addition, analyses on social interactions provide insights that verify and supplement the process mining results.},

The use of these technologies for knowledge sharing in organizational settings has been thoroughly examined and some positive effects have been found, but much less is known about how the social media tools could be effectively used in cross-organizational settings or in international cooperation. The aim of the study was to investigate what kind of knowledge sharing practices can be identified in international clusters; which tools are used for supporting the knowledge sharing in international networks and what kind of barriers the members perceive in their knowledge sharing processes within the network. The results indicated that communities are actively thinking about employing social technologies for knowledge sharing, but several barriers exists that hinder adoption. The study indicated that any tool could build the community sense and replace the face-to-face meetings in real life, but the technologies should be intertwined with real life communication and every community needs a facilitator who takes responsibilities for community building.},

In this study, the authors utilized a knowledge-sharing failure scenario to test the effects of status and culture on attributions with a survey conducted among 127 Chinese and 120 Koreans. The results showed that both Chinese and Koreans felt significantly more disappointed when the failure occurred because of the senior’s rather than the junior’s ability-related issues. Chinese participants tended to ascribe the failure significantly more to contexts than ability, while Korean participants had the opposite tendency. Although both Chinese and Korean participants gave lower ratings on motivation attribution when the one who failed to share knowledge was a peer, the gap was markedly larger for Korean participants. Further testing on self-construal revealed that Korean participants rated individualism significantly higher than their Chinese counterparts did. The results indicated that even in two similar cultures the status effects on attribution can differ. Managers of international companies should respond accordingly to group affairs regarding status issue.},

abstract = {Community Question Answering (CQA) is a popular online service for people asking and answering questions. Recently, with accumulation of users and contents in CQA platforms, their answer quality has aroused wide concern. Expert finding has been proposed as one way to address such problem, which aims at finding suitable answerers who can give high-quality answers. In this paper, we formalize expert finding as a learning to rank task by leveraging the user feedback on answers (i.e., the votes of answers) as the "relevance" labels. To achieve this task, we present a listwise learning to rank approach, which is referred to as ListEF. In the ListEF approach, realizing that questions in CQA are relatively short and usually attached with tags, we propose a tagword topic model (TTM) to derive high-quality topical representations of questions. Based on TTM, we develop a COmpetition-based User exPertise Extraction (COUPE) method to capture user expertise features for given questions. We adopt the widely used listwise learning to rank method LambdaMART to train the ranking function. Finally, for a given question, we rank candidate users in descending order of the scores calculated by the trained ranking function, and select the users with high rankings as candidate experts. Experimental results on Stack Overflow show both our TTM and ListEF approach are effective with significant improvements over state-of-art methods.},

abstract = {This paper proposes mining query subtopics from questions in community question answering (CQA). The subtopics are represented as a number of clusters of questions with keywords summarizing the clusters. The task is unique in that the subtopics from questions can not only facilitate user browsing in CQA search, but also describe aspects of queries from a question-answering perspective. The challenges of the task include how to group semantically similar questions and how to find keywords capable of summarizing the clusters. We formulate the subtopic mining task as a non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) problem and further extend the model of NMF to incorporate question similarity estimated from metadata of CQA into learning. Compared with existing methods, our method can jointly optimize question clustering and keyword extraction and encourage the former task to enhance the latter. Experimental results on large scale real world CQA datasets show that the proposed method significantly outperforms the existing methods in terms of keyword extraction, while achieving a comparable performance to the state-of-the-art methods for question clustering.},

abstract = {Collaborative web sites, such as collaborative encyclopedias, blogs, and forums, are characterized by a loose edit control, which allows anyone to freely edit their content. As a consequence, the quality of this content raises much concern. To deal with this, many sites adopt manual quality control mechanisms. However, given their size and change rate, manual assessment strategies do not scale and content that is new or unpopular is seldom reviewed. This has a negative impact on the many services provided, such as ranking and recommendation. To tackle with this problem, we propose a learning to rank (L2R) approach for ranking answers in Q&amp;A forums. In particular, we adopt an approach based on Random Forests and represent query and answer pairs using eight different groups of features. Some of these features are used in the Q&amp;A domain for the first time. Our L2R method was trained to learn the answer rating, based on the feedback users give to answers in Q&amp;A forums. Using the proposed method, we were able (i) to outperform a state of the art baseline with gains of up to 21\% in NDCG, a metric used to evaluate rankings; we also conducted a comprehensive study of the features, showing that (ii) review and user features are the most important in the Q&amp;A domain although text features are useful for assessing quality of new answers; and (iii) the best set of new features we proposed was able to yield the best quality rankings.},

The Stack Overflow community provides tag synonyms to reduce the number of tags that have the same or similar meaning. In our previous research, we used those synonym pairs to derive a number of strategies to create tag synonyms automatically.In this work, we continue this line of research and present an approach to group tag synonyms to meaningful topics. We represent our synonyms as directed, weighted graphs, and investigate several graph community detection algorithms to build meaningful groups of tags, also called tag communities.We apply our approach to the tags obtained from Android-related Stack Overflow posts and evaluate the resulting tag communities quantitatively with various community metrics. In addition, we evaluate our approach qualitatively through a manual inspection and comparison of a random sample of tag communities. Our results show that we can cluster the Android tags to 2,481 meaningful tag communities. We also show how these tag communities can be used to derive trends of topics of Android-related questions on Stack Overflow.},

Answers and Stack Overflow, are knowledge sharing platforms that allow users to post questions and answer questions asked by other users. One of the characteristics of CQA is a time lag between questions and answers. To reduce the time lag between them, various approaches have been suggested such as question retrieval and question routing. In this paper we propose a weighted question retrieval model that uses question titles, question descriptions, and their relationship for calculating question similarity in large-scale CQA archives. From the experiment our weighted question retrieval model outperforms the baseline that uses only question titles, and we found that exploiting the question descriptions increases the ranks of the relevant questions while reducing the recalls of them as compared with the baseline.},

In the last few decades, Web technologies have become widely used for Knowledge Management; these are called Knowledge Management Systems (KMS). Recently, in Knowledge Management (KM) the effectiveness of knowledge sharing has been considered a significant component for KMS success. In the most universities the KM is often inadequate when it comes to knowledge sharing, especially between academics. In order to encourage knowledge sharing, it is important to know why/where/when academics choose to contribute or to receive shared knowledge. Therefore, the purpose of this research is to investigate the factors that affect an academics' behavior towards knowledge sharing by using technology. Knowledge Sharing Technology model (KST) is proposed model was constructed combining the affecting factors: these factors are a synthesis of factors which already exist in current theories, i.e. the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) and Social Exchange Model (SET), as well as other factors which are always explored independently in research studies The future work will focus on confirming the model.},

Additionally, the informal text, typically present in forums, poses new challenges to the use of TKs. We compare our learning to rank (L2R) algorithms against a strong baseline given by the Google rank (GR). The results show that (i) our shallow structures used in TKs are robust enough to noisy data and (ii) improving GR requires effective BoW features and TKs along with an accurate model of GR features in the used L2R algorithm.},

abstract = {As a means to share knowledge, the community question answering (CQA) service provides users a chance to obtain or provide help by raising or answering questions. After a question is posted, the system must find an appropriate individual to answer this question. Several approaches have recently been proposed to find experts in CQA. In this paper, a new method to find experts in CQA is proposed by considering user post contents, answer votes, ratio of best answers, and user relation. The votes are used in post relation analysis to calculate user authority. The user's knowledge score can be calculated through topic analysis. Considering that a question usually includes many trivial words, an accurate distribution is nearly impossible to obtain with LDA. To solve this problem, vocabulary is extended by including the link information shown in a question, the top 10 relevant words from Wikipedia are provided for each tag. Tag-LDA models the user topic distribution and predicts the topic distribution of new questions. An experiment is conducted on Stack Overflow dataset, which is the world's largest computer programming CQA site. Experimental results showed approximately 2.97\% to 7.79\% performance improvement in nDCG@N metrics.},

abstract = {In this paper, we develop a content-cum-user based deep learning framework DeepTagRec to recommend appropriate question tags on Stack Overflow. The proposed system learns the content representation from question title and body. Subsequently, the learnt representation from heterogeneous relationship between user and tags is fused with the content representation for the final tag prediction. On a very large-scale dataset comprising half a million question posts, DeepTagRec beats all the baselines; in particular, it significantly outperforms the best performing baseline TagCombine achieving an overall gain of 60.8\% and 36.8\% in precision@3 and recall@10 respectively. DeepTagRec also achieves 63\% and 33.14\% maximum improvement in exact-k accuracy and top-k accuracy respectively over TagCombine.},

abstract = {This paper explores what motivates people to contribute knowledge in online communities and the effects that reputation management systems have on this motivation. An interpretivist case study of Stack Overflow was carried out. Seven categories of motivation were identified from the literature; fun, ideology, reputation, reciprocity, efficacy, attachment, and structural capital. Self-determination theory and the notion of knowledge as a public versus a private good were used as theoretical lenses to understand contributor motivation under each of these categories. Findings from the case identified important emergent themes such as the need for involvement in a community prior to contribution, and the importance of considering factors that discourage contribution in addition to those that encourage contribution when researching the contributor phenomenon.The paper argues that self-determination theory is a useful theoretical lens to apply to the study of contributor motivation, and whilst the notion of knowledge as a public versus a private good is useful to understanding some of the motivations found in the literature, increased complexity of knowledge sharing online communities reduces the utility of this theoretical lens, as evidenced by the case of Stack Overflow.},

title = {Improving recommendation of tail tags for questions in community question answering},
year = {2016},
publisher = {AAAI Press},
abstract = {We study tag recommendation for questions in community question answering (CQA). Tags represent the semantic summarization of questions are useful for navigation and expert finding in CQA and can facilitate content consumption such as searching and mining in these web sites. The task is challenging, as both questions and tags are short and a large fraction of tags are tail tags which occur very infrequently. To solve these problems, we propose matching questions and tags not only by themselves, but also by similar questions and similar tags. The idea is then formalized as a model in which we calculate question-tag similarity using a linear combination of similarity with similar questions and tags weighted by tag importance. Question similarity, tag similarity, and tag importance are learned in a supervised random walk framework by fusing multiple features. Our model thus can not only accurately identify question-tag similarity for head tags, but also improve the accuracy of recommendation of tail tags. Experimental results show that the proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on tag recommendation for questions. Particularly, it improves tail tag recommendation accuracy by a large margin.},

abstract = {Background Xu et al. used a deep neural network (DNN) technique to classify the degree of relatedness between two knowledge units (question-answer threads) on Stack Overflow. More recently, extending Xu et al.'s work, Fu and Menzies proposed a simpler classification technique based on a fine-tuned support vector machine (SVM) that achieves similar performance but in a much shorter time. Thus, they suggested that researchers need to compare their sophisticated methods against simpler alternatives.Aim The aim of this work is to replicate the previous studies and further investigate the validity of Fu and Menzies' claim by evaluating the DNN- and SVM-based approaches on a larger dataset. We also compare the effectiveness of these two approaches against SimBow, a lightweight SVM-based method that was previously used for general community question-answering.Method We (1) collect a large dataset containing knowledge units from Stack Overflow, (2) show the value of the new dataset addressing shortcomings of the original one, (3) re-evaluate both the DNN-and SVM-based approaches on the new dataset, and (4) compare the performance of the two approaches against that of SimBow.Results We find that: (1) there are several limitations in the original dataset used in the previous studies, (2) effectiveness of both Xu et al.'s and Fu and Menzies' approaches (as measured using F1-score) drop sharply on the new dataset, (3) similar to the previous finding, performance of SVM-based approaches (Fu and Menzies' approach and SimBow) are slightly better than the DNN-based approach, (4) contrary to the previous findings, Fu and Menzies' approach runs much slower than DNN-based approach on the larger dataset - its runtime grows sharply with increase in dataset size, and (5) SimBow outperforms both Xu et al. and Fu and Menzies' approaches in terms of runtime.Conclusion We conclude that, for this task, simpler approaches based on SVM performs adequately well. We also illustrate the challenges brought by the increased size of the dataset and show the benefit of a lightweight SVM-based approach for this task.},

Detecting and eliminating toxic and divisive content in these Q&amp;A sites are paramount tasks to ensure a safe and constructive environment for the users. Insincere question, which is founded upon false premises, is one type of toxic content in Q&amp;A sites. In this paper, we proposed a novel deep learning framework enhanced pre-trained word embeddings with topical information for insincere question classification. We evaluated our proposed framework on a large real-world dataset from Quora Q&amp;A site and showed that the topically enhanced word embedding is able to achieve better results in toxic content classification. An empirical study was also conducted to analyze the topics of the insincere questions on Quora, and we found that topics on "religion", "gender" and "politics" has a higher proportion of insincere questions.},

abstract = {Community-based question answering platforms can be rich sources of information on a variety of specialized topics, from finance to cooking. The usefulness of such platforms depends heavily on user contributions (questions and answers), but also on respecting the community rules. As a crowd-sourced service, such platforms rely on their users for monitoring and flagging content that violates community rules. Common wisdom is to eliminate the users who receive many flags. Our analysis of a year of traces from a mature Q&amp;A site shows that the number of flags does not tell the full story: on one hand, users with many flags may still contribute positively to the community. On the other hand, users who never get flagged are found to violate community rules and get their accounts suspended. This analysis, however, also shows that abusive users are betrayed by their network properties: we find strong evidence of homophilous behavior and use this finding to detect abusive users who go under the community radar. Based on our empirical observations, we build a classifier that is able to detect abusive users with an accuracy as high as 83\%.},

Since all these people want to develop, test, architect software, and are reluctant to document it, a lot of this knowledge remains tacit. This is the more so in agile environments, where there is an inherent tension between top-down development guidance through specifications and other means, and a bottom-up development and delivery of new features. In multi-site development, such may easily lead to mutual misunderstandings, an increase in errors and problem reports, and wasting resources on rework. I will report on knowledge sharing challenges we encountered in industry, in particular in a large multi-site development organization that develops software for the printing industry.},

abstract = {Modern software system stacks are composed of large numbers of software components. These components may include a broad range of entities such as services, libraries, and frameworks, all intended to address specific requirements. It is not only necessary that these components satisfy respective functional and non-functional concerns, but also that the combinations of selected components work well together. The space of component combinations to explore is huge. Together with the almost universal lack of formal documentation suggesting desirable combinations and cautioning against undesirable ones, this renders the proper selection of combinations very challenging. For this reason, software engineers often solicit advice and document their experience on online forums such as community Q&amp;A sites. In this paper, we show that these Q&amp;A sites contain valuable knowledge about inter-component relations. We develop an approach using information extraction techniques to automatically identify three different types of compatibility relations from unstructured text on Q&amp;A site postings. Our work demonstrates that identifying such relations is valuable for the design of component-based systems and that automatic relation extraction is a promising technique to systematically harness such community knowledge.},

We devise an approach to quantify code explanations and apply it to ~300K posts. We find that it causes up to a 5σ (single-tail significant) increase in precision over baseline prediction times. This supports the use of our approach as an 'edit suggestion': Questions with a low score could trigger a warning suggesting the user to better explain the included code.},

An important and challenging task is to identify reliable and trusted experts on large popular CQA platforms. State-of-the-art graph-based approaches to expertise estimation consider only user-user interactions without taking the relative contribution of individual answers into account, while pairwise-comparison approaches consider only pairs involving the best-answerer of each question. This research argues that there is a need to account for the user's relative contribution towards solving the question when estimating user expertise and proposes a content-agnostic measure of user contributions. This addition is incorporated into a competition-based approach for ranking users' question answering ability. The paper analyses how improvements in user expertise estimation impact on applications in expert search and answer quality prediction. Experiments using the Yahoo!

abstract = {Online learning has been getting popular in higher education. Key functionalities of online learning environment include the access to a wider perspective of learning resources and the provision of social interactions between instructor-learners and among learners-learners. Recent empirical findings in online learning have acknowledged the importance of online knowledge sharing as an integral part of online learning, through the various forms of learner interactions within online learning environment, such as discussion forums, collaborative learning and communities building. However, recent studies still find mixed results that instructors and students are not always fully engaged in online learning activities. Without frequent and persistent interactions, it is doubtful whether online knowledge sharing could really take place in online learning environment. Thus, the present study examines prior literature to explore the motivational factors to online knowledge sharing. It is found that perceived online attachment motivation and perceived online relationship commitment are two determinants to online knowledge sharing. As a result of the literature review, theoretical propositions are developed to explain online knowledge sharing. Discussion section explains the theoretical and practical implications.},

Stack Overflow believes in the power of community editing, which means that one is able to edit questions without the changes going through peer review. Stack Overflow users may make edits to questions for a variety of reasons, among others, to improve the question and try to obtain more answers. However, to date the relationship between edit actions on questions and the number of answers that they collect is unknown. In this paper, we perform an empirical study on Stack Overflow to understand the relationship between edit actions and number of answers obtained in different dimensions from different attributes of the edited questions. We find that questions are more commonly edited by question owners, on bodies with relatively big changes before obtaining an accepted answer. However, edited questions that obtained more answers in a shorter time, were edited by other users rather than question owners, and their edits tended to be small, focused on titles and in adding addendums.},

abstract = {Context: Stack Overflow is a popular community question and answer portal used by practitioners to solve problems during software development. Developers can focus their attention on answers that have been accepted or where members have recorded high votes in judging good answers when searching for help. However, the latter mechanism (votes) can be unreliable, and there is currently no way to differentiate between an answer that is likely to be accepted and those that will not be accepted by looking at the answer's characteristics. Objective: In potentially providing a mechanism to identify acceptable answers, this study examines the features that distinguish an accepted answer from an unaccepted answer. Methods: We studied the Stack Overflow dataset by analyzing questions and answers for the two most popular tags (Java and JavaScript). Our dataset comprised 249,588 posts drawn from 2014-2016. We use random forest and neural network models to predict accepted answers, and study the features with the highest predictive power in those two models. Results: Our findings reveal that the length of code in answers, reputation of users, similarity of the text between questions and answers, and the time lag between questions and answers have the highest predictive power for differentiating accepted and unaccepted answers. Conclusion: Tools may leverage these findings in supporting developers and reducing the effort they must dedicate to searching for suitable answers on Stack Overflow.},

abstract = {User votes are important signals in community question-answering (CQA) systems. Many features of typical CQA systems, e.g. the best answer to a question, status of a user, are dependent on ratings or votes cast by the community. In a popular CQA site, Yahoo! Answers, users vote for the best answers to their questions and can also thumb up or down each individual answer. Prior work has shown that these votes provide useful predictors for content quality and user expertise, where each vote is usually assumed to carry the same weight as others. In this paper, we analyze a set of possible factors that indicate bias in user voting behavior -- these factors encompass different gaming behavior, as well as other eccentricities, e.g., votes to show appreciation of answerers. These observations suggest that votes need to be calibrated before being used to identify good answers or experts. To address this problem, we propose a general machine learning framework to calibrate such votes. Through extensive experiments based on an editorially judged CQA dataset, we show that our supervised learning method of content-agnostic vote calibration can significantly improve the performance of answer ranking and expert ranking.},

abstract = {Online knowledge-sharing networks, such as wikis and Question-Answering (Q&amp;A) portals, offer a rich environment where people can collaborate and share knowledge on specific topics pertaining to their interests and expertise. The continued collaboration of groups of users who share interests in the same topics essentially make up communities, which are here referred to as topic-based communities. Analyzing the dynamics of such communities is key to understanding network processes such as the flow of users and information in the network. In this paper, we study how users relate to topic-based communities and how such relationship shapes long-term community dynamics. Using a large dataset collected from Stack Overflow, a popular programming oriented Q&amp;A site, we investigate several factors related to the evolution of communities in the site, such as user participation and the importance of revisits for community sustainability. Moreover, we develop a model to describe community evolution based on user activity which incorporates key aspects of community dynamics, including member revisits and the flow of users across related communities.},

Many of these medium-sized and small companies have an aspiration to grow. However, getting a company onto a path of sustainable growth is not an easy task. Although some previous studies have argued that knowledge sharing can be one potential way to support growth, other studies suggest that knowledge sharing is, in fact, a highly challenging task, even a problem, for a growing company. By drawing on previous studies on knowledge sharing barriers and different growth paths in the context of software business, this paper aims to increase our understanding of the knowledge sharing challenges that software companies may face in different growth paths.},

abstract = {This paper studies the problem of question retrieval in community question answering (CQA). To bridge lexical gaps in questions, which is regarded as the biggest challenge in retrieval, state-of-the-art methods learn translation models using answers under an assumption that they are parallel texts. In practice, however, questions and answers are far from "parallel". Indeed, they are heterogeneous for both the literal level and user behaviors. There are a particularly large number of low quality answers, to which the performance of translation models is vulnerable. To address these problems, we propose a supervised question-answer topic modeling approach. The approach assumes that questions and answers share some common latent topics and are generated in a "question language" and "answer language" respectively following the topics. The topics also determine an answer quality signal. Compared with translation models, our approach not only comprehensively models user behaviors on CQA portals, but also highlights the instinctive heterogeneity of questions and answers. More importantly, it takes answer quality into account and performs robustly against noise in answers. With the topic modeling approach, we propose a topic-based language model, which matches questions not only on a term level but also on a topic level. We conducted experiments on large scale data from Yahoo! Answers and Baidu Knows. Experimental results show that the proposed model can significantly outperform state-of-the-art retrieval models in CQA.},

abstract = {This paper proposes knowledge sharing and cooperation based Adaptive Boosting (KSC-AdaBoost) for supervised collaborative learning in presence of two different feature spaces (views) representing a training example. In such a binary learner space, two learner agents are trained on the two feature spaces. Difficulty of a training example is ascertained not only by classification performance of an individual learner but also by overall group performance on that training example. Group learning is enhanced by a novel algorithm for assigning weight to training set data. Three different models of KSC-AdaBoost are proposed for agglomerating decisions of the two learners. KSC-AdaBoost outperforms traditional AdaBoost and some recent variants of AdaBoost in terms of convergence rate of training set error and generalization accuracy. The paper then presents KSC-AdaBoost based hierarchical model for accurate eye region localization followed by fuzzy rule based system for robust eye center detection. Exhaustive experiments on five publicly available popular datasets reveal the viability of the learning models and superior eye detection accuracy over recent state-of-the-art algorithms.},

abstract = {We study the problem of question retrieval in community question answering (CQA). The biggest challenge within this task is lexical gaps between questions since similar questions are usually expressed with different but semantically related words. To bridge the gaps, state-of-the-art methods incorporate extra information such as word-to-word translation and categories of questions into the traditional language models. We find that the existing language model based methods can be interpreted using a new framework, that is they represent words and question categories in a vector space and calculate question-question similarities with a linear combination of dot products of the vectors. The problem is that these methods are either heuristic on data representation or difficult to scale up. We propose a principled and efficient approach to learning representations of data in CQA. In our method, we simultaneously learn vectors of words and vectors of question categories by optimizing an objective function naturally derived from the framework. In question retrieval, we incorporate learnt representations into traditional language models in an effective and efficient way. We conduct experiments on large scale data from Yahoo! Answers and Baidu Knows, and compared our method with state-of-the-art methods on two public data sets. Experimental results show that our method can significantly improve on baseline methods for retrieval relevance. On 1 million training data, our method takes less than 50 minutes to learn a model on a single multicore machine, while the translation based language model needs more than 2 days to learn a translation table on the same machine.},

abstract = {Nowadays information systems play a vital role for organizations and individuals, which is why their protection is becoming increasingly important. Often, solutions are developed for very similar problems over and over again. An exchange of knowledge between experts would be desirable in order to prevent developing always the same solutions by independent persons. Such an exchange could also lead to solutions of higher quality, as existing approaches could be advanced, instead of always reinventing the security wheel. This paper examines how machine-readable information security knowledge can be shared between different organizations on the basis of a web portal utilizing Web-Prot'{e}g'{e}. It can be shown that through the use of ontologies the domain of information security can be modeled and stored in a human- and a machine-readable format, enabling both human editing and automation (e.g. for risk calculations). The evaluation of the web portal has shown that the most important challenge a tool for knowledge sharing has to face is the aspect of motivating users to participate in a knowledge exchange.},

abstract = {The amount of diverse tags used to classify posts on Stack Overflow increased in the last years to more than 38,000 tags. Many of these tags have the same or similar meaning. Stack Overflow provides an approach to reduce the amount of tags by allowing privileged users to manually create synonyms. However, currently exist only 2,765 synonym-pairs on Stack Overflow that is quite low compared to the total number of tags.To comprehend how synonym-pairs are built, we manually analyzed the tags and how the synonyms could be created automatically. Based on our findings, we then present TSST, a tag synonym suggestion tool, that outputs a ranked list of possible synonyms for each input tag.We first evaluated TSST with the 2,765 approved synonym-pairs of Stack Overflow. For 88.4\% of the tags TSST finds the correct synonyms, for 72.2\% the correct synonym is within the top 10 suggestions. In addition, we applied TSST to 10 randomly selected Android related tags and evaluated the suggested synonyms with 20 Android app developers in an online survey. Overall, in 80\% of their ratings, developers found an adequate synonym suggested by TSST.},

abstract = {Community Question Answering (CQA) websites, which archive millions of questions and answers created by CQA users to provide a rich resource of information that is missing at web search engines and QA websites, have become increasingly popular. Web users who search for answers to their questions at CQA websites, however, are often required to either (i) wait for days until other CQA users post answers to their questions which might even be incorrect, offensive, or spam, or (ii) deal with restricted answer sets created by CQA websites due to the exact-match constraint that is employed and imposed between archived questions and user-formulated questions. To automate and enhance the process of locating high-quality answers to a user's question Q at a CQA website, we introduce a CQA refinement system, called QAR. Given Q, QAR first retrieves a set of CQA questions QS that are the same as, or similar to, Q in terms of its specified information need. Thereafter, QAR selects as answers to Q the top-ranked answers (among the ones to the questions in QS) based on various similarity scores and the length of the answers. Empirical studies, which were conducted using questions provided by the Text Retrieval Conference (TREC) and Text Analysis Conference (TAC), in addition to more than four millions questions (and their corresponding answers) extracted from Yahoo! Answers, show that QAR is effective in locating archived answers, if they exist, that satisfy the information need specified in Q. We have further assessed the performance of QAR by comparing its question-matching and answer-ranking strategies with their Yahoo! Answers' counterparts and verified that QAR outperforms Yahoo! Answers in (i) locating the set of questions QS that have the highest degrees of similarity with Q and (ii) ranking archived answers to QS as answers to Q.},

However, obtaining an easy-to-understand documentation is a challenge faced by developers. Several papers have proposed alternatives to make API documentation more understandable, or even more detailed. However, these studies have not taken into account the complexity of examples in order to make documentation adaptable to different levels of developer experience. In this work, we developed and evaluated four different methodologies to generate tutorials for APIs from the contents of Stack Overflow and organize them according to the complexity of understanding. The methodologies were evaluated through tutorials generated for the Swing API. A survey was conducted to evaluate eight different features of the generated tutorials. The overall outcome was positive on several characteristics, showing the feasibility of automatically generated tutorials. In addition, the adoption of features for presenting tutorial elements in order of complexity, for separating the tutorial in basic and advanced parts, for selecting posts with a tutorial nature and with didactic source code had significantly better results regarding the generation methodology.},

This rapid growth, while offering new opportunities, puts forward new challenges. In most CQA implementations there is little effort in directing new questions to the right group of experts. This means that experts are not provided with questions matching their expertise, and therefore new matching questions may be missed and not receive a proper answer. We focus on finding experts for a newly posted question. We investigate the suitability of two statistical topic models for solving this issue and compare these methods against more traditional Information Retrieval approaches. We show that for a dataset constructed from the Stackoverflow website, these topic models outperform other methods in retrieving a candidate set of best experts for a question. We also show that the Segmented Topic Model gives consistently better performance compared to the Latent Dirichlet Allocation Model.},

Based on a development set of 1,574 sentences, we compare the performance of two state-of-the-art summarization techniques as well as a pattern-based approach for insight sentence extraction. We then present SISE, a novel machine learning based approach that uses as features the sentences themselves, their formatting, their question, their answer, and their authors as well as part-of-speech tags and the similarity of a sentence to the corresponding API documentation. With SISE, we were able to achieve a precision of 0.64 and a coverage of 0.7 on the development set. In a comparative study with eight software developers, we found that SISE resulted in the highest number of sentences that were considered to add useful information not found in the API documentation. These results indicate that taking into account the meta data available on Stack Overflow as well as part-of-speech tags can significantly improve unsupervised extraction approaches when applied to Stack Overflow data.},

abstract = {Community Question Answering (CQA) services, such as Yahoo! Answers, are specifically designed to address the innate limitation of Web search engines by helping users obtain information from a community. Understanding the user intent of questions would enable a CQA system identify similar questions, find relevant answers, and recommend potential answerers more effectively and efficiently. In this paper, we propose to classify questions into three categories according to their underlying user intent: subjective, objective, and social. In order to identify the user intent of a new question, we build a predictive model through machine learning based on both text and metadata features. Our investigation reveals that these two types of features are conditionally independent and each of them is sufficient for prediction. Therefore they can be exploited as two views in co-training - a semi-supervised learning framework - to make use of a large amount of unlabelled questions, in addition to the small set of manually labelled questions, for enhanced question classification. The preliminary experimental results show that co-training works significantly better than simply pooling these two types of features together.},

abstract = {The research on community question answering (CQA) has been paid increasing attention in recent years. In CQA, to reduce the number of unanswered questions and the time for askers to wait, it is very necessary to identify relevant experts or best answers for these questions. Generally, the experts' answers are more likely to be the best answers. Existing studies considered that user expertise is reflected by the voting scores of both answers and questions. However, voting scores of questions are not really related to user expertise. In this paper, we proposed a new probabilistic model to depict users' expertise based on answers and their descriptive ability based on questions. To exploit social information in CQA, the link analysis is also considered. Extensive experiments on the large Stack Overflow dataset demonstrate that our methods can achieve comparable or even better performance than the state-of-the-art models.},

abstract = {In recent times, gamification has become a popular technique to aid online communities stimulate active member participation. Gamification promotes a reward-driven approach, usually measured by response-time. Possible concerns of gamification could a trade-off between speedy over quality responses. Conversely, bias toward easier question selection for maximum reward may exist. In this study, we analyze the distribution gamification-influenced tendencies on the Q&amp;A Stack Overflow online community. In addition, we define some gamification-influenced metrics related to response time to a question post. We carried experiments of a four-month period analyzing 101,291 members posts. Over this period, we determined a Rapid Response time of 327 seconds (5.45 minutes). Key findings suggest that around 92\% of SO members have fewer rapid responses that non-rapid responses. Accepted answers have no clear relationship with rapid responses. However, we did find that rapid responses significantly contain tags that did not follow their usual tagging tendencies.},

Stack Overflow provides an approach to reduce the amount of tags by allowing privileged users to manually create synonyms. However, currently exist only 2,765 synonym-pairs on Stack Overflow that is quite low compared to the total number of tags. To comprehend how synonym-pairs are built, we manually analyzed the tags and how the synonyms could be created automatically. Based on our findings, we then present TSST, a tag synonym suggestion tool, that outputs a ranked list of possible synonyms for each input tag. We first evaluated TSST with the 2,765 approved synonym-pairs of Stack Overflow. For 88.4\% of the tags TSST finds the correct synonyms, for 72.2\% the correct synonym is within the top 10 suggestions. In addition, we applied TSST to 10 ran-domly selected Android related tags and evaluated the suggested synonyms with 20 Android app developers in an online survey. Overall, in 80\% of their ratings, developers found an adequate synonym suggested by TSST.},

However, creating these models require parallel data between natural language (NL) and code with fine-grained alignments. Stack Overflow (SO) is a promising source to create such a data set: the questions are diverse and most of them have corresponding answers with high quality code snippets. However, existing heuristic methods (e.g., pairing the title of a post with the code in the accepted answer) are limited both in their coverage and the correctness of the NL-code pairs obtained. In this paper, we propose a novel method to mine high-quality aligned data from SO using two sets of features: hand-crafted features considering the structure of the extracted snippets, and correspondence features obtained by training a probabilistic model to capture the correlation between NL and code using neural networks. These features are fed into a classifier that determines the quality of mined NL-code pairs. Experiments using Python and Java as test beds show that the proposed method greatly expands coverage and accuracy over existing mining methods, even when using only a small number of labeled examples. Further, we find that reasonable results are achieved even when training the classifier on one language and testing on another, showing promise for scaling NL-code mining to a wide variety of programming languages beyond those for which we are able to annotate data.},

By allowing the users to contribute knowledge, CQA not only satisfies the question askers but also provides valuable references to other users with similar queries. Due to a large volume of questions, not all questions get fully answered. As a result, it can be useful to route a question to a potential answerer. In this paper, we present a question routing scheme which takes into account the answering, commenting and voting propensities of the users. Unlike prior work which focuses on routing a question to the most desirable expert, we focus on routing it to a group of users - who would be willing to collaborate and provide useful answers to that question. Through empirical evidence, we show that more answers and comments are desirable for improving the lasting value of a question-answer thread. As a result, our focus is on routing a question to a team of compatible users. We propose a recommendation model that takes into account the compatibility, topical expertise and availability of the users. Our experiments over a large real-world dataset shows the effectiveness of our approach over several baseline models.},

Answers and WikiAnswers, have become popular with users as one of the central paradigms for satisfying users' information needs. The task of question retrieval aims to resolve one's query directly by finding the most relevant questions (together with their answers) from an archive of past questions. However, as the text of each question is short, there is usually a lexical gap between the queried question and the past questions. To alleviate this problem, we present a hybrid approach that blends several language modelling techniques for question retrieval, namely, the classic (query-likelihood) language model, the state-of-the-art translation-based language model, and our proposed semantics-based language model. The semantics of each candidate question is given by a probabilistic topic model which makes use of local and global semantic graphs for capturing the hidden interactions among entities (e.g., people, places, and concepts) in question-answer pairs. Experiments on two real-world datasets show that our approach can significantly outperform existing ones.},

Objective: This study aims at empirically studying the key motivators, practices, and drawbacks of artifact-based knowledge sharing for achieving common understanding of technical specifications in the context of GSD. Method: We conducted an exploratory case study in an organization that was involved in several GSD projects. Results: Our findings revealed the key challenges that necessitated the use of artifacts for sharing technical specification knowledge. We also present the practices that make up the artifact-based knowledge sharing system in the studied case. Finally, we shed some light on the caveats of knowledge sharing practices adopted by the studied company. The findings can provide useful insights into the artifact-based knowledge sharing practices and how it can be complemented by having certain level of social ties among distributed team members, even through asynchronous means.},

abstract = {With the rapid development of online Knowledge Sharing Communities (KSCs), the problem of finding experts becomes increasingly important for knowledge propagation and putting crowd wisdom to work. A recent development trend of KSCs is to allow users to add text tags for annotating their posts, which are more accurate than traditional category information. However, how to leverage these user-generated tags for finding experts is still under-explored. To this end, in this paper, we develop a novel approach for finding experts in tag based KSCs by leveraging tag context and the semantic relationship between tags. Specifically, the extracted prior knowledge and user profiles are first used for enriching the query tags to infer tag context, which represents the user's latent information needs. Then, a topic model based approach is applied for capturing the semantic relationship between tags and then taking advantage of them for ranking user authority. We evaluate the proposed framework for expert finding on a large-scale real-world data set collected from a tag based Chinese commercial Q&amp;A web site. Experimental results clearly show that the proposed method outperforms several baseline methods with a significant margin.},

We analyze a large log of web queries that landed on Yahoo Answers site, showing a strong deviation between the tendencies of different document words to appear in a landing (click-through) query given their syntactic function. To this end, we propose a novel term weighting method that makes use of the syntactic information available for each query term occurrence in the document, on top of term occurrence statistics. The relative importance of each feature is learned via a learning to rank algorithm that utilizes a click-through query log. We examine the new weighting scheme using manual evaluation based on editorial data and using automatic evaluation over the query log. Our experimental results show consistent improvement in retrieval when syntactic information is taken into account.},

Social technologies include both (a) traditional social technologies (e.g., email, phone and instant messengers) and (b) emerging social networking technologies commonly known as social media such as blogs, wikis, major public social networking sites (i.e., Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn), and enterprise social networking technologies employed behind a firewall. Building from sociomateriality research, I study how these social technologies, as a suite of tools, are used in combination. The primary outcome of this research is a more complete conceptualization of the role and value of various social technologies for knowledge sharing in organizational contexts, which still remains understudied within the CSCW arena.},

abstract = {Software testing represents an important activity to achieve quality during mobile application development. The constant evolution of mobile applications in previous years relating to size and complexity entails the need to improve testing techniques and tools. In this context, developers/testers often resort to specialized communities or Question \&amp; Answer repositories to clarity doubts regarding testing in a practical and efficient way. Thus, these repositories become a popular source of data to understand the current context of software testing practices. In this paper, we present a study using the Stack Overflow repository for analyzing and clustering the main topics on Android testing. We employed the LDA algorithm to summarize the mobile testing related questions. Our findings show that topics such as testing tools, functional testing, and unit testing are often discussed when compared to other topics. We also analyzed the evolution of the interest of Android testing tools. Results show that developers are more interested in Appium, Espresso, Monkey, and Robotium tools.},

abstract = {Relevant question retrieval and ranking is a typical task in community question answering (CQA). Existing methods mainly focus on long and syntactically structured queries. However, when an input query is short, the task becomes challenging, due to a lack information regarding user intent. In this paper, we mine different types of user intent from various sources for short queries. With these intent signals, we propose a new intent-based language model. The model takes advantage of both state-of-the-art relevance models and the extra intent information mined from multiple sources. We further employ a state-of-the-art learning-to-rank approach to estimate parameters in the model from training data. Experiments show that by leveraging user intent prediction, our model significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art relevance models in question search.},

abstract = {Stack Overflow is a highly successful Community Question Answering (CQA) service for software developers with more than three millions users and more than ten thousand posts per day. The large volume of questions makes it difficult for users to find questions that they are interested in answering. In this paper, we propose a number of approaches to predict who will answer a new question using the characteristics of the question (i.e. Topic) and users (i.e. Reputation), and the social network of Stack Overflow users (i.e. Interested in the same topic). Specifically, our approach aims to identify a group of users (candidates) who have the potential to answer a new question by using feature-based prediction approach and social network based prediction approach. We develop predictive models to predict whether an identified candidate answers a new question. This prediction helps motivate the knowledge exchanging in the community by routing relevant questions to potential answerers. The evaluation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our predictive models, achieving 44\% precision, 59\% recall, and 49\% F-measure (average across all test sets). In addition, our candidate identification techniques can identify the answerers who actually answer questions up to 12.8\% (average across all test sets).},

In contrast to Q&amp;A websites, which are strongly tied to practitioners' needs, there are systematic reviews (SRs), which, according to recent studies, lack a connection with software engineering practice. In this paper, we investigate this claim by assessing to what extent systematic reviews help to solve questions posted on Q&amp;A websites. To achieve this goal, we propose and evaluate a coverage method. We applied this method to a set of more than 600 questions related to agile software development. Results suggest that 12\% of the related questions were covered. When considering specific agile methods, the majority of them have coverage below 50\% or were not covered at all. We also identified 27 recurrent questions.},

abstract = {In a post disaster scenario, assessment of resource needs is indeed challenging because needs are constantly changing and supplies trickle in at an uncertain rate. Moreover, information about resource needs of far-flung areas get rarely permeated owing to the disruption of cellular and other communication infrastructure, leading to a huge gap in perception about the actual needs in those areas. Therefore, a dynamic need assessment mechanism is essential to stay abreast of the actual situation. Movements of volunteers and relief workers are governed by two dominant characteristics of human mobility - spatial locality and spatial regularity. In this paper, we make use of such mobility characteristics to propose a knowledge sharing based approach for dynamic assessment of post disaster resource needs using a smart-phone based delay tolerant network (DTN). The proposed technique caters to the objective of bridging the gap in perception about actual resource needs.},

abstract = {MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play important roles in various biological processes by regulating their target genes. Therefore, miRNAs are closely associated with development, diagnosis, and prognosis for many diseases. The prediction of miRNA targets remains a challenging task for biologists because it involves an extremely large amount of data sources to be explored: to manually integrate information of identified targets and related information from various sources is time-consuming and error-prone; most of all, it is subject to biologists' limited prior knowledge. In this paper we investigated an ontology-based knowledge sharing framework to assist biologists in unraveling important roles of miRNAs in human disease in an automated and more efficient manner, (i) We developed the very first domain-specific ontologies in the miRNA field, Ontology for MicroRNA Target (OMIT), (ii) According to the global metadata model defined in ontologies, heterogeneous data sources were annotated and seamlessly integrated and stored into a central Resource Description Framework (RDF) data repository, (iii) We then enabled ontology-based queries, instead of traditional SQL queries, by inferring new statements from RDF data triples. Consequently we were able to acquire hidden knowledge originally implicit and unclear, yet critical, to biologists.},

Using data from Stack Overflow, we examined the profile data of users in order to determine the relationship between a complete profile (one that has values for each profile element: website URL, location, about me, profile image and age) and their contribution to the network in terms of reputation scores and quality of question and answer posts. Our analysis shows that most users do not have a complete profile, however the average reputation earned by users with complete profiles is significantly higher than that earned by users with incomplete profiles. In addition, users with complete profiles post higher quality question and answers, hence are more useful to the network. We also determined that, of the five profile elements studied, location and about me have a higher correlation than the others. This research is a step in determining what profile elements are important in a typical Q&amp;A social network and which of these elements should regularly be used together.},

abstract = {Witkeys are a thriving type of web-based knowledge sharing market in China, supporting a form of crowdsourcing. In a Witkey site, users offer a small award for a solution to a task, and other users compete to have their solution selected.In this paper, we examine the behavior of users on one of the biggest Witkey websites in China, Taskcn.com. On Taskcn, we observed several characteristics in users' activity over time. Most users become inactive after only a few submissions. Others keep attempting tasks. Over time, users tend to select tasks where they are competing against fewer opponents to increase their chances of winning. They will also, perhaps counterproductively, select tasks with higher expected rewards. Yet, on average, they do not increase their chances of winning, and in some categories of tasks, their chances actually decrease. This does not paint the full picture, however, because there is a very small core of successful users who manage not only to win multiple tasks, but to increase their win-to-submission ratio over time. This core group proposes nearly 20\% of the winning solutions on the site. The patterns we observe on Taskcn, we believe, hold clues to the future of crowdsourcing and freelance marketplaces, and raise interesting design implications for such sites.},

Since the number of programmers who use these websites are increasing and a large number of questions and answers are being posted there by them, verifying the quality of all the answers and particularly the code snippets in them is impossible. Consequently, some code snippets might be of low quality and/or with faults. To mitigate this issue, we introduce ExRec (&lt;u&gt;Ex&lt;/u&gt;ample &lt;u&gt;Rec&lt;/u&gt;ommender), an Eclipse plugin with which programmers can contribute in improving the quality of code snippets in the answers to questions in the Stack Overow website. Using ExRec, a programmer can transfer a code snippet in the answer to a desired question in Stack Overow to her own program, apply her desired modifications to that code snippet, and then contribute the improved code snippet to Stack Overow as an answer to that particular question. Our evaluations of ExRec in a user study with 10 skilled programmers indicate that it is effective in practice and can help in improving the quality of code snippets in Stack Overow.},

abstract = {This paper focuses on the problem of Question Routing (QR) in Community Question Answering (CQA), which aims to route newly posted questions to the potential answerers who are most likely to answer them. Traditional methods to solve this problem only consider the text similarity features between the newly posted question and the user profile, while ignoring the important statistical features, including the question-specific statistical feature and the user-specific statistical features. Moreover, traditional methods are based on unsupervised learning, which is not easy to introduce the rich features into them. This paper proposes a general framework based on the learning to rank concepts for QR. Training sets consist of triples (q, asker, answerers) are first collected. Then, by introducing the intrinsic relationships between the asker and the answerers in each CQA session to capture the intrinsic labels/orders of the users about their expertise degree of the question q, two different methods, including the SVM-based and RankingSVM-based methods, are presented to learn the models with different example creation processes from the training set. Finally, the potential answerers are ranked using the trained models. Extensive experiments conducted on a real world CQA dataset from Stack Overflow show that our proposed two methods can both outperform the traditional query likelihood language model (QLLM) as well as the state-of-the-art Latent Dirichlet Allocation based model (LDA). Specifically, the RankingSVM-based method achieves statistical significant improvements over the SVM-based method and has gained the best performance.},

abstract = {Q&amp;A sites like Quora aim at growing the world's knowledge. In order to do this, they need to get the right questions to the right people to answer them, but also the existing answers to people who are interested in them. In order to accomplish this, they need to build a complex ecosystem where issues such as content quality, engagement, demand, interests, or reputation are taken into account. It is not possible to build a system like this unless most of the process are highly automated and scalable. The good news is that using high-quality data you can build machine learning solutions that can help address all of the previous requirements.In this talk I will describe some interesting uses of machine learning for Q&amp;A that range from different recommendation approaches such as personalized ranking to classifiers built to detect duplicate questions or spam. I will describe some of the modeling and feature engineering approaches that go into building these systems. I will also share some of the challenges faced when building such a large-scale knowledge base of human-generated knowledge. Finally, I will describe some of the unresolved research challenges in the Q&amp;A Space.I will use my experience at Quora as the main driving example. Quora is a Q&amp;A site that despite having over 80 million unique visitors a month, it is known for keeping a high-quality of answers and content in general.},

abstract = {Norms are behavioral expectations in communities. Online communities are also expected to abide by the established practices that are expressed in the code of conduct of a system. Even though community authorities continuously prompt their users to follow the regulations, it is observed that hate speech and abusive language usage are on the rise. In this paper, we quantify and analyze the patterns of violations of normative behaviour among the users of Stack Overflow (SO) – a well-known technical question-answer site for professionals and enthusiast programmers, while posting a comment. Even though the site has been dedicated to technical problem solving and debugging, hate speech as well as posting offensive comments make the community “toxic”. By identifying and minimising various patterns of norm violations in different SO communities, the community would become less toxic and thereby the community can engage more effectively in its goal of knowledge sharing. Moreover, through automatic detection of such comments, the authors can be warned by the moderators, so that it is less likely to be repeated, thereby the reputation of the site and community can be improved. Based on the comments extracted from two different data sources on SO, this work first presents a taxonomy of norms that are violated. Second, it demonstrates the sanctions for certain norm violations. Third, it proposes a recommendation system that can be used to warn users that they are about to violate a norm. This can help achieve norm adherence in online communities.},

abstract = {Software developers use Stack Overflow on a daily basis to search for solutions to problems they encounter during bug fixing and feature enhancement. In prior work, studies have been done on mining Stack Overflow data such as for predicting unanswered questions or how and why people post. However, no work exists on how developers actually use, or more importantly, read the information presented to them on Stack Overflow. To better understand this behavior, we conduct an eye tracking study on how developers seek for information on Stack Overflow while tasked with creating human-readable summaries of methods and classes in large Java projects. Eye gaze data is collected on both the source code elements and Stack Overflow document elements at a fine token-level granularity using iTrace, our eye tracking infrastructure. We found that developers look at the text more often than the title in posts. Code snippets were the second most looked at element. Tags and votes are rarely looked at. When switching between Stack Overflow and the Eclipse Integrated Development Environment (IDE), developers often looked at method signatures and then switched to code and text elements on Stack Overflow. Such heuristics provide insight to automated code summarization tools as they decide what to give more weight to while generating summaries.},

Answer etc. helps us to understand the programming concepts easily and quickly in a way that has been tested and applied by many software developers. Stack Overflow is one of the most frequently used programming Q&amp;A website where the questions and answers posted are presently analyzed manually, which requires a huge amount of time and resource. To save the effort, we present a topic modeling based technique to analyze the words of the original texts to discover the themes that run through them. We also propose a method to automate the process of reviewing the quality of questions on Stack Overflow dataset in order to avoid ballooning the stack overflow with insignificant questions. The proposed method also recommends the appropriate tags for the new post, which averts the creation of unnecessary tags on Stack Overflow.},

What remains unknown is whether this is due to a few people contributing a lot, or whether highly represented countries have a higher percentage of users who are willing to contribute. In this paper, we investigate this question with the goal of identifying opportunities to equalize contributions between countries. Analyzing the data from StackOverflow and Superuser, two popular Q&amp;A sites, we find that the percentage of contributing users significantly varies between 116 countries, and that these differences can be partly explained by a country's national culture and overall English proficiency. We discuss how specific design decisions on these sites, such as the competitive reward mechanism used to encourage contributions, could be changed to encourage currently passive people to contribute.},

abstract = {It is no secret that females engage less in programming fields than males. However, in online communities, such as Stack Overflow, this gender gap is even more extreme: only 5.8\% of contributors are female. In this paper, we use a mixed-methods approach to identify contribution barriers females face in online communities. Through 22 semi-structured interviews with a spectrum of female users ranging from non-contributors to a top 100 ranked user of all time, we identified 14 barriers preventing them from contributing to Stack Overflow. We then conducted a survey with 1470 female and male developers to confirm which barriers are gender related or general problems for everyone. Females ranked five barriers significantly higher than males. A few of these include doubts in the level of expertise needed to contribute, feeling overwhelmed when competing with a large number of users, and limited awareness of site features. Still, there were other barriers that equally impacted all Stack Overflow users or affected particular groups, such as industry programmers. Finally, we describe several implications that may encourage increased participation in the Stack Overflow community across genders and other demographics.},

However, given the limited time, attention, and memory capacity of programmers, navigating SO posts and comparing different solutions is time-consuming and cumbersome. Recent research has proposed to summarize SO posts to concise text to help programmers quickly assess the relevance and quality of SO posts. Yet there is no large dataset of high-quality SO post summaries, hindering the development and evaluation of post summarization techniques. We present SOSum, a dataset of 2,278 popular SO answer posts with manually labeled summative sentences. Questions in SOSum cover 669 tags with a median view count of 253K and a median post score of 17. This dataset will foster research on sentence-level summarization of SO posts and has the potential to facilitate text summarization research on other types of textual software artifacts such as programming tutorials.},

It counts more than two millions of users who actively contribute by asking and answering thousands of questions daily. Identifying and reviewing low quality posts preserves the quality of site's contents and it is crucial to maintain a good user experience. In Stack Overflow the identification of poor quality posts is performed by selected users manually. The system also uses an automated identification system based on textual features. Low quality posts automatically enter a review queue maintained by experienced users. We present an approach to improve the automated system in use at Stack Overflow. It analyzes both the content of a post (e.g., simple textual features and complex readability metrics) and community-related aspects (e.g., popularity of a user in the community). Our approach reduces the size of the review queue effectively and removes misclassified good quality posts.},

abstract = {Community question answering (CQA) services provide platforms for increasing number of users to seek for help and exchange ideas in recent years. As a professional community, Quora is quite different from other traditional CQA websites, such as Baidu Zhidao and Yahoo! Answers. As users' social statuses play a more important role, besides just raising questions and finding a proper answer which the asker is satisfied with, people are inclined to have more discussions about the question, corresponding answers and related topics. Due to the spirit of wiki, people, especially some leading users work hard together to make the community a knowledge base of high quality, which in turn attracts more people to take part in this job. Thus, in this study, we focus on detecting leading users within a specific topic area of professional CQA services. A leading capacity model is utilized and three major criteria, which are authority, activity and influence, are taken into consideration. Then, an improved Borda count model is proposed to make a collective decision. Experimental results show effectiveness of the proposed method for finding leading users.},

In light of these issues, we proposed a tri-modal deep boltzmann machine (tri-DBM) to extract unified representation for query, question and answer. Experiments on Yahoo!

abstract = {Technical questions and answers (Q&amp;A) websites accumulate a significant amount of knowledge from users. Developers are especially active on these Q&amp;A websites, since developers are constantly facing new development challenges that require help from other experts. Over the years, Q&amp;A website designers have derived several incentive systems (e.g., gamification) to encourage users to answer questions that are posted by others. However, the current incentive systems primarily focus on the quantity and quality of the answers instead of encouraging the rapid answering of questions. Improving the speed of getting an answer can significantly improve the user experience and increase user engagement on such Q&amp;A websites.In this paper [1], we study the factors for fast answers on such Q&amp;A websites. Our goal is to explore how one may improve the current incentive systems to motivate fast answering of questions. We use a logistic regression model to analyze 46 factors along four dimensions (i.e., question, asker, answer, and answerer dimension) in order to understand the relationship between the studied factors and the needed time to get an accepted answer. The question dimension calculates various textual and readability features of a question, as well as the popularity and difficulty of the question's tags. The asker dimension calculates the reputation of an asker and his/her historical tendency to get answers. The answer dimension computes textual features from the text of the accepted answer. The answerer dimension computes the historical activity level of the answerer who answered the question. We conduct our study on the four most popular (i.e., with the most questions) Q&amp;A Stack Exchange websites: Stack Overflow, Mathematics, Ask Ubuntu, and Superuser. We find that i) factors in the answerer dimension have the strongest effect on the needed time to get an accepted answer, after controlling for other factors; ii) the current incentive system does not recognize non-frequent answerers who often answer questions which frequent answerers are not able to answer well. Such questions that are answered by non-frequent answerers are as important as those that are answered by frequent answerers; iii) the current incentive system motivates frequent answerers well, but such frequent answerers tend to answer short questions.Our findings suggest that the designers of Q&amp;A website should improve their incentive systems to motivate non-frequent answerers to be more active and to answer questions faster, in order to shorten the waiting time for an answer (especially for questions that require specific knowledge that frequent answerers might not possess). In addition, the question answering incentive system needs to factor in the value and difficulty of answering the questions (e.g., by providing more rewards to harder questions or questions that remain unanswered for a long period of time).},

These expectations of benefits vary from tangible incentives provided by organizations to positive feelings aroused by altruistic behavior. The theory of consumption values (TCV) allows a specification of distinct types of benefits (functional, social, emotional, epistemic and conditional) which individuals consider before they decide to share knowledge. Furthermore, the perceived costs of sharing can reduce the perceived value of knowledge sharing. These costs are non-monetary sacrifices (effort and risks) reducing the perceived value of sharing. In this work we develop the perceived value of knowledge sharing as a multidimensional construct, grounded in assumptions of social exchange theory, consumer research and knowledge sharing literature. This conceptualization is intended to serve as a basis for the operationalization of perceived knowledge value in a future study on knowledge sharing intentions.},

abstract = {Community question answering (cQA), which provides a platform for people with diverse background to share information and knowledge, has become an increasingly popular research topic. In this paper, we focus on the task of question retrieval. The key problem of question retrieval is to measure the similarity between the queried questions and the historical questions which have been solved by other users. The traditional methods measure the similarity based on the bag-of-words (BOWs) representation. This representation neither captures dependencies between related words, nor handles synonyms or polysemous words. In this work, we first propose a way to build a concept thesaurus based on the semantic relations extracted from the world knowledge of Wikipedia. Then, we develop a unified framework to leverage these semantic relations in order to enhance the question similarity in the concept space. Experiments conducted on a real cQA data set show that with the help of Wikipedia thesaurus, the performance of question retrieval is improved as compared to the traditional methods.},

abstract = {Online knowledge sharing sites have recently exploded in popularity, and have began to play an important role in online information seeking. Unfortunately, many factors that influence the effectiveness of the information exchange in these communities are not well understood. This paper is an attempt to fill this gap by exploring the dynamics of information sharing in such sites - that is, identifying the factors that can explain how people respond to information requests. As a case study, we use Yahoo! Answers, one of the leading knowledge sharing portals on the web with millions of active participants. We follow the progress of thousands of questions, from posting until resolution. We examine contextual factors such as the topical area of the questions, as well as intrinsic factors of question wording, subjectivity, sentiment, and other characteristics that could influence how a community responds to an information request. Our findings could be useful for improving existing collaborative question answering systems, and for designing the next generation of knowledge sharing communities.},

abstract = {Development of products and services requires information on customer needs. In many cases there are several people interfacing with customers throughout the organization. Information can be highly shattered, unorganized and not codified. One of the key issues is that the people who are interacting with customers may be other than those who are involved with development of products and services. Here the challenge is to integrate information and knowledge from customer needs to the R&amp;D process.There are mechanisms for sharing information so that it can be effectively used in R&amp;D process. Knowledge sharing mechanisms become especially important in a large organization which operates in multiple locations. These call for infrastructures, rules and procedures. In this paper we study mechanisms that empower the sharing of knowledge and information between individuals, especially customer feedback is the focus of this research.},

abstract = {Ontology development is fundamental to most knowledge management efforts. When approached in a formal knowledge engineering manner the resulting ontology usually becomes brittle when spanning even a modest number of groups within a single organization. It breaks entirely when scaled to multiple, heterogeneous organizations. A promising alternative is the bottom-up approach such as can be found in social tagging systems (e.g., del.ico.us), but little research has examined the utility of these systems for knowledge reuse activities. In this paper we extend our field work with IT helpdesk staff to examine the drivers for natural ontology development. We found that a balance between some degree of external order while maintaining local flexibility was required. This information space is navigated via social relations, especially expert referral. We examine the user-centered design criteria for both mid-level ontology development and related expert profile management.},

We developed a questionnaire to support deeper understanding of user experiences with knowledge sharing activities. The results reveal that there are several challenging issues biologists encounter when using bioinformatics resources. A much smaller number of biologists have engaged in passive knowledge sharing within their research fields than we had expected. However, most biologists expressed their willingness to share their own knowledge with others. This result reinforces the need for more user-centered design approaches for supporting knowledge-sharing in rapidly emerging fields of data-intensive science. At the same time, our results suggest that more work is needed to examine how to best motivate users to further engage and contribute knowledge in online scientific communities.},

However, most of the previous studies have focused on investigating the direct impact of social capital, while the underlying mechanism by which social capital affects knowledge contribution has not been fully understood. It has been argued that social capital facilitates knowledge exchange by affecting the conditions necessary for exchange, not the exchange behavior itself. We developed a research model in which anticipated status enhancement and community identification were identified as two mediators between social capital and the willingness to contribute knowledge. PLS analyses based on data collected from 448 online community members show that the two mediators affect knowledge contribution positively. Except shared language, all other social capital factors, namely, instrumental network ties, expressive network ties, community trustworthiness, and norms of cooperation have significant positive effects on the mediators and their indirect effects on knowledge contribution are also significant.},

Specifically, we build the system in a modular manner where each modular construction is enriched with crowd knowledge from social sites. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that attempts to build intelligent multimodal conversational systems for travel, and moves an important step towards developing human-like assistants for completion of daily life tasks.

However, the centralized knowledge management systems may sometimes cause problems in sharing knowledge. One potential solution is to conduct KS in a decentralized network supported by peer-to-peer technology. While extensive research has been done to address the flaws of current reputation-based feedback mechanisms for promoting knowledge diffusion in peer-to-peer communities, some serious drawbacks of feedback mechanisms, namely dimensionality and interaction-dependency effects, have been overlooked. Using an agent-based simulation, this paper examines these effects while also considering characteristics of the community. Results of our simulation show interesting findings, for example, that negligence of knowledge dimensionality and interaction-dependency in designing reputation mechanisms has a major negative effect on community knowledge performance. Further, more complex knowledge adversely affects community-level diffusion outcomes whereas greater network density improves them.},

abstract = {Services, such as Stack Overflow, offer a web platform to programmers for discussing technical issues, in form of Question and Answers (Q&amp;A). Since Q&amp;A services store the discussions, the generated crowd knowledge can be accessed and consumed by a large audience for a long time. Nevertheless, Q&amp;A services are detached from the development environments used by programmers: Developers have to tap into this crowd knowledge through web browsers and cannot smoothly integrate it into their workflow. This situation hinders part of the benefits of Q&amp;A services. To better leverage the crowd knowledge of Q&amp;A services, we created Seahawk, an Eclipse plugin that supports an integrated and largely automated approach to assist programmers using Stack Overflow. Seahawk formulates queries automatically from the active context in the IDE, presents a ranked and interactive list of results, lets users import code samples in discussions through drag \&amp; drop and link Stack Overflow discussions and source code persistently as a support for team work.

However, the problem of locating and matching appropriate knowledge resources from across organisational boundaries to various tasks within specific e-Work projects remains a huge challenge. This often stems from lack of collective trust among virtual teams and the high value which organisations attach to knowledge as an asset of competitive advantage. In this paper, we present an approach for task-centred knowledge sharing in e-Collaboration. Our approach uses task-aware knowledge element models for locating and matching knowledge resources for specific e-Work tasks, and a work context tree for contextually determining the semantics of knowledge resources at different levels. We illustrate the approach using e-Workbench – a prototype adaptive collaborative e-Work support system based on the Knowledge Grid.},

We term this preferential selection as question selection bias and propose a mathematical model to estimate it. Our results show that using Gaussian classification models we can effectively distinguish experts from ordinary users over their selection biases. In order to estimate these biases, only a small amount of data per user is required, which makes an early identification of expertise a possibility. Further, our study of bias evolution reveals that they do not show significant changes over time indicating that they emanates from the intrinsic characteristics of users.},

Empirical analyses of 624 heath questions collected from Yahoo! Answers and WebMD reveal several important differences. In comparison, there were more questions about adverse drug reactions on WebMD, and more questions about seeking similar experiences on Yahoo! Answers.

abstract = {Although online learning environments are perceived to facilitate knowledge sharing among individuals, various empirical studies find that participants do not log on frequently or are reluctant to share ideas with others. It is thus crucial for educators to understand when and how online knowledge sharing occurs. Prior model framework has been adapted to explore the motivational factors that drive knowledge sharing among individuals in online learning environments, esp. if there are any gender differences of online knowledge sharing. The hypothesized relationships between the identified motivational factors and online knowledge sharing behavior are then tested using a survey questionnaire administered to a sample of 333 undergraduate students. The results indicate that perceived attachment motivation (the need to form) and perceived relationship commitment (the need to main a relationship) are important determinants of online knowledge sharing. Further analysis on gender differences reveals that male participants rated the need to form relationships more highly than their female counterparts. Implications to ensure online learning environments to encourage knowledge sharing behavior are discussed.},

abstract = {For a significant number of questions at Stack Overflow, none of the posted answers were accepted as solutions. Acceptance of an answer indicates that the answer actually solves the discussed problem in the question, and the question is answered sufficiently. In this paper, we investigate 3,956 such unresolved questions using an exploratory study where we analyze four important aspects of those questions, their answers and the corresponding users that partially explain the observed scenario. We then propose a prediction model by employing five metrics related to user behaviour, topics and popularity of question, which predicts if the best answer for a question at Stack Overflow might remain unaccepted or not. Experiments using 8,057 questions show that the model can predict unresolved questions with 78.70\% precision and 76.10\% recall.},

The new world of collaboration and communication has been created by online social networks. Hence, growth and popularity of social collaboration is continuously increasing day-by-day. In spite of the importance of social networks, there is comparatively little theory-driven empirical research that has been published to address this new type of communication and interaction phenomena. In this research, we explore the factors which motivate people to participate actively in social collaboration. We conceptualized that use of social collaboration is an intentional social action where people willing to share their knowledge, experience and expertise. We examine the relative impact of We-Intention, moral trust and self-motivation to participate in social collaboration and knowledge sharing activity. An empirical study of social collaborators has been done and we concluded that knowledge sharing is an important goal to participate in social collaboration.},

abstract = {Inter-team knowledge sharing is an important aspect of agile software development because it allows agility to be scaled to an entire organization. However, achieving inter-team knowledge sharing is not easy because the practices that allow it to happen are poorly reported In The literature. As a consequence, many Agile Software organizations find It difficult to share Experiences and best practices in their contexts, as well as improve employees' skills and expertise. Results from our previous qualitative Studies enabled us to generate A pattern language that aims to help agile Software organizations to adopt practices for fostering interaction among Agile teams in order to share knowledge Across teams and create collective knowledge. This paper contributes to the Agile Software development and knowledge management fields with practical guidance to organizations aiming those Improvements. "Because of space limitations, we describe only five patterns of the pattern language In This paper, which are briefly presented as follows. Open Workspace helps to stimulate face-to-face conversations across teams. Rotation of Teams' Members is a practice about transferring of professionals to other teams in order to spread technical, methodological and management solutions in a sustainable way. Pair Programming among Different Teams are specially adopted to level technical knowledge throughout the company. Collective Meetings foster inter-team communication and alignment about company's projects and goals. Finally, Technical Presentations Stimulate continuous learning and knowledge sharing behaviour. It is important to note that the adoption of the pattern language is affected by forces, such as organizational culture, environment, and top management and leadership support. These forces need to balanced to facilitate and/or reinforce the patterns.},

abstract = {IT services need an automatic and flexible ability to react to dynamic changes in their environment. Managing change effectively and reducing the negative effects of day-to-day operations has become one of the most important tasks in IT service management, which require hiring highly skilled IT professionals with correspondingly high labor costs. There is a challenge to select, implement and integrate the right resources quickly and effectively. Although there is a growing body of research into IT management, many techniques are either too narrow (focusing on a single component rather than the entire system), or they address only configuration data collection and integration. Instead, one needs to scale or respond to special domain knowledge, collaboration and the right data for helping IT professionals to improve their work. In this paper, we propose a knowledge-sharing based collaborating management system for IT service management. It aims to bridge the gap between domain experts’ knowledge and manageable systems. We developed a proof-of-concept of an impact analysis service based on knowledge-sharing; it establishes an IT service management collaboration paradigm and ecosystem, leveraging the expert’s rich knowledge and experience to improve the management quality and reduce the cost. A case study driven by customers demonstrates that collaboration with knowledge sharing is effective both at constructing useful system analysis services and in using those services to improve system management.},

year = {2015},
publisher = {IEEE Press},
abstract = {Stack Overflow is an enormously popular question-and-answer web site intended for software developers to help each other with programming issues. Some software projects aimed at developers (for example, application programming interfaces, application engines, cloud services, development frameworks, and the like) are closing their self-supported developer discussion forums and mailing lists and instead directing developers to use special-purpose tags on Stack Overflow. The goals of this paper are to document the main reasons given for moving developer support to Stack Overflow, and then to collect and analyze data from a group of software projects that have done this, in order to show whether the expected quality of support was actually achieved. The analysis shows that for all four software projects in this study, two of the desired quality indicators, developer participation and response time, did show improvements on Stack Overflow as compared to mailing lists and forums. However, we also found several projects that moved back from Stack Overflow, despite achieving these desired improvements. The results of this study are applicable to a wide variety of software projects that provide developer support using social media.},

Furthermore, the Suman system also recommends experts who can answer those questions. This helps to narrow down the long tail of unanswered questions. The Suman system utilises Semantic Web and Linked Data technologies to integrate the datasets from two websites, structure them and link them to Linked Data Cloud. It uses available tools to solve name entity disambiguation problem and expands the query term with added semantics. The Suman system was evaluated and results were analysed to show its viability.},

abstract = {Question recommendation that automatically recommends a new question to suitable users to answer is an appealing and challenging problem in the research area of Community Question Answering (CQA). Unlike in general recommender systems where a user has only a single role, each user in CQA can play two different roles (dual roles) simultaneously: as an asker and as an answerer. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first to systematically investigate the distinctions between the two roles and their different influences on the performance of question recommendation in CQA. Moreover, we propose a Dual Role Model (DRM) to model the dual roles of users effectively. With different indepen-dence assumptions, two variants of DRM are achieved. Finally, we present the DRM based approach to question recommendation which provides a mechanism for naturally integrating the user relation between the answerer and the asker with the content re-levance between the answerer and the question into a uni-fied probabilistic framework. Experiments using a real-world data crawled from Yahoo! Answers show that: (1) there are evident distinctions between the two roles of users in CQA. Additionally, the answerer role is more effective than the asker role for modeling candidate users in question recommendation; (2) compared with baselines utilizing a single role or blended roles based methods, our DRM based approach consistently and significantly improves the performance of question recommendation, demonstrating that our approach can model the user in CQA more reasonably and precisely.},

We focus on the hot and unresolved NFRs, the evolutions and trends of the NFRs in their discussions. We found that the most frequent topics the developers discuss are about usability and reliability while they concern few about maintainability and efficiency. The most unresolved problems also occurred in usability and reliability. Moreover, from the visualization of the NFR evolutions over time, we can find the trend for each NFR.},

In this paper, we seek to understand YA's knowledge sharing and activity. We analyze the forum categories and cluster them according to content characteristics and patterns of interaction among the users. While interactions in some categories resemble expertise sharing forums, others incorporate discussion, everyday advice, and support. With such a diversity of categories in which one can participate, we find that some users focus narrowly on specific topics, while others participate across categories. This not only allows us to map related categories, but to characterize the entropy of the users' interests. We find that lower entropy correlates with receiving higher answer ratings, but only for categories where factual expertise is primarily sought after. We combine both user attributes and answer characteristics to predict, within a given category, whether a particular answer will be chosen as the best answer by the asker.},

We then enhanced the performance of this classifier by using additional human assessments of question type as well as additional question features to first separate questions by type and then classify them. This two-step classifier improved the performance of the original classifier in identifying Type II errors and suggests that our model presents a novel approach for identifying bad questions with implications for query revision and routing.},

Knowledge sharing in online communities requires exerting time and effort and hence community members need motivation to contribute in these communities. Prior research identified numerous incentives that can motivate knowledge sharing in online communities such as self-efficacy and trust. However, research did not consider the effects of community types on the effectiveness of these incentives. In this paper we use meta-analysis to examine the effects of community type on knowledge sharing incentives in communities of interest and communities of practice. We examined 24 papers focusing on knowledge sharing incentives and we found that the type of online community moderates the effects of trust, commitment, task enjoyment and reciprocity on knowledge sharing. The outcome of this research demonstrates that future research should consider community types in knowledge sharing models.},

A large number of human workers on mobile terminals are used to carry out the tasks of image recognition, translation and quality assurance. Compared to purely technical solutions, this human computation approach is also able to account for context and non-textual cues, and provide higher level information to the end-user. In this paper, we describe a preliminary user study to create a model of end-user requirements.},

abstract = {To develop systems effectively, a shared system understanding is required. Collaborative modeling is one way to capture this shared understanding. Increasingly, in large systems engineering projects different distances lead to social barriers between stakeholders. These barriers affect the quantity and quality of knowledge that is shared between stakeholders, thus reducing the quality of the resulting product. While it has been proposed to limit modeling activities to co-located teams, this might not always be possible or feasible. We argue that, despite the technological advances in collaborative modeling, effective collaboration can only be achieved if we understand how to account for social barriers. We propose to study, in depth, how these barriers affect modeling, and how their effects can be reduced. By understanding the effects of social barriers and accounting for them, we can maximize the benefits of collaborative modeling.},

abstract = {Online question answering (Q&amp;A) forums like Stack Overflow have been playing an increasingly important role in supporting the daily tasks of developers. Stack Overflow can be considered as a meeting point of experienced developers and those who are looking for a solution for a specific problem. Since anyone with any background and experience level can ask and respond to questions, the community tries to use different solutions to maintain quality, such as closing and deleting inappropriate posts. As over 8,000 posts arrive on Stack Overflow every day, the effective automatic filtering of them is essential. In this paper, we present a novel approach for classifying questions based exclusively on their linguistic and semantic features using deep learning method. Our binary classifier relying on the textual properties of posts can predict whether the question is to be closed with an accuracy of 74\% similar to the results of previous metrics-based models. In accordance with our findings we conclude that by combining deep learning and natural language processing methods, the maintenance of quality at Q&amp;A forums could be supported using only the raw text of posts.},

The performance of knowledge sharing is fundamentally based on how collaborators and relevant knowledge can be effectively found. In this paper, we establish a peer-to-peer-based social network to facilitate and enhance Web-based knowledge sharing by finding knowledgeable and trustworthy collaborators who are willing to share their knowledge. Results of this research demonstrate that applying such mechanism do improve the quality of collaboration in knowledge sharing.},

We study the dialogues captured in the Software Configuration Management (SCM) tool used by a global SM organization and use Pajek, a Social Network Analysis (SNA) tool, to map the interactions among users and maintenance personnel. The results revealed technical, planning and domain information as most shared information. Network bottlenecks are also identified, which evolves around a key development manager, a development team leader and a systems analyst. Also, there are lack of direct interactions between programmers and domain knowledge providers. As such, the SM environment could benefit from process automations on selected tasks of the above bottleneck areas to ensure knowledge are shared across the board.},

This new resource has scarcely been acknowledged by any Integrated Development Environment (IDE): Even though developers spend a large part of their working time in IDEs, and the usage of Q&amp;A services has dramatically increased, developers can only use such resources using external applications.We introduce Seahawk, an Eclipse plugin to integrate Stack Overflow crowd knowledge in the IDE. It allows developers to seamlessly access Stack Overflow data, thus obtaining answers without switching the context. We present our preliminary work on Seahawk: It allows users to (1) retrieve Q&amp;A from Stack Overflow, (2) link relevant discussions to any source code in Eclipse, and (3) attach explanative comments to the links.},

A corollary is that myriad of questions and answers appear in CQA service. Accordingly, volumes of studies have been taken to explore the answer quality so as to provide a preliminary screening for better answers. However, to our knowledge, less attention has so far been paid to question quality in CQA. Knowing question quality provides us with finding and recommending good questions together with identifying bad ones which hinder the CQA service. In this paper, we are conducting two studies to investigate the question quality issue. The first study analyzes the factors of question quality and finds that the interaction between askers and topics results in the differences of question quality. Based on this finding, in the second study we propose a Mutual Reinforcement-based Label Propagation (MRLP) algorithm to predict question quality. We experiment with Yahoo!~Answers data and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm in distinguishing high-quality questions from low-quality ones.},

As the more knowledge people provided are shared in CQA, how to use the historical knowledge for solving new questions has become a crucial problem. In this paper, we investigate the problem as predicting best responders for new questions and tackle the problem from two perspectives, one is from the asker of the new question, and the other is from the question itself. We propose two supervised topic models, Asker-Responder Topic Model (ARTM) and Question-Responder Topic Model (QRTM) for both two perspectives by tracking people's answering history as background knowledge. Our experiments show that the two supervised topic models can effectively predict best responders for new questions in CQA without any additional works and have significant improvement over the baseline method.},

P2P aims at making the communication ubiquitous thereby crossing the communication boundary and has many attractive features to use it as a platform for collaborative multi-robot environments. We have implemented a P2P system based on JXTA Overlay. In this paper, we use JXTA Overlay as a platform for robot collaboration and knowledge sharing. We evaluated the knowledge sharing system by many experiments. Experimental results have shown that the proposed system has a good performance and can be used successfully for knowledge sharing between robots.},

abstract = {This paper details the design, implementation and evaluation of an ontology-based knowledge sharing tool. The system, "Squidz", automatically classifies browsed web pages against an ontology, and allows users to share comments made about those pages to members of a community. As the user browses web pages, recommendations of relevant documents which have already been shared are produced, based upon both the user's social network as well as the semantic content of the page currently in view. Key to the design of the system has been the requirement, evidenced by earlier studies, that sharing should be easily effected as a side-effect of browsing rather than comprising a separate and distracting task. Another feature of the system is the linkage of a formal ontology with user-provided tags of shared information, thus combining the proven popularity of folksonomy-based systems with the shared and formal domain model provided by an ontology.},

However, since the E-health subject is a multi-disciplinary and cross-organizational area, to have shared concepts, vocabulary plus a specification of its intended meaning, namely an ontology, has been an obstacle to develop e-health system. We will in this paper propose a knowledge sharing ontology on the basis of Activity Theory. We believe that Activity Theory can provide high level and rich ontology for the developers of E-health system to encompass the multi-disciplinary and cross-organizational knowledge. We validate our approach in the end by demonstrating our project IMIS (Integrated Mobile Information System for Healthcare) that uses the activity theory as ontological architecture for the construction of the whole system.},

The case of knowledge sharing between two member enterprises without participant of hegemony enterprise has been discussed using Prisoner Dilemma Game Model. There are many factors may affect the strategy of member enterprise like utility of monopolizing the knowledge, the lost monopolizing benefit when sharing the knowledge and the cost of the knowledge sharing. The theory of complete and perfect two-stage dynamic game of knowledge sharing based on work competition model has been applied to the analysis on knowledge sharing in virtual enterprise. The member enterprise will choose knowledge sharing level to make marginal income equal to the value of negative utility by sharing its knowledge at Nash Equilibrium. The hegemony enterprise should formulate a reasonable stimulation policy and give enough bounty to the member enterprise who has contributed more knowledge to the virtual enterprise through knowledge sharing. There is a positive correlation between stimulation level and the variance of random item probability distribution of production function.},

Next, we discuss our experiences on how architectural knowledge is shared in a large software development organization. Based on these experiences we propose a set of prerequisites that need to be met to foster successful architectural knowledge sharing. The importance of these prerequisites is motivated by demonstrating that they create the identified incentives.},

abstract = {Project-specific bugs are related to the misunderstanding or incomplete implementation of functional requirements. API-usage-related bugs are independent of the functional requirements. Usually they cause an unexpected and wrong output or behavior because of an incorrect usage of an API (Application Programming Interface). We propose an approach to find fixes for API-usage-related bugs, which is based on matching snippets being debugged against related snippets in a Q&amp;A website (Stack Overflow). We analyzed real code excerpts from OHLOH Code Search containing API method calls that may lead to API-usage-related bugs depending on how they are used by developers. We conducted a study with these excerpts to verify to what extent the proposed approach provides proper information from Stack Overflow to fix these potential API-usage-related bugs. The results are encouraging: 66.67\% of Java excerpts with potential API-usage-related bugs had their fixes found in the top-10 query results. Considering JavaScript excerpts, fixes were found in the top-10 results for 40\% of them. These results indicate that our approaches (i.e., lsab-java and lsab-js combined with the keyword filter) outperform Google and Stack Overflow in searching for API-usage-related bug fixes.},

abstract = {Community Question Answering (CQA) has emerged as a popular forum for users to ask and answer questions. Over the last few years, CQA portals such as Yahoo answersand Baidu Zhidao have exploded in popularity, and now provide a viable alternative to general purpose Web search. A number of answers submitted to address questions on CQA sites compose a valuable knowledge repository, which could be a gold mine for information retrieval as well as text mining. Two important questions in CQA research are focused on the quality of contents and the reputation of the answerers. Previous approaches for retrieving relevant and high quality content have been proposed, but not much work has been done on providing an integrated framework to solve these two problems. Besides, no research work has used both text and link information in their methods via leveraging existing ratings of answers and questions. In this paper, we present a novel approach to analyze questions and answers based on the topic modeling framework with Dirichlet forest priors (LDA-DF)[8]. We utilize information obtained from LDA-DF to construct a joint topical and link model to identify authorities and reliable answers on a CQA site.We evaluate our methods in a dataset obtained from Yahoo! Answers. With the new representation of topical structures on CQA datasets, using a limited amount of web resource, we show significant improvements over the state-of-art methods LDA-DF, LDA, and HLDA on performance of authority identification and answer ranking.},

Based on a preliminary conceptual model, this paper examines influencing factors, such as organizational strategy, and communication flow and channels, regarding inter-team knowledge sharing (KS) effectiveness in agile environments. We analyze the characteristics and the influence of the mentioned factors through a survey research method. Data was gathered from seven Brazilian agile software organizations. We employed statistical analysis techniques, e.g., structural equation modeling and cross-table analysis, to analyze the results. Within the surveyed companies, organizational strategy reflects on moderate commitment towards knowledge. KS practices are carried out to an acceptable standard. Extensive communication flow and the use of several channels denote that agile companies are also fostering interaction across teams. We found strong relationship between these factors and the companies' experience on agile methods. As companies continue on an agile adoption program, they growingly focus on long-term goals and consider knowledge as strategic resource. However, they still need to improve strategy alignment to all organization levels. Thus, we recommend that agile companies consider these factors when striving on this endeavor.},

The attributes were extracted from a textual analysis of the title and body of each question. We considered a total of 8 attributes to get the data for each question.

In a classification task with limited resources, Active Learning (AL) promises to guide annotators to examples that bring the most value for a classifier. AL can be successfully combined with self-training, i.e., extending a training set with the unlabelled examples for which a classifier is the most certain. We report our experiences on using AL in a systematic manner to train an SVM classifier for Stack Overflow posts discussing performance of software components. We show that the training examples deemed as the most valuable to the classifier are also the most difficult for humans to annotate. Despite carefully evolved annotation criteria, we report low inter-rater agreement, but we also propose mitigation strategies. Finally, based on one annotator's work, we show that self-training can improve the classification accuracy. We conclude the paper by discussing implication for future text miners aspiring to use AL and self-training.},

abstract = {Social media have become very popular. The number of social media users, and the number of interactions among them, is huge. The social media environment plays host to a range of activities, including the exchange of photos and video media, the exchange of ideas and comments, and the building of personal and career networks. Accordingly, the social media environment also serves as a useful supplement to informal learning outside the classroom for both full-time students and adult learners. It is thus crucial that educators understand the determinants of online knowledge sharing. In this study, an existing model framework is adapted to explore the motivational factors that drive knowledge sharing among individuals in the social media environment, particularly to determine whether there are any attachment style differences in online knowledge sharing. The hypothesized relationships between the motivational factors identified and online knowledge sharing behavior are then tested using a survey questionnaire administered to 3,590 post-secondary students applying to a local university. The results indicate that perceived attachment motivation (the need to form a relationship) and perceived relationship commitment (the need to maintain a relationship) are important determinants of online knowledge sharing. Further analysis of attachment styles reveals that high attachment-style individuals rate the need to form relationships more highly than their low attachment-style counterparts. However, the results are the reverse for the need to maintain a relationship. The implications for the encouragement of knowledge sharing behavior in the social media environment are discussed.},

Presently, there is a research gap that examines what factors promote such barriers and their direct impact on knowledge seeking and knowledge contributing behaviors via information and communication technologies (ICTs). To bridge the gap, a content analysis study of 104 KM articles identified three contributors to common KM barriers. A proposed causal model based on the contributors was tested using structural equation modeling technique on the responses collected from 314 ICT users. The results demonstrate that role conflict, role ambiguity, and locus of control predicted knowledge seeking and knowledge contributing behaviors via ICTs.},

abstract = {Due to lack of resources (funds, social influence, user feedback etc.), small companies, in particular, start-up companies, almost exclusively must rely on their own expertise with regards to technological innovation. Therefore, it could be beneficial for them to analyze big companies or competitors' products in order to get a better understanding of what users think about them. The core idea of my research project is to use opinions voiced by users about strengths and weaknesses of competitors' products to improve the understanding of actual user needs and thus help focus the requirements definition of the small, especially start-up company's own product. In order to lower the cost of analysis, we investigate how user needs can be distilled from online open sources. Since there are different types of online open sources, as a starting point of our current stage of research, we focused on one type of online open sources - question and answer (Q&amp;A) sites such as Stack Overflow. As a showcase, we used the IDE project Eclipse. In our exploratory study, we analyzed the popularity of Eclipse, the amount of questions asked, the amount of questions asked that received an accepted answer, as well as the contents of questions asked about Eclipse. We also analyzed the emotional polarity of the posted questions. We found that the Stack Overflow timely updates, and the emotions reflected is more objective according to the result shown by sentiment analysis that 82\% questions show neutral emotion.},

abstract = {API design is known to be a challenging craft, as API designers must balance their elegant ideals against "real-world" concerns, such as utility, performance, backwards compatibility, and unforeseen emergent uses. However, to date, there is no principled method to collect or analyze API usability information that incorporates input from typical developers. In practice, developers often turn to Q&amp;A websites such as stackoverflow.com (SO) when seeking expert advice on API use; the popularity of such sites has thus led to a very large volume of unstructured information that can be searched with diligence for answers to specific questions. The collected wisdom within such sites could, in principle, be of great help to API designers to better support developer needs, if only it could be collected, analyzed, and distilled for practical use.In this paper, we present a methodology that combines several techniques, including social network analysis and topic mining, to recommend SO posts that are likely to concern API design-related issues. To establish a comparison baseline, we introduce two more recommendation approaches: a reputation-based recommender and a random recommender. We have found that when applied to Q&amp;A discussion of two popular mobile platforms, Android and iOS, our methodology achieves up to 93\% accuracy and is more stable with its recommendations when compared to the two baseline techniques.},

abstract = {Community-based Question and Answering (CQA) services have brought users to a new era of knowledge dissemination by allowing users to ask questions and to answer other users' questions. However, due to the fast increasing of posted questions and the lack of an effective way to find interesting questions, there is a serious gap between posted questions and potential answerers. This gap may degrade a CQA service's performance as well as reduce users' loyalty to the system. To bridge the gap, we present a new approach to Question Routing, which aims at routing questions to participants who are likely to provide answers. We consider the problem of question routing as a classification task, and develop a variety of local and global features which capture different aspects of questions, users, and their relations. Our experimental results obtained from an evaluation over the Yahoo!~Answers dataset demonstrate high feasibility of question routing. We also perform a systematical comparison on how different types of features contribute to the final results and show that question-user relationship features play a key role in improving the overall performance.},

abstract = {Reliability issues arise in Peer-to-Peer Semantic Knowledge Sharing (P2PSKS) systems. P2PSKS systems are prone to disconnection failures. Disconnection failures deprive the network peers from having access to complete knowledge in the PSPSKS system. Disconnection failures arise when the P2PSKS systems employ the adaptive query routing methods in order to avoid flooding the networks with redundant search messages or queries during information exchange. P2PSKS systems need to utilize fault-tolerant query result evaluation function in order to be reliable. The current publication will focus on two objectives in P2PSKS research: 1. reliability problem identification and 2. reliability problem solutions. The P2PSKS system reliability problem will be identified through the use of simulation modeling techniques. The P2PSKS system reliability problem solutions will be advanced through adaptations of the generous tit-for-tat method which was originally developed in evolutionary game theory. The current research will demonstrate more reliable solutions to address P2PSKS system reliability issues by advancing the Fault-Tolerant Adaptive Query Routing (FTAQR) algorithm.},

abstract = {Developers often search for relevant code examples on the web for their programming tasks. Unfortunately, they face two major problems. First, the search is impaired due to a lexical gap between their query (task description) and the information associated with the solution. Second, the retrieved solution may not be comprehensive, i.e., the code segment might miss a succinct explanation. These problems make the developers browse dozens of documents in order to synthesize an appropriate solution. To address these two problems, we propose CROKAGE (Crowd Knowledge Answer Generator), a tool that takes the description of a programming task (the query) and provides a comprehensive solution for the task. Our solutions contain not only relevant code examples but also their succinct explanations. Our proposed approach expands the task description with relevant API classes from Stack Overflow Q \&amp; A threads and then mitigates the lexical gap problems. Furthermore, we perform natural language processing on the top quality answers and then return such programming solutions containing code examples and code explanations unlike earlier studies. We evaluate our approach using 97 programming queries, of which 50\% was used for training and 50\% was used for testing, and show that it outperforms six baselines including the state-of-art by a statistically significant margin. Furthermore, our evaluation with 29 developers using 24 tasks (queries) confirms the superiority of CROKAGE over the state-of-art tool in terms of relevance of the suggested code examples, benefit of the code explanations and the overall solution quality (code + explanation).},

abstract = {As online community question answering (cQA) portals like Yahoo! Answers1 and Baidu Zhidao2 have attracted over hundreds of millions of questions, how to utilize these questions and accordant answers becomes increasingly important for cQA websites. Prior approaches focus on using information retrieval techniques to provide a ranked list of questions based on their similarities to the query. Due to the high variance of question quality and answer quality, users have to spend lots of time on finding the truly best answers from retrieved results. In this paper, we develop an answer retrieval and summarization system which directly provides an accurate and comprehensive answer summary instead of a list of similar questions to user’s query. To fully explore the information of relations between queries and questions, between questions and answers, and between answers and sentences, we propose a new probabilistic scoring model to distinguish high-quality answers from low-quality answers. By fully exploiting these relations, we summarize answers using a maximum coverage model. Experiment results on the data extracted from Chinese cQA websites demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed method.},

abstract = {All askers who post questions in Community-based Question Answering (CQA) sites such as Yahoo! Answers, Quora or Baidu's Zhidao, expect to receive an answer, and are frustrated when their questions remain unanswered. We propose to provide a type of "heads up" to askers by predicting how many answers, if at all, they will get. Giving a preemptive warning to the asker at posting time should reduce the frustration effect and hopefully allow askers to rephrase their questions if needed. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to predict the actual number of answers, in addition to predicting whether the question will be answered or not. To this effect, we introduce a new prediction model, specifically tailored to hierarchically structured CQA sites.We conducted extensive experiments on a large corpus comprising 1 year of answering activity on Yahoo! Answers, as opposed to a single day in previous studies. These experiments show that the F1 we achieved is 24\% better than in previous work, mostly due the structure built into the novel model.},

We describe a similarity scheme for these elements and demonstrate how structural information can be extracted from source code snippets and compared to further improve the retrieval of questions. The results of our evaluation indicate that our methodology is effective on recommending similar question posts allowing community members to search without fully forming a question.},

abstract = {It is not a trivial problem to collect API-relevant examples, usages, and mentions on venues such as Stack Overflow. It requires efforts to correctly recognize whether the discussion refers to the API method that developers/tools are searching for. The content of the Stack Overflow thread, which consists of both text paragraphs describing the involvement of the API method in the discussion and the code snippets containing the API invocation, may refer to the given API method. Leveraging this observation, we develop ARSeek, a context-specific algorithm to capture the semantic and syntactic information of the paragraphs and code snippets in a discussion. ARSeek combines a syntactic word-based score with a score from a predictive model fine-tuned from CodeBERT. In terms of F1-score, ARSeek achieves an average score of 0.8709 and beats the state-of-the-art approach by 14\%.},

abstract = {Knowledge management plays an important role in the software architecting process. Recently, this role has become more apparent by a paradigm shift that views a software architecture as the set of architectural design decisions it embodies. This shift has sparked the discussion in both research and practice on how to best facilitate sharing of so-called architectural knowledge, and how tools can best be employed. In order to design successful tool support for architectural knowledge sharing it is important to take into account what software architecting really entails. To this end, in this paper we define the main characteristics of architecting, based on observations in a large software development organization, and state-of-the-art literature in software architecture. Based on the defined characteristics, we determine how best practices known from knowledge management could be used to improve architectural knowledge sharing. This results in the definition of a set of desired properties of architectural knowledge sharing tools. To improve the status quo of architectural knowledge sharing tools, we present the design of an architectural knowledge sharing platform.},

The two main trees are delegated to solving two different visual tasks and are allowed to share knowledge with each other by calling the remaining GP trees (subfunctions) included in the same individual. The method is applied to the visual learning task of recognizing simple shapes, using generative approach based on visual primitives. We compare this approach to a reference method devoid of knowledge sharing, and conclude that in the worst case cross-task learning performs equally well, and in many cases it leads to significant performance improvements in one or both solved tasks.},

abstract = {Automatic Subjective Question Answering (ASQA), which aims at answering users' subjective questions using summaries of multiple opinions, becomes increasingly important. One challenge of ASQA is that expected answers for subjective questions may not readily exist in the Web. The rising and popularity of Community Question Answering (CQA) sites, which provide platforms for people to post and answer questions, provides an alternative to ASQA. One important task of ASQA is question subjectivity identification, which identifies whether a user is asking a subjective question. Unfortunately, there has been little labeled training data available for this task. In this paper, we propose an approach to collect training data automatically by utilizing social signals in CQA sites without involving any manual labeling. Experimental results show that our data-driven approach achieves 9:37\% relative improvement over the supervised approach using manually labeled data, and achieves 5:15\% relative gain over a state-of-the-art semi-supervised approach. In addition, we propose several heuristic features for question subjectivity identification. By adding these features, we achieve 11:23\% relative improvement over word n-gram feature under the same experimental setting.},

We focus on the sharing of data associated with events of interest to collaborating organizations. Condition-action-alternative-action rules, logic/derivation rules, and constraint rules are used to define organizational and inter-organizational policies, regulations, and data and security constraints. Structures of these heterogeneous rules are used to capture organizational and inter-organizational processes and operating procedures.

abstract = {A goal of user assisting agents is to provide effective assistance to their users in their tasks. The problem becomes challenging when the users are involved in a cognitive activity such as a knowledge gathering task through the web, and when the agents cannot clearly know the task of their users in advance. The challenge grows when the agent themselves do not possess the knowledge required for such tasks. It is in this scenario that we propose a socio-contextual model of knowledge sharing within a community of user assisting agents, provided through the environment of an open domain knowledge portal, which are used by the users for their web based knowledge gathering tasks. The agents involve themselves in a knowledge sharing exercise by implementing the socio-contextual model that may allow each agent to gain knowledge about a task of their interest from other fellow agents through which they can assist their respective users. We evaluate our model through an experiment involving many knowledge gathering tasks from diverse domains and the results indicate interesting implications of the model with respect to the agents, their tasks and their community.},

Prior studies have shown low participation of women programmers on Stack Overflow, but have not demonstrated how the presence of their peers may promote activity. In this work, we understand how the presence of women, through peer parity, can encourage women to participate more on Stack Overflow. We extracted 3,2209,817 posts from the most recent Stack Overflow data dump. By modifying a popular gender computing tool, we took the first names of online users and identified the gender of 2,502,438 users from the 5,987,284 list of current users. We randomly selected peer parity and non peer parity questions asked by women and identify differences in participation on those posts. We found that women become more active after they have taken part in a peer parity post. With further analysis of peer parity through eye tracking and tone detection tools we can determine ways to foster a more welcoming community that would encourage women to participate.},

abstract = {Over the past few years, online communities have gained their popularity among internet users. Many people join these communities to share experiences and ask for advices [1]. Since “sharing one’s original experience is the fundamental source of tacit knowledge” [2, p.670], it is possible that online community users from all over the world are sharing their tacit knowledge while they are revealing their personal experiences and advices in their discussion threads. Moreover, since many online communities allow their users to embed images within their messages, it is interesting to find out how people use images to share tacit knowledge online. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to investigate the image usage and tacit knowledge sharing in online communities. The research method used in this study was content analysis. The findings suggest that online community users embed digital images in their messages to aid their tacit knowledge sharing.},

Awaaz.De features a configurable mobile voice application organized into asynchronous voice mes-sage boards. For poor, remote and marginal communities, the voice-touchtone interface addresses the constraints of low literacy, language diversity, and affordability of only basic mobile devices. Voice content also presents a low barrier to content authoring, encouraging otherwise disconnected communities to actively participate in knowledge exchange. Awaaz.De includes a web-based administration interface for Internet-connected community managers to moderate, annotate, categorize, route, and narrow-cast voice messages. In this paper we describe the platform's design, implementation, and future directions.},

In order to rank the answerers, we propose a framework called Question Routing (QR) which consists of four phases: (1) performance profiling, (2) expertise estimation, (3) availability estimation, and (4) answerer ranking. Applying the framework, we conduct experiments with Yahoo!

In order to discover what architectural knowledge needs architects have, we conducted a study in a large organization. In this study we discovered that architects are especially in need for `Just-In-Time architectural knowledge'. To fulfill this need we designed and implemented an architectural knowledge sharing portal. Our portal's integrated functionality supports architects in their decision-making process, by providing easy access to the right architectural knowledge at any given point in time.},

abstract = {Conventionally, callbacks and inversion of control have been the main tools to structure event-driven applications. Sadly, those patterns constitute a well-known source of design problems. The Reactive Programming (RP) paradigm has arisen as an approach to mitigate these problems. Yet, little evidence has been provided regarding the advantages of RP, and concerns have also arisen about the API usability of RP libraries given their disparate number of operators. In this work, we conduct a study on GitHub (GH) and Stack Overflow (SO) and explore three Reactive Extensions (Rx) libraries (RxJava, RxJS, and RxSwift) with the most GH projects to understand how much the vast Rx operators are being used. Also, we examine Rx SO posts to complement the results from the GH exploration by understanding the problems faced by RP developers and how they relate with the operators' frequencies found in open source projects. Results reveal that, in spite of its API size, the great majority of the Rx operators are actually being used (95.2\%), with only a few, mostly related to RxJava, not being utilized. Also, we unveil 23 topics from SO with more posts concerning the Stream Abstraction (36.4\%). Posts related to Dependency Management, Introductory Questions, and iOS Development figure as relevant topics to the community. The findings herein present can not only stimulate advancements in the field by understanding the usage of RP API and the main problems faced by developers, but also help newcomers in identifying the most important operators and the areas that are the most likely to be relevant for a RP application.},

In this paper, a cause-effect model is established to analyze the relationship between corporation social responsibility and efficiency of knowledge sharing by middle variables (i.e. corporate leadership and reputation). And then, Based on social network, a threshold model is constructed to explore how the corporate social responsibility affects the efficiency of knowledge sharing. The simulation results confirm that the corporate social responsibility will indirectly affect the knowledge sharing efficiency through corporate leadership and reputation. There is a significant positive correlation between them. This provides a new perspective to study the non-technical factors which lead to dilemma of knowledge sharing. Surely, it will be helpful for us to deeply understand how the corporate social responsibility impacts the corporate performance.},

abstract = {Knowledge is a critical property that organizations use to gain and maintain competitive advantages. In the constantly changing business environment, organizations have to exploit effective and efficient approaches to help knowledge workers find task-relevant knowledge, as well as to preserve, share and reuse such knowledge. Hence, an important issue is how to discover knowledge flow (KF) from the historical work records of knowledge workers in order to understand their task-needs and the ways they reference documents, and actively provide adaptive knowledge support. This work proposes a KF-based document recommendation method that integrates KF mining and collaborative filtering recommendation mechanisms to recommend codified knowledge. The approach consists of two phases: the KF mining phase and the recommendation phase. The KF mining phase can identify each worker’s knowledge flow by considering the referencing time and citation relations of knowledge resources. Then, based on the discovered KF, the recommendation phase applies sequential rule mining and the CF method to recommend relevant documents to the target worker. Experiments are conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed method and compare it with the traditional CF method using data collected from a research institute laboratory. The experiment results show that the proposed method can improve the quality of recommendation.},

Improved mechanisms for interpreting the terms used to describe knowledge across system boundaries are proposed and tested. The method is also capable of handling complex product designs and realistic manufacturing scenarios involving several parties. This is achieved using an agent-architecture to simulate the effects of individual manufacturing facilities (e.g. machine tools and foundries) on product features. It is hypothesised that knowledge sharing between such agents can be enhanced by integrating common product and manufacturing information models with a shared ontology, and that the shared ontology can be based largely on The Process Specification Language (PSL).},

However, it is difficult to determine which APIs are discussed in those code snippets because they often suffer from declaration ambiguities and missing external references. In this paper, we introduce COSTER, a context-sensitive type solver that can determine the fully qualified names (FQNs) of API elements in those code snippets. The tool uses three different similarity measures to rank potential FQNs of a query API element. Results from our quantitative evaluation and user study demonstrate that the proposed tool can not only recommend FQNs of API elements with great accuracy but can also help developers to reuse online code snippets by suggesting the required import statements.Website: https://khaledkucse.github.io/COSTER/Demo Video: https://youtu.be/oDZtw9MzUWM},

However, with the increasing reliance on online knowledge sharing technologies, there is also an increasing danger that knowledge objects stored in digital forms are subjected to concerted malicious and possible criminal attacks. Digital knowledge objects can become easy prey to tampering and modifications which may defeat the original intent for knowledge sharing as well as causing loss of confidence among users. The preservation of the integrity of digital knowledge objects becomes increasingly important now than ever and the need has come for technologies to safeguard the authenticity and integrity of such objects. This paper proposes a model to incorporate automated detection and recovery mechanisms for tampered knowledge objects to make sure that knowledge-processing resources continue to perform correct processing operations at all times.},

Computer-based survey is a better way to gather relationship data than traditional paper-and-pencil survey. Although it has limitations, it has the advantages over other methods such as easy anchoring, high adaptivity, Good Security, convenient networking. Then this paper takes an 8-person team as an example. The design of computer-base survey system ensures that each member of the team can evaluate his/her knowledge sharing behavior with every specific person.

abstract = {The increasing variety of programming languages available to computer programmers has led to the discussion of what language(s) should be learned. A key point in the choice of a programming language is the availability of support from experienced programmers. In this paper, we explore the use of graph theory in recommending programming languages to novice and expert programmers in a question and answer collaborative learning environment, Stack Overflow. Using social network analysis techniques, we investigate the relationship between experts (using an expertise graph) in different programming languages to identify what languages can be recommended to novice and experienced programmers. In addition, we explore the use of the expertise graph in inferring the importance of a programming language to the community. Our results suggest that programming languages can be recommended within organizational borders and programming domains. In addition, a high number of experts in a programming language does not always mean that the language is popular. Furthermore, disconnected nodes in the expertise graph suggest that experts in some programming languages are primarily on Stack Overflow to support that language only and do not contribute to questions or answers in other languages. Finally, developers are comfortable with mastering a single, general purpose language. The results of our study can help educators and stakeholders in computer education to understand what programming languages can be suggested to students and what languages can be taught and learned together.},

abstract = {Question answering communities such as Naver and Yahoo! Answers have emerged as popular, and often effective, means of information seeking on the web. By posting questions for other participants to answer, information seekers can obtain specific answers to their questions. Users of popular portals such as Yahoo! Answers already have submitted millions of questions and received hundreds of millions of answers from other participants. However, it may also take hours --and sometime days-- until a satisfactory answer is posted. In this paper we introduce the problem of predicting information seeker satisfaction in collaborative question answering communities, where we attempt to predict whether a question author will be satisfied with the answers submitted by the community participants. We present a general prediction model, and develop a variety of content, structure, and community-focused features for this task. Our experimental results, obtained from a largescale evaluation over thousands of real questions and user ratings, demonstrate the feasibility of modeling and predicting asker satisfaction.

abstract = {Community question answering (CQA) has become a very popular web service to provide a platform for people to share knowledge. In current CQA services, askers post their questions to the system and wait for answerers to answer them passively. This procedure leads to several drawbacks. Since new questions are presented to all users in the system, the askers can not expect some experts to answer their questions. Meanwhile, answerers have to visit many questions and then pick out only a small part of them to answer. To overcome those drawbacks, a probabilistic framework is proposed to predict best answerers for new questions. By tracking answerers' answering history, interests of answerers are modeled with the mixture of the Language Model and the Latent Dirichlet Allocation model. User activity and authority information is also taken into consideration. Experimental results show the proposed method can effectively push new questions to the best answerers.},

abstract = {Stack Overflow is often viewed as one of the most influential Software Question \&amp; Answer (SQA) websites, containing millions of programming-related questions and answers. Tags play a critical role in efficiently structuring the contents in Stack Overflow and are vital to support a range of site operations, e.g., querying relevant contents. Poorly selected tags often introduce extra noise and redundancy, which raises problems like tag synonym and tag explosion. Thus, an automated tag recommendation technique that can accurately recommend high-quality tags is desired to alleviate the problems mentioned above.Inspired by the recent success of pre-trained language models (PTMs) in natural language processing (NLP), we present PTM4Tag, a tag recommendation framework for Stack Overflow posts that utilize PTMs with a triplet architecture, which models the components of a post, i.e., Title, Description, and Code with independent language models. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that leverages PTMs in the tag recommendation task of SQA sites. We comparatively evaluate the performance of PTM4Tag based on five popular pre-trained models: BERT, RoBERTa, ALBERT, CodeBERT, and BERTOverflow. Our results show that leveraging CodeBERT, a software engineering (SE) domain-specific PTM in PTM4Tag achieves the best performance among the five considered PTMs and outperforms the state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Network-based approach by a large margin in terms of average Precision@k, Recall@k, and F1-score@k. We conduct an ablation study to quantify the contribution of a post's constituent components (Title, Description, and Code Snippets) to the performance of PTM4Tag. Our results show that Title is the most important in predicting the most relevant tags, and utilizing all the components achieves the best performance.},

abstract = {Answers submitted to CQA forums are often elaborate, contain spam, are marred by slurs and business promotions. It is difficult for a reader to go through numerous such answers to gauge community opinion. As a result summarization becomes a prioritized task. However, there is a dearth of neural approaches for CQA summarization due to the lack of large scale annotated dataset. We create CQASUMM, the first annotated CQA summarization dataset by filtering the 4.4 million Yahoo! Answers L6 dataset. We sample threads where the best answer can double up as a reference and build hundred word summaries from them. We provide scripts1 to reconstruct the dataset and introduce the new task of Community Question Answering Summarization.Multi document summarization(MDS) has been widely studied using news corpora. However documents in CQA have higher variance and contradicting opinion. We compare the popular MDS techniques and evaluate their performance on our CQA corpora. We find that most MDS workflows are built for the entirely factual news corpora, whereas our corpus has a fair share of opinion based instances too. We therefore introduce OpinioSumm, a new MDS which outperforms the best baseline by 4.6\% w.r.t ROUGE-1 score.},

In the Philippines, the Cordillera Administrative Region alone produces 83\% of the country's major agricultural crops.Farmers directly play significant role in maintaining the agri-based economy thus access to knowledge products (KP) generated and shared by experts is critical input to their farming practices. Most farmers reside in remote areas with poor internet access moreover, they are not techno-savvy; Short Messaging Service (SMS) still remains as popular ICT tool for information access due to its remote coverage, practicality, affordability, accessibility and popularity. Today, SMS-based applications are on the rise. They could be developed according to needs or can be availed as paid or free web-based platforms.This study described the extent on how farmers use text messaging in information gathering and sharing. Enhancement of the traditional SMS service using new technologies is deemed proper to productively mediate knowledge consumers and knowledge producers.This research aims to develop an SMS system based on the a) 6 levels of SMS-based e-government services b) SMS technology features identified by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), and c) government SMS based regulations and guidelines. The system will be evaluated by the farmers in terms of its perceived usability using the Factors influencing citizen adoption of SMS-based e-government services.The result of this research shall serve as an implementation guide for government, NGOs, extension service providers, system integrators, researchers, and other related groups offering or planning to engage in similar service.},

abstract = {While many tutorials, code examples, and documentation about Android APIs exist, developers still face various problems with the implementation of Android Apps. Many of these issues are discussed on Q&amp;A-sites, such as Stack Overflow. In this paper we present a manual categorization of 450 Android related posts of Stack Overflow concerning their question and problem types. The idea is to find dependencies between certain problems and question types to get better insights into issues of Android App development. The categorization is developed using card sorting with three experienced Android App developers. An initial approach to automate the classification of Stack Overflow posts using Lucene is also presented. The study highlights that the most common question types are 'How to…?' and 'What is the problem…?'. The problems that are discussed most often are related to 'User Interface' and 'Core Elements'. In particular, the problem category 'Layout' is often related to 'What is the problem…?' and 'Frameworks' issues often come with 'Is it possible…?' questions.},

This paper studies the trade-off between social welfare and fairness in referral networks. The traditional, naive mechanism yields high social welfare but at the cost of some agents--in particular, the "best" ones--being exploited. Autonomous agents would obviously not participate in such networks. An obvious mechanism such as reciprocity improves fairness but substantially lowers welfare. A more general incentive mechanism yields high fairness with only a small loss in welfare. This paper considers substructures of the network that emerge and cause the above outcomes.},

The deployments of Web 2.0 have created lot of impacts on enterprise KM sharing and reuse. Web 2.0 is used as platforms to improve ties in social networks as well as knowledge sharing and reuse activities in organizations. Many studies have shown that adoption of technologies in organizations is not the only success factor for enterprises knowledge creation and sharing among employees. Other factors such as organizational culture, man power, benefit schemes, budget and policy [33] in organizations are equally important.

Mathematical analysis results show that the optimal incentive contract is determined when both sides reach the stable equilibrium state. If the parameters change, enterprise will simultaneously adjust the incentive strategy, and the optimal action of project team will accordingly vary to maximize bilateral benefits.},

We first demonstrate that individuals' consumption habits influence their friend networks, consistent with the concept of homophily. We then show that one's social network can also influence the consumption of a submission through the activation of an extended friend network. Finally, we investigate the level of reciprocity, or balance, in the network and uncover relationships that are significantly less balanced than expected.},

abstract = {Q&amp;A sites have become popular to share and look for valuable knowledge. Users can easily and quickly access high quality answers to common questions. The main mechanism to label good answers is to count the votes per answer. This mechanism, however, does not consider whether other answers were present at the time when a vote is given. Consequently, good answers that were given later are likely to receive less votes than they would have received if given earlier. In this paper we present a Weighted Votes (WV) metric that gives different weights to the votes depending on how many answers were present when the vote is performed. The idea behind WV is to emphasize the answer that receives most of the votes when most of the answers were already posted. Mining the Stack Overflow data dump we show that the WV metric is able to highlight between 4.07\% and 10.82\% answers that differ from the most voted ones.},

abstract = {It is important to sharing knowledge among the variant actors in universities and institutes. However today’s widely used tools for knowledge sharing are much ineffective, which displays as either lack of semantics or inconvenience to use. In order to resolve the both deficiencies, paper introduces to P2P knowledge sharing system with folksonomies. A unified concept named knowledge space for representing various types of knowledge objects and its representation based on folksonomies are defined. Paper then gives two methods based on folksonomies to measure the similarity between different knowledge spaces and partition a knowledge space into several knowledge sub-spaces. Aiming at improving knowledge sharing more effective, paper proposes a semantic handshake process to form semantic communities, which fully applies the intelligence and negotiation of collectivity. At last architecture of P2P knowledge sharing system based on folksonomies is given and according to it a prototype system is implemented.},

abstract = {People that interact within a cooperative organization must constantly exchange information on the details of the organization as well as the goals the organization exists to meet. Agent organizations must share knowledge if they are to cooperatively act in the solution of some set of defined goals. The manner in which they share and when they share information varies. In this paper, we present the process to share organization information during the process of transition from one organization state to the next. Some organization models choose to vary the information known between two agents, in relation to the organization. A key element of organization success is that all members operate with the same information so as not to cause divergence in action or purpose.},

Based on theory of reasoned action and focusing on knowledge sharing setting, we propose that subjective norms and attitudes influence behavioral intention. Three processes drawing from social information processing theory (i.e., internalization, identification, and compliance) are postulated as antecedents of the intention to share knowledge. We also posit that knowledge type (as a moderator) intervenes the forming patterns of sharing behavior. Structural equation modeling was used to test hypotheses. Empirical data are collected from 229 respondents and our arguments were statistically supported. Some theoretical and practical implications are also discussed.},

abstract = {Stack Overflow has become an essential technical resource for developers. However, given the vast amount of knowledge available on Stack Overflow, finding the right information that is relevant for a given task is still challenging, especially when a developer is looking for a solution that applies to their specific requirements or technology stack. Clearly marking answers with their technical context, i.e., the information that characterizes the technologies and assumptions needed for this answer, is potentially one way to improve navigation. However, there is no information about how often such context is mentioned, and what kind of information it might offer. In this paper, we conduct an empirical study to understand the occurrence of technical context in Stack Overflow answers and comments, using tags as a proxy for technical context. We specifically focus on additional context, where answers/comments mention information that is not already discussed in the question. Our results show that nearly half of our studied threads contain at least one additional context. We find that almost 50\% of the additional context are either a library/framework, a programming language, a tool/application, an API, or a database. Overall, our findings show the promise of using additional context as navigational cues.},

However, knowledge sharing is still a delicate process because the willingness to share knowledge might be hindered by the lack of favorable cultural antecedents or functional and geographic distances between the persons involved. Existing studies concerning knowledge cultures have discovered isolated cultural values favorable for individual knowledge sharing. However, studies taking cultural elements and boundary spanning knowledge sharing into consideration are still missing. To close this gap, a qualitative and inductive study has been conducted in an Austrian engineering company. We researched cultural antecedents for knowledge sharing between project teams. The results provided by the analysis technique of GABEK indicate that there are several cultural elements that foster knowledge sharing across boundaries as well as starting points for managers and employees to develop a knowledge culture.},

Due to their highly collaborative nature, users can typically modify and create content without any access restrictions since these are replaced by social practices. On the other hand, due to the lack of central guidance, knowledge sharing is driven by the individual choice of contributors. We claim that --- especially in enterprise settings --- the lack of guidance for content creation is a major problem. We therefore analyze search and knowledge sharing in current Wikis. To improve knowledge sharing, we present the Woogle concept, which introduces "Social Search" and "Need-driven Knowledge Sharing" into Wikis. We describe our prototype implementation Woogle4MediaWiki and results from initial evaluation studies.},

Small organizations may be especially vulnerable due to reliance on key individuals and insufficient resource to employ several domain specialists. There is, however, minimal empirical research on sharing domain understanding in the context of small software organizations. In this paper we present the results of a field study of commercial software development practice in which we conducted semi-structured interviews with practitioners from ten such organizations. The study provides insights into practices, perceptions, and challenges related to developing shared domain understanding. Our results show that smaller organizations place particular emphasis on the use of prototypes or existing products to refine and verify domain understanding. Furthermore they perceive the biggest challenge to developing shared understanding as the quality of the client representative(s).},

This study draws on social exchange theory and proposes that exchange ideology would positively moderate the relationship between three perceived benefits (i.e., extrinsic rewards, reciprocity, and image) and virtual team members' knowledge sharing behavior. Data were collected from 113 members of 13 virtual student teams consisting of participants from Asia and Europe. Contrary to the team-member exchange theory, the findings suggest that, in GVTs, exchange ideology negatively moderates the relationships between extrinsic rewards, reciprocity and knowledge sharing, and had no moderating effect on the relationship between image and knowledge sharing. These results provoke theoretical implications that some contextual factors of GVTs may influence the moderating effects of individual difference. This study also provides some suggestions for the management of GVTs in knowledge sharing encouragement.},

Many agent-based applications either employ a basic form of knowledge sharing, or employ a more complicated form, such as the communication by word-of-mouth. The purpose of this paper is to provide an agent-based formalization of knowledge sharing. Such a unique solution includes the design and implementation of an agent-based Application Programming Interface (API) capable of allowing different forms of knowledge sharing between agents. In addition, a GUI is provided that interfaces with the agent-based API and provides visualization of agent simulations. The functionality of the API, and accompanying GUI, is demonstrated by the implementation of an agent-based traffic simulation. Moreover, the results of the agent-based traffic simulation are used to evaluate the effectiveness of alternative knowledge sharing methods.},

In order to achieve better learning convergence, several agents that learn separately are allowed to interchange each learned set of planning operators. Learning is achieved by establishing plans, executing those plans in the environment, analyzing the results of the execution, and combining new evidence with prior evidence. Operators are generated incrementally by combining rote learning, induction, and a variant of reinforcement learning. The results show how allowing the communication among individual learning (and planning) agents provides a much better percentage of successful plans, plus an improved convergence rate than the individual agents alone.},

We propose an ontology-based framework to capture, access and share developers' experiences in a decentralized, contextualized manner. Capturing developers' interaction with related artifacts and providing a Wiki-like annotation approach triggers knowledge capture. Integrated semantic search and recommendation fosters knowledge access and sharing. Our framework enables distributed teams to become more effective by learning from each other's experiences, e.g. on reusing specific components and handling semantic errors.},

abstract = {Trust can be applied to knowledge sharing on a distributed network of knowledge source agents. Each agent represents a person who trusts some other agents. Based on these trust-relationships, an agent can infer the trustworthiness of an unknown agent by asking trusted agents for recommendations. However, the person represented by an agent may not be willing to share his or her individual opinion about the trustworthiness of a particular agent to agents that do not protect information privacy. A solution for this issue is proposed using three kinds of privacy policies: generosity, caution, and non-cooperation. An agent that adopts the caution policy towards another agent will hide the details of the trust recommendation path. An analysis shows the effect of the privacy policies on the calculated reliabilities of the recommended trust values.},

abstract = {There exists "the prisoner's difficulty" between employees in the process of their knowledge sharing. Only by the way of being shared can knowledge develop and increase. Meanwhile, the effectiveness of knowledge sharing depends highly on the design of the organization structure. The author of this thesis which is based on the Game theory, by introducing the concept of "knowledge potential", analyzes the law of their knowledge sharing between different roles and gets the key source of knowledge sharing---introducing the strategy of stock ownership incentive to the staff with high-potential knowledge. The author makes a simulation experiment of an enterprise with nearly one-hundred employees on the Netlogo platform in this thesis, and sets different parameters of the knowledge sharing level to see how incentive mechanism can bring in the maximum income to the enterprise.},

abstract = {Entering knowledge economic age, the amount of enterprise holding knowledge and the ability to develop and utilize knowledge have been the sharp weapon to deal with market competition and the ever source to develop continuously, and knowledge sharing is the most important part of knowledge management. With nonstandard employing knowledge workers more and more common, the knowledge sharing between nonstandard employing and standard employing workers has been coming important for enterprise to accumulate and create knowledge. Firstly this paper divides nonstandard employment into four models based on labor contract and social embeddedness theoretic views, and then tests the knowledge sharing effectiveness difference among models by empirical research. The research show the knowledge sharing effectiveness of nonstandard employing knowledge workers are various, and the embeddedness into working organizational network is more vital impacting view comparing with the labor contract maturity.},

abstract = {Knowledge management (KM) plays the most important role in knowledge-intensive corporation. Knowledge sharing is a critical step for successful KM. It is a difficult problem for corporation to urge staff sharing knowledge which can increase the payoff in firm. In this paper, we establish incentive model in order to promote sharing knowledge. Through analyzing the model, many valuable conclusions are drawn for manager. This article points it is not need for the organization to inspirit staff sharing knowledge if one’s knowledge is little contribute and great conceal. It is better for the organization to adopt group-based reward than to adopt individual-based reward if staff’s knowledge is low conceal. It is suitable for the organization to adopt individual-based reward if staff’s knowledge is great contribute and conceal.},
