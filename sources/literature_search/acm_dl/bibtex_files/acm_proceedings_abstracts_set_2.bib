abstract = {Software developers routinely search for code using general-purpose search engines. However, these search engines cannot find code semantically unless it has an accompanying description. We propose a technique for semantic code search: A Convolutional Neural Network approach to code retrieval (CoNCRA). Our technique aims to find the code snippet that most closely matches the developer's intent, expressed in natural language. We evaluated our approach's efficacy on a dataset composed of questions and code snippets collected from Stack Overflow. Our preliminary results showed that our technique, which prioritizes local interactions (words nearby), improved the state-of-the-art (SOTA) by 5\% on average, retrieving the most relevant code snippets in the top 3 (three) positions by almost 80\% of the time. Therefore, our technique is promising and can improve the efficacy of semantic code retrieval.},

In order to study the interest driving of enterprise knowledge-sharing and the tactic choice under market supervision, the paper, through establishing the research hypothesis for game analysis, explores the repeated gaming between knowledge-sharing enterprise and customer as well as benefits changes and game equilibrium tactics in a supervisor sequential gaming context. The analysis results of benefits matrix show that, only when benefits of unlimited knowledge-sharing gaming are superior to that of limited knowledge-sharing gaming, the enterprise will be interested in continuing the knowledge-sharing. It is especially the case that under market supervision enterprise's knowledge will be a voluntary act. In order to efficiently upgrade enterprise's knowledge-sharing ability, enterprises should pay close attention to the optimization of knowledge transfer process, to the establishment of knowledge warning system, and respond actively to the market supervision.},

abstract = {Q&amp;A sites have become popular to share and look for valuable knowledge. Users can easily and quickly access high quality answers to common questions. The main mechanism to label good answers is to count the votes per answer. This mechanism, however, does not consider whether other answers were present at the time when a vote is given. Consequently, good answers that were given later are likely to receive less votes than they would have received if given earlier. In this paper we present a Weighted Votes (WV) metric that gives different weights to the votes depending on how many answers were present when the vote is performed. The idea behind WV is to emphasize the answer that receives most of the votes when most of the answers were already posted. Mining the Stack Overflow data dump we show that the WV metric is able to highlight between 4.07\% and 10.82\% answers that differ from the most voted ones.},

abstract = {Sentiment analysis (SA) of text-based software artifacts is increasingly used to extract information for various tasks including providing code suggestions, improving development team productivity, giving recommendations of software packages and libraries, and recommending comments on defects in source code, code quality, possibilities for improvement of applications. Studies of state-of-the-art sentiment analysis tools applied to software-related texts have shown varying results based on the techniques and training approaches. In this paper, we investigate the impact of two potential opportunities to improve the training for sentiment analysis of SE artifacts in the context of the use of neural networks customized using the Stack Overflow data developed by Lin et al.We customize the process of sentiment analysis to the software domain, using software domain-specific word embeddings learned from Stack Overflow (SO) posts, and study the impact of software domain-specific word embeddings on the performance of the sentiment analysis tool, as compared to generic word embeddings learned from Google News. We find that the word embeddings learned from the Google News data performs mostly similar and in some cases better than the word embeddings learned from SO posts. We also study the impact of two machine learning techniques, oversampling and undersampling of data, on the training of a sentiment classifier for handling small SE datasets with a skewed distribution. We find that oversampling alone, as well as the combination of oversampling and undersampling together, helps in improving the performance of a sentiment classifier.},

Thus, research is becoming more reachable both inside and outside of academic institutions and are found to be shared, downloaded and discussed in social media. In this study, we linked the scientific articles found in mainstream news, weblogs and Stack Overflow to the citation database of peer-reviewed literature called Scopus. We then explored how standard graph-based influence metrics can be used to measure the social impact of scientific articles. We also proposed the variant of Katz centrality metrics called EgoMet score to measure the local importance of scientific articles in its ego network. Later we evaluated these computed graph-based influence metrics by predicting absolute citations. Our results of the prediction model describe 34\% variance to predict citations from blogs and mainstream news and 44\% variance to predict citations from Stack Overflow.},

To account for these characteristics, we create knowledge sharing communities (KSC) that determine the community detection. KSC is driven by weighing the edge attributes as desired for the application that the communities are used. We provide an interactive algorithm that allows the operator to decide on the weights and the thresholds applied to create the communities. By choosing these variables, our results quantitatively outperform community detection on the collapsed monoplex network.},

Programmers increasingly rely on crowdsourced knowledge and code, as they look at Q&amp;A websites for answers or use code from publicly posted snippets. Programmers play, compete, and learn with the crowd, engaging in programming competitions and puzzles with crowds of programmers. Online IDEs make radically new forms of collaboration possible, allowing developers to synchronously program with crowds of distributed programmers. Programmer reputation is increasingly visible on Q&amp;A sites and public code repositories, opening new possibilities in how developers find jobs and companies identify talent. Crowds of non-programmers increasingly participate in development, usability testing software or even constructing specifications while playing games. Developers can take feedback from a crowd of users to guide further evolution of their applications. Crowdfunding democratizes choices about which software is built, broadening the software which might be feasibly constructed. Approaches for crowd development seek to microtask software development, dramatically increasing participation in open source by enabling software projects to be built through casual, transient work.},

abstract = {Programming community-based question-answering (PCQA) websites such as Stack Overflow enable programmers to find working solutions to their questions. Despite detailed posting guidelines, duplicate questions that have been answered are frequently created. To tackle this problem, Stack Overflow provides a mechanism for reputable users to manually mark duplicate questions. This is a laborious effort, and leads to many duplicate questions remain undetected. Existing duplicate detection methodologies from traditional community based question-answering (CQA) websites are difficult to be adopted directly to PCQA, as PCQA posts often contain source code which is linguistically very different from natural languages. In this paper, we propose a methodology designed for the PCQA domain to detect duplicate questions. We model the detection as a classification problem over question pairs. To extract features for question pairs, our methodology leverages continuous word vectors from the deep learning literature, topic model features and phrases pairs that co-occur frequently in duplicate questions mined using machine translation systems. These features capture semantic similarities between questions and produce a strong performance for duplicate detection. Experiments on a range of real-world datasets demonstrate that our method works very well; in some cases over 30\% improvement compared to state-of-the-art benchmarks. As a product of one of the proposed features, the association score feature, we have mined a set of associated phrases from duplicate questions on Stack Overflow and open the dataset to the public.},

abstract = {Actor concurrency is becoming increasingly important in the real world and mission-critical software. This requires these applications to be free from actor bugs, that occur in the real world, and have tests that are effective in finding these bugs. Mutation testing is a well-established technique that transforms an application to induce its likely bugs and evaluate the effectiveness of its tests in finding these bugs. Mutation testing is available for a broad spectrum of applications and their bugs, ranging from web to mobile to machine learning, and is used at scale in companies like Google and Facebook. However, there still is no mutation testing for actor concurrency that uses real-world actor bugs. In this paper, we propose 𝜇Akka, a framework for mutation testing of Akka actor concurrency using real actor bugs. Akka is a popular industrial-strength implementation of actor concurrency. To design, implement, and evaluate 𝜇Akka, we take the following major steps: (1) manually analyze a recent set of 186 real Akka bugs from Stack Overflow and GitHub to understand their causes; (2) design a set of 32 mutation operators, with 138 source code changes in Akka API, to emulate these causes and induce their bugs; (3) implement these operators in an Eclipse plugin for Java Akka; (4) use the plugin to generate 11.7k mutants of 10 real GitHub applications, with 446.4k lines of code and 7.9k tests; (5) run these tests on these mutants to measure the quality of mutants and effectiveness of tests; (6) use PIT to generate 26.2k mutants to compare 𝜇Akka and PIT mutant quality and test effectiveness. PIT is a popular mutation testing tool with traditional operators; (7) manually analyze the bug coverage and overlap of 𝜇Akka, PIT, and actor operators in a previous work; and (8) discuss a few implications of our findings. Among others, we find that 𝜇Akka mutants are higher quality, cover more bugs, and tests are less effective in detecting them.},

abstract = {Community Question Answering (CQA) websites, such as Stack Exchange1 or Quora2, allow users to freely ask questions and obtain answers from other users, i.e.,&nbsp;the community. Personal assistants, such as Amazon Alexa or Google Home, can also exploit CQA data to answer a broader range of questions and increase customers’ engagement. However, the voice-based interaction poses new challenges to the Question Answering scenario. Even assuming that we are able to retrieve a previously asked question that perfectly matches the user’s query, we cannot simply read its answer to the user. A major limitation is the answer length. Reading these answers to the user is cumbersome and boring. Furthermore, many answers contain non-voice-friendly parts, such as images, or URLs. In this paper, we define the Answer Reformulation task and propose a novel solution to automatically reformulate a community provided answer making it suitable for a voice interaction. Results on a manually annotated dataset3 extracted from Stack Exchange show that our models improve strong baselines.},

In contrast to Q&amp;A websites, which are strongly tied to practitioners' needs, there are systematic reviews (SRs), which, according to recent studies, lack a connection with software engineering practice. In this paper, we investigate this claim by assessing to what extent systematic reviews help to solve questions posted on Q&amp;A websites. To achieve this goal, we propose and evaluate a coverage method. We applied this method to a set of more than 600 questions related to agile software development. Results suggest that 12\% of the related questions were covered. When considering specific agile methods, the majority of them have coverage below 50\% or were not covered at all. We also identified 27 recurrent questions.},

abstract = {Learning the latent representations of entities based on their relationships and the data associated with them is an essential task in many applications such as ranking, recommendation systems, graph-based team formation, keyword search, and many more. However, the majority of existing techniques learn the latent representations of either network or textual data. Structural embedding techniques suffer from the sparsity of real-world networks. Attributes of nodes are a source of rich information to ameliorate network embedding vectors which are overlooked in the literature. Thus, most existing network representation learning tools capture structural information. This paper introduces an open-source toolkit called OpenAttHetRL to learn the latent representations of entities based on their both network and textual data in an end-to-end fashion. OpenAttHetRL is easy to employ and adapt for a variety of tasks including ranking, recommendation systems, and expert finding. OpenAttHetRL aims to provide a unified toolkit for data pre-processing, building and training models, and performing predictions for a downstream task. It employs a graph convolution network to capture the relationships among entities and a kernel pooling technique to preserve the similarity of their textual data in the embedding space. We use expert finding in community question answering systems to demonstrate how OpenAttHetRL can be trained to get latent representations of questions, their askers, tags, and answerers and find potential answerers of new questions.},

Given the steep learning curve for these feature-rich software applications, many instructors turn to online Q&amp;A forums for help with learning and troubleshooting their LMS. We analyzed the content of 250 posts from a community-based Q&amp;A forum for Canvas, a widely-used LMS, finding several recurring themes that illustrate how instructors are setting up courses for the first time, facilitating shared experiences between their students, and even seeking innovative ways to customize their course delivery.

Research efforts are focusing on virtual assistants that support specific software development tasks such as bug repair and pair programming. In this paper, we study the use of online chat platforms as a resource towards collecting developer opinions that could potentially help in building opinion Q&amp;A systems, as a specialized instance of virtual assistants and chatbots for software engineers. Opinion Q&amp;A has a stronger presence in chats than in other developer communications, thus mining them can provide a valuable resource for developers in quickly getting insight about a specific development topic (e.g., What is the best Java library for parsing JSON?). We address the problem of opinion Q&amp;A extraction by developing automatic identification of opinion-asking questions and extraction of participants' answers from public online developer chats. We evaluate our automatic approaches on chats spanning six programming communities and two platforms. Our results show that a heuristic approach to opinion-asking questions works well (.87 precision), and a deep learning approach customized to the software domain outperforms heuristics-based, machine-learning-based and deep learning for answer extraction in community question answering.},

abstract = {The paper presents results from a pilot questionnaire-based study on ten Stack Overflow (SO) questions. Eleven developers were tasked with determining if the SO question sentiment was positive, negative or neutral. The results from the questionnaire indicate that developers mostly rated the sentiment of SO questions as neutral, stating that they received little or no emotional feedback from the questions. Tools that were designed to analyze Software Engineering related texts (SentiStrength-SE, SentiCR, and Senti4SD) were on average more closely aligned with developer ratings for a majority of the questions than general purpose tools for detecting SO question sentiment. We discuss cases where tools and developer sentiment differ along with implications of the results. Overall, the sentiment tool output on the question title and body is more aligned with the developer rating than just the title alone. Since SO is a very common medium of technical exchange, we also report that adding code snippets, short titles, and multiple tags were top three features developers prefer in SO questions in order for it to be answered quickly.},

abstract = {Stack Overflow is the most popular Community based Question Answering (CQA) website for programmers on the web with 2.05M users, 5.1M questions and 9.4M answers. Stack Overflow has explicit, detailed guidelines on how to post questions and an ebullient moderation community. Despite these precise communications and safeguards, questions posted on Stack Overflow can be extremely off topic or very poor in quality. Such questions can be deleted from Stack Overflow at the discretion of experienced community members and moderators. We present the first study of deleted questions on Stack Overflow. We divide our study into two parts - (i) Characterization of deleted questions over ~5 years (2008-2013) of data, (ii) Prediction of deletion at the time of question creation. Our characterization study reveals multiple insights on question deletion phenomena. We find that it takes substantial time to vote a question to be deleted but once voted, the community takes swift action. We also see that question authors delete their questions to salvage reputation points. We notice some instances of accidental deletion of good quality questions but such questions are voted back to be undeleted quickly. We discover a pyramidal structure of question quality on Stack Overflow and find that deleted questions lie at the bottom (lowest quality) of the pyramid. We also build a predictive model to detect the deletion of question at the creation time. We experiment with 47 features -- based on User Profile, Community Generated, Question Content and Syntactic style -- and report an accuracy of 66\%. Our findings reveal important suggestions for content quality maintenance on community based question answering websites. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first large scale study on poor quality (deleted) questions on Stack Overflow.},

This technique is designed for detecting if a particular stack value, namely a return address, was corrupted because of a stack overflow. Thus, DStack is useful for identifying intrusion attempts but also for checking the run-time robustness of applications. We implemented a proof-of-concept tool based on Pin, a popular dynamic binary instrumentation framework.

abstract = {In this paper, we propose a deep multi-Task learning model based on Adversarial-and-COoperative nets (TACO). The goal is to use an adversarial-and-cooperative strategy to decouple the task-common and task-specific knowledge, facilitating the fine-grained knowledge sharing among tasks. TACO accommodates multiple game players, i.e., feature extractors, domain discriminator, and tri-classifiers. They play the MinMax games adversarially and cooperatively to distill the task-common and task-specific features, while respecting their discriminative structures. Moreover, it adopts a divide-and-combine strategy to leverage the decoupled multiview information to further improve the generalization performance of the model. The experimental results show that our proposed method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms on the benchmark datasets in both multi-task learning and semi-supervised domain adaptation scenarios.},

abstract = {Context: Systematic Literature Review (SLR) or Systematic Mapping Study (SMS) are a process in which publications dataset is systematically analyzed to cover a research field. These processes involve multiple investigators collaborating to produce more improved work and often use automated tools to facilitate their work. Problem: However, not all tools offer proper support to collaborative SLR or SMS. That is, missing a tool to support the study selection process, allowing the collaboration between researchers by applying individual criteria and collective decision, supported by agreement or discussion and consensus. Solution: We developed the Porifera tool to fill this lack. IS Theory: Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and a Grounded Theory’s phase subset were used to evaluate Porifera’s tool quality. Methodology: Undergraduate and postgraduate students enrolled in the Experimental Software Engineering Research,used the Porifera tool and answered a post-used questionnaire with TAM’s sentences and other open questions. Then, a quantitative and qualitative analysis was performed. Summary of Results: It was possible to see high perceived usefulness and ease of use for Porifera. Too it noted the effectiveness of resources to support the collaborative activity and its contribution to learning and performing a collaborative SLR or SMS. The evaluation showed points to improve the Porifera’s interface. Contribution and Impact in the IS area: The Porifera is an IS for data, information, and knowledge research management because it gathers publications records and allows it will be interpreted and processed, making possible decisions making by researchers. The Porifera also allows performing an SLR or SMS with mobility, knowledge sharing, flexibility, and integration between people and technology.},

abstract = {Rust is a young systems programming language designed to provide both the safety guarantees of high-level languages and the execution performance of low-level languages. To achieve this design goal, Rust provides a suite of safety rules and checks against those rules at the compile time to eliminate many memory-safety and thread-safety issues. Due to its safety and performance, Rust's popularity has increased significantly in recent years, and it has already been adopted to build many safety-critical software systems.It is critical to understand the learning and programming challenges imposed by Rust's safety rules. For this purpose, we first conducted an empirical study through close, manual inspection of 100 Rust-related Stack Overflow questions. We sought to understand (1) what safety rules are challenging to learn and program with, (2) under which contexts a safety rule becomes more difficult to apply, and (3) whether the Rust compiler is sufficiently helpful in debugging safety-rule violations. We then performed an online survey with 101 Rust programmers to validate the findings of the empirical study. We invited participants to evaluate program variants that differ from each other, either in terms of violated safety rules or the code constructs involved in the violation, and compared the participants' performance on the variants. Our mixed-methods investigation revealed a range of consistent findings that can benefit Rust learners, practitioners, and language designers.},

In this context, the existing tools like SentiCR, SentiStrength-SE, etc. exhibited low f1-scores that completely defeats the purpose of deployment of such strategies, thereby there is enough scope for performance improvement. Recent advancements show that transformer based pre-trained models (e.g., BERT, RoBERTa, ALBERT, etc.) have displayed better results in the text classification task. Following this context, the present research explores different BERT-based models to analyze the sentences in GitHub comments, Jira comments, and Stack Overflow posts. The paper presents three different strategies to analyse BERT based model for sentiment analysis, where in the first strategy the BERT based pre-trained models are fine-tuned; in the second strategy an ensemble model is developed from BERT variants, and in the third strategy a compressed model (Distil BERT) is used. The experimental results show that the BERT based ensemble approach and the compressed BERT model attain improvements by 6–12\% over prevailing tools for the F1 measure on all three datasets.},

We observe that several comments posted in issue tracking system contains link to external websites such as YouTube (video sharing website), Twitter (micro-blogging website), Stack overflow (a community-based question and answering website for programmers), Wikipedia and focused discussions forums. Stack overflow is a popular community-based question and answering website for programmers and is widely used by software engineers as it contains answers to millions of questions (an extensive knowledge resource) posted by programmers on diverse topics. We conduct a series of experiments on open-source Google Chromium and Android issue tracker data (publicly available real-world dataset) to understand the role and impact of Stack overflow in issue resolution. Our experimental results show evidences of several references to Stack overflow in threaded discussions and demonstrate correlation between a lower mean time to repair (in one dataset) with presence of Stack overflow links. We also observe that the average number of comments posted in response to bug reports are less when Stack overflow links are presented in contrast to bug reports not containing Stack overflow references. We conduct experiments based on textual similarly analysis (content-based linguistic features) and contextual data analysis (exploited metadata such as tags associated to a Stack overflow question) to recommend Stack overflow questions for an incoming bug report. We perform empirical analysis to measure the effectiveness of the proposed method on a dataset containing ground-truth and present our insights. We present the result of a survey (of Google Chromium Developers) that we conducted to understand practitioner's perspective and experience.},

However, many organisations have ignored the importance of knowledge sharing among employees within an organisation. Recently, organisational culture has emerged as a key factor influencing the extent of knowledge sharing between employees. This paper aims to investigate the role of specific dimensions of organisational culture in the success of knowledge sharing. One of these dimensions, suggested by Hofstede, examined the difference between means oriented and goal oriented organisational cultures. In a means oriented culture, people avoid taking risks, only exhibit a limited effort at their jobs and spend their time caught in a routine. In contrast, workers in a goal oriented culture tend to be concerned about what needs to be achieved, are willing to try new approaches and sometimes take risks. The current review investigated special relationships between knowledge sharing behaviours at the work place, with regard to means oriented and goals oriented organizational culture dimensions.},

abstract = {Attentional, RNN-based encoder-decoder architectures have achieved impressive performance on abstractive summarization of news articles. However, these methods fail to account for long term dependencies within the sentences of a document. This problem is exacerbated in multi-document summarization tasks such as summarizing the popular opinion in threads present in community question answering (CQA) websites such as Yahoo! Answers and Quora. These threads contain answers which often overlap or contradict each other. In this work, we present a hierarchical encoder based on structural attention to model such inter-sentence and inter-document dependencies. We set the popular pointer-generator architecture and some of the architectures derived from it as our baselines and show that they fail to generate good summaries in a multi-document setting. We further illustrate that our proposed model achieves significant improvement over the baselines in both single and multidocument summarization settings - in the former setting, it beats the best baseline by 1.31 and 7.8 ROUGE-1 points on CNN and CQA datasets, respectively; in the latter setting, the performance is further improved by 1.6 ROUGE-1 points on the CQA dataset.},

abstract = {Although online learning environments are perceived to facilitate knowledge sharing among individuals, various empirical studies find that participants do not log on frequently or are reluctant to share ideas with others. It is thus crucial for educators to understand when and how online knowledge sharing occurs. Prior model framework has been adapted to explore the motivational factors that drive knowledge sharing among individuals in online learning environments, esp. if there are any gender differences of online knowledge sharing. The hypothesized relationships between the identified motivational factors and online knowledge sharing behavior are then tested using a survey questionnaire administered to a sample of 333 undergraduate students. The results indicate that perceived attachment motivation (the need to form) and perceived relationship commitment (the need to main a relationship) are important determinants of online knowledge sharing. Further analysis on gender differences reveals that male participants rated the need to form relationships more highly than their female counterparts. Implications to ensure online learning environments to encourage knowledge sharing behavior are discussed.},

However, hardly any studies are conducted to determine whether the actual problems developers encounter are sufficiently addressed. For the relatively young field of GPU programming, we would like to know whether the tools developed so far are sufficient, or whether some problems still need attention. To this end, we first look at what kind of problems programmers encounter in OpenCL and CUDA. We gather problems from Stack Overflow and categorise them with card sorting. We find that problems related to memory, synchronisation of threads, threads in general and performance are essential topics. Next, we look at (verification) tools in industry and research, to see how these tools addressed the problems we discovered. We think many problems are already properly addressed, but there is still a need for easy to use sound tools. Alternatively, languages or programming styles can be created, that allows for easier checking for soundness

As sanitization of such logs is an unsolved research problem, commercial Web search engines that possess large datasets of this kind at their disposal refrain from disseminating them to the wider research community. Ironically, studies examining privacy in search often require detailed search logs with user profiles. This paper builds on an observation that information needs are also expressed in the form of questions in online Community Question Answering (CQA) communities. We take a step towards understanding the process of formulating queries from questions to form a basis for automatic derivation of search logs from CQA forums. Specifically, we sample natural language (NL) questions spanning diverse themes from the StackExchange platform, and conduct a large-scale conversion experiment where crowdworkers submit search queries they would use when looking for equivalent information. We also release a dataset of 7,000 question-query pairs from our study.},

However, someone asking a question may not necessarily know the best way to categorize or tag the question, and automatically tagging or categorizing a question is a challenging task. Since a Q&amp;A site may host millions of questions with tags and other data, this information can be used as a training and test dataset for approaches that automatically suggest tags for new questions. In this paper, we mine data from millions of questions from the Q&amp;A site Stack Overflow, and using a discriminative model approach, we automatically suggest question tags to help a questioner choose appropriate tags for eliciting a response.},

abstract = {Community-based question answering services accumulate large volumes of knowledge through the voluntary services of people across the globe. Stack Overflow is an example of such a service that targets developers and software engineers. In general, questions in Stack Overflow are answered in a very short time. However, we found that the number of unanswered questions has increased significantly in the past two years. Understanding why questions remain unanswered can help information seekers improve the quality of their questions, increase their chances of getting answers, and better decide when to use Stack Overflow services. In this paper, we mine data on unanswered questions from Stack Overflow. We then conduct a qualitative study to categorize unanswered questions, which reveals characteristics that would be difficult to find otherwise. Finally, we conduct an experiment to determine whether we can predict how long a question will remain unanswered in Stack Overflow.},

abstract = {Textbook question answering (TQA) is a multi-modal task that requires complex parsing and reasoning over scientific diagrams and long text to answer various types of questions, including true/false questions, reading comprehension, and diagram questions, making TQA a superset of question answering (QA) and visual question answering (VQA). In this paper, we introduce a Multi-Head TQA architecture (MHTQA) for solving the TQA task. To overcome the long text issue, we apply the open-source search engine Solr to select sentences from lesson essays. In order to answer questions that have different input formats and share knowledge, we build a bottom-shared model with a transformer and three QA networks. For diagram questions, previous approaches did not incorporate the textual context to produce diagram representation, resulting in insufficient utilize of diagram semantic information. To address this issue, we learn a contextualized diagram representation through the novel Contextualized Iterative Dual Fusion network (CIDF) using the visual and semantic features of the diagram image and the lesson essays. We jointly train different types of questions in a multi-task learning manner for knowledge sharing by an efficient sampling strategy of Multi-type Question Learning (MQL). The experimental results show that our model outperforms the existing single model on all question types by a margin of 4.6\%, 1.7\%, 1\%, 1.9\% accuracy on Text T/F, Text MC, Diagram, and overall accuracy.},

abstract = {Stack Overflow is a popular on-line programming question and answer community providing its participants with rapid access to knowledge and expertise of their peers, especially benefitting coders. Despite the popularity of Stack Overflow, its role in the work cycle of open-source developers is yet to be understood: on the one hand, participation in it has the potential to increase the knowledge of individual developers thus improving and speeding up the development process. On the other hand, participation in Stack Overflow may interrupt the regular working rhythm of the developer, hence also possibly slow down the development process. In this paper we investigate the interplay between Stack Overflow activities and the development process, reflected by code changes committed to the largest social coding repository, GitHub. Our study shows that active GitHub committers ask fewer questions and provide more answers than others. Moreover, we observe that active Stack Overflow askers distribute their work in a less uniform way than developers that do not ask questions. Finally, we show that despite the interruptions incurred, the Stack Overflow activity rate correlates with the code changing activity in GitHub.},

abstract = {The sheer number of available technologies and the complex relationships among them make it challenging to choose the right technologies for software projects. Developers often turn to online resources (e.g., expert articles and community answers) to get a good understanding of the technology landscape. Such online resources are primarily opinion-based and are often out of date. Furthermore, information is often scattered in many online resources, which has to be aggregated to have a big picture of the technology landscape. In this paper, we exploit the fact that Stack Overflow users tag their questions with the main technologies that the questions revolve around, and develop association rule mining and community detection techniques to mine technology landscape from Stack Overflow question tags. The mined technology landscape is represented in a graphical Technology Associative Network (TAN). Our empirical study shows that the mined TAN captures a wide range of technologies, the complex relationships among the technologies, and the trend of the technologies in the developers' discussions on Stack Overflow. We develop a website (https://graphofknowledge.appspot.com/) for the community to access and evaluate the mined technology landscape. The website visit statistics by Google Analytics shows the developers' general interests in our technology landscape service. We also report a small-scale user study to evaluate the potential usefulness of our tool.},

abstract = {Software developers are rarely security experts and often struggle with security-related programming tasks. The resources developers use to work on them, such as Stack-Overflow or Documentation, have a significant impact on the security of the code they produce. However, work by Acar ethas shown that these resources are often either easy to use but insecure or secure but hard to use. In a study by Naiakshina et al. [44], it was shown that developers who did not use resources to copy and paste code did not produce any secure solutions at all. This highlights how essential programming resources are for security. Inspired by the Let's Encrypt and Certbot that support admins in configuring TLS, we created a programming aid called Let's Hash to help developers create secure password authentication code easily. We created two versions. The first is a collection of code snippets developers can use, and the second adds a wizard interface on top that guides developers through the decisions which need to be made and creates the complete code for them. To evaluate the security and usability of Let's Hash, we conducted a study with 179 freelance developers, asking them to solve three password programming tasks. Both versions of Let's Hash significantly outperformed the baseline condition in which developers used their regular resources. On average, Let's Hash users were between 5 and 32 times as likely to create secure code than those in the control condition.},

abstract = {Evaluating student learning in K-12 computer science programs is challenging due to the limited number of validated assessments, especially below the high school level. Because computer science is often taught as an engineering-oriented discipline in K-12, it seems natural to use students' programming projects as evidence of student learning. However, this approach is time-consuming and can overestimate what students understand. In this paper, we share our experience with using students' programming projects as a tool for evaluating a middle school computer science program at San Francisco Unified School District. The scoring and analysis of programming projects did generate useful insights about the nature of student learning in the program. More importantly, we found that the process of co-developing a scoring rubric and scoring projects alongside CS classroom teachers generated rich discussions and knowledge-sharing about the current state of the district's CS program, its values, and its long-term goals.},

As videos can be attractive and fun materials for L2 learners who are learning English as a foreign language, this system is hopefully able to support them to be exposed to collocations by watching videos especially in terms of drama types. After recognizing collocations used in drama videos, L2 learners can look for further explanations and instances via an online concordancer integrated into this learning system. There were also functions including knowledge sharing, online assessment, and learning portfolio. In order to detect the usefulness and usability of the proposed system, we initially identified a small sum of the users’ perception as a pilot test. This preliminary result exhibited that these participants agreed the proposed system could help them learn English collocations.},

Hyperedges, which compose a hypergraph, are non-empty subsets of any number of nodes, and thus each hyperedge naturally represents a group interaction among entities. The higher-order nature of hypergraphs brings about unique structural properties that have not been considered in ordinary pairwise graphs. In this tutorial, we offer a comprehensive overview of a new research topic called hypergraph mining. We first present recently revealed structural properties of real-world hypergraphs, including (a) static and dynamic patterns, (b) global and local patterns, and (c) connectivity and overlapping patterns. Together with the patterns, we describe advanced data mining tools used for their discovery. Lastly, we introduce simple yet realistic hypergraph generative models that provide an explanation of the structural properties.},

abstract = {How can we create a global food network?Attempts are being made worldwide to lead people to healthier eating habits. They are not always in the academic field but often on a small scale and privately, in hospitals, nursing homes, schools, and various organizations. They may be collecting and manually analyzing data such as recipes and food records. They are precious data, but in many cases, they are never made public. And in academia, dictionaries, corpora, and knowledge graphs are constructed manually at a high cost, but such knowledge is never shared, and another group continues to generate new knowledge. How can we reduce this wasteful work and allow data and knowledge to be shared and leveraged?There are several issues involved in sharing food data. First, food cultures differ from country to country and region to region. Food data produced in one area rarely works as in another. Food data, especially when linked to medical care, is likely to contain private information and must be anonymized when shared. Anonymizing data without losing its intrinsic value is complex, and knowledge sharing must be abandoned in many cases. In addition, food logging is burdensome. Eating takes place every day, multiple times a day. Recording every meal requires a tremendous amount of effort. However, the impact of a single meal on a person's body is minimal, and it is the long-term record that is important in guiding a person to good health.In this panel discussion, we invite Prof. Stavroula Mougiakakou, General Chair of MADiMa22, a workshop co-located with CEA++22, and Prof. Ramesh Jain, the keynote speaker of CEA++22, to discuss the issues raised above.

abstract = {Q \&amp; A forums on the web are aplenty and the content produced through such crowd-sourced efforts is generally of good quality and highly beneficial to novices and experts alike. As the community matures, however, the explosion in the number of posts/answers leads to the information overload problem. Many a times users having expertise in a particular area are not able to address quality issues raised in the area maybe due to the positioning of the question in the list displayed to the user. A good mechanism to assess the quality of questions and to display it to the users depending on their area of expertise, if devised, may lead to a higher quality answers and faster resolutions to the questions posted. In this paper we present the results of our investigations into the effectiveness of various mechanisms to represent user expertise to estimate a post score reflecting its quality/utility of the post. We follow three different approaches to building a user profile representing the user's areas of expertise: topic models based approach, tag-based approach and semantic user profiling approaches. We present the results of experiments performed on the popular Q&amp;A Forum Stack Overflow, exploring the value add offered by these approaches. The preliminary experiments support our hypothesis that considering additional features in terms of user expertise does offer an increase in the classification accuracy even while ignoring features computable only after the first 24 hours. However, the proposed method to individually leverage on the semantic tag relations to construct an enhanced user profile did not prove beneficial.},

abstract = {Machine Reading Comprehension (MRC) is an important NLP task with the goal of extracting answers to user questions from background passages. For conversational applications, modeling the contexts under the multi-turn setting is highly necessary for MRC, which has drawn great attention recently. Past studies on multi-turn MRC usually focus on a single domain, ignoring the fact that knowledge in different MRC tasks are transferable. To address this issue, we present a unified framework to model both single-turn and multi-turn MRC tasks which allows knowledge sharing from different source MRC tasks to help solve the target MRC task. Specifically, the Context-Aware Transferable Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (CAT-BERT) model is proposed, which jointly learns to solve both single-turn and multi-turn MRC tasks in a single pre-trained language model. In this model, both history questions and answers are encoded into the contexts for the multi-turn setting. To capture the task-level importance of different layer outputs, a task-specific attention layer is further added to the CAT-BERT outputs, reflecting the positions that the model should pay attention to for a specific MRC task. Extensive experimental results and ablation studies show that CAT-BERT achieves competitive results in multi-turn MRC tasks, outperforming strong baselines.},

abstract = {Medical sector is one of the important domains in current society. This paper focuses on the patient treatment processes, in case of requiring prosthesis implantation. The specificity of such a process is that it makes connections between two lifecycles belonging to medical and engineering domains respectively. This implies several collaborative actions between stakeholders from heterogeneous disciplines. However, several problems of communication and knowledge sharing may occur because of the variety of semantic used and the specific business practices in each domain. In this context, this paper is interested in the potential of knowledge engineering and product lifecycle management approaches to cope with the above problems. To do so, a conceptual framework is proposed for the analysis of links between the disease (medical domain) and the prosthesis (engineering domain) lifecycles. Based on this analysis, a combined KM-PLM based approach is proposed. The application of the proposition is demonstrated through an implementation of useful function in the AUDROS PLM software.},

Based on the characteristics of reverse supply chain, four kinds of knowledge sharing models, which are initiative sharing, knowledge license, contract incentive and integrated collaboration, were proposed. The backgrounds and features of each pattern are analyzed. Finally, some suggestions for implementation of the knowledge-sharing models are proposed.},

abstract = {This paper empirically analyzes collaborative relationships among craftsmen and their suppliers in the food and beverage industry. Despite the recent return to traditional manufacturing methods triggered by customers’ attention, the literature debate on supply chain collaboration, in this field, has received limited research attention. In particular, the paper aims at investigating information and knowledge sharing in craft production environments by addressing the following research questions: RQ1. What type of information and knowledge is shared? RQ2. What are the main antecedents that lead to exchange information and knowledge with suppliers? RQ3. What are the benefits? The qualitative critical analysis carried out to derive empirical evidence was based on multiple case studies involving eight companies, either ice cream artisans or craft beer producers. Collected data have been analyzed focusing on type, direction and amount of the shared contents. The size of the company and the location of supplier are the most impacting factors other than the craftwork approach to explain the emerged behavior. Knowledge exchange resulted to be more important than information sharing. The paper has a twofold contribution: on one hand, it fills the highlighted literature gap; on the other, it provides practitioners with hints to better understanding their playing field.},

abstract = {Part-of-speech (POS) tagging performance degrades on out-of-domain data due to the lack of domain knowledge. Software engineering knowledge, embodied in textual documentations, bug reports and online forum discussions, is expressed in natural language, but is full of domain terms, software entities and software-specific informal languages. Such software texts call for software-specific POS tagging. In the software engineering community, there have been several attempts leveraging POS tagging technique to help solve software engineering tasks. However, little work is done for POS tagging on software natural language texts.In this paper, we build a software-specific POS tagger, called S-POS, for processing the textual discussions on Stack Overflow. We target at Stack Overflow because it has become an important developer-generated knowledge repository for software engineering. We define a POS tagset that is suitable for describing software engineering knowledge, select corpus, develop a custom tokenizer, annotate data, design features for supervised model training, and demonstrate that the tagging accuracy of S-POS outperforms that of the Stanford POS Tagger when tagging software texts. Our work presents a feasible roadmap to build software-specific POS tagger for the socio-professional contents on Stack Overflow, and reveals challenges and opportunities for advanced software-specific information extraction.},

While previous work focuses on FAQ mining and answering queries from FAQ pages, there is no work on verifying completeness or augmenting FAQ pages. We present a system, called FAQAugmenter, which given an FAQ web page, (1) harnesses signals from query logs and the web corpus to identify missing topics, and (2) suggests ranked list of questions for FAQ web page augmentation. Our experiments with FAQ pages from five enterprises each across three categories (banks, hospitals and airports) show that FAQAugmenter suggests high quality relevant questions. FAQAugmenter will contribute significantly not just in improving quality of FAQ web pages but also in turn improving quality of downstream applications like Microsoft QnA Maker.},

abstract = {Information service is an important assistive tool in the knowledge sharing process. The knowledge sharing process covers a wide range of operations ranging from a course registration process to flight ticket buying. A good service could help both the service providers and the service users. The service users could get the right information at the right time and at the right place; whereas the service providers could reduce the amount of work created by uninformed users. In this paper, an electronic service framework (e-service) is proposed to assist the information service. This framework is based on an information retrieval technique to discover information. As a result, the information can be accessed at any place and any time. Furthermore, the issue of information quality is also a part of this framework. Each piece of information will be provided with tags and a weight. The tags will be used for categorization while the weight will be used to determine the quality of the information. Ultimately, the information will be evaluated by the users whose comments and scores will later be used to improve the system.},

abstract = {Social media have become very popular. The number of social media users, and the number of interactions among them, is huge. The social media environment plays host to a range of activities, including the exchange of photos and video media, the exchange of ideas and comments, and the building of personal and career networks. Accordingly, the social media environment also serves as a useful supplement to informal learning outside the classroom for both full-time students and adult learners. It is thus crucial that educators understand the determinants of online knowledge sharing. In this study, an existing model framework is adapted to explore the motivational factors that drive knowledge sharing among individuals in the social media environment, particularly to determine whether there are any attachment style differences in online knowledge sharing. The hypothesized relationships between the motivational factors identified and online knowledge sharing behavior are then tested using a survey questionnaire administered to 3,590 post-secondary students applying to a local university. The results indicate that perceived attachment motivation (the need to form a relationship) and perceived relationship commitment (the need to maintain a relationship) are important determinants of online knowledge sharing. Further analysis of attachment styles reveals that high attachment-style individuals rate the need to form relationships more highly than their low attachment-style counterparts. However, the results are the reverse for the need to maintain a relationship. The implications for the encouragement of knowledge sharing behavior in the social media environment are discussed.},

abstract = {Tagging facilitates information retrieval in social media and other online communities by allowing users to organize and describe online content. Researchers found that the efficiency of tagging systems steadily decreases over time, because tags become less precise in identifying specific documents, i.e., they lose their descriptiveness. However, previous works did not answer how or even whether community managers can improve the efficiency of tags. In this work, we use information-theoretic measures to track the descriptive and retrieval efficiency of tags on Stack Overflow, a question-answering system that strictly limits the number of tags users can specify per question. We observe that tagging efficiency stabilizes over time, while tag content and descriptiveness both increase. To explain this observation, we hypothesize that limiting the number of tags fosters novelty and diversity in tag usage, two properties which are both beneficial for tagging efficiency. To provide qualitative evidence supporting our hypothesis, we present a statistical model of tagging that demonstrates how novelty and diversity lead to greater tag efficiency in the long run. Our work offers insights into policies to improve information organization and retrieval in online communities.},

abstract = {Taking advantage of the rapid growth of community platforms, such as Yahoo Answers, Quora, etc., Community Question Answering (CQA) systems are developed to retrieve semantically equivalent questions when users raise a new query. A typical CQA system mainly consists of two key components, a retrieval model and a ranking model, to search for similar questions and select the most related, respectively. In this paper, we propose LARQ, Learning to Ask and Rewrite Questions, which is a novel sentence-level data augmentation method. Different from common lexical-level data augmentation progresses, we take advantage of the Question Generation (QG) model to obtain more accurate, diverse, and semantically-rich query examples. Since the queries differ greatly in a low-resource code-start scenario, incorporating the QG model as an augmentation to the indexed collection significantly improves the response rate of CQA systems. We incorporate LARQ in an online CQA system and the Bank Question (BQ) Corpus to evaluate the enhancements for both the retrieval process and the ranking model. Extensive experimental results show that the LARQ enhanced model significantly outperforms single BERT and XGBoost models, as well as a widely-used QG model (NQG).},

abstract = {In large-scale multi-agent systems, the existence of a large number of agents with different target tasks and connected by complex game relationships causes great difficulty for policy learning. Therefore, simplifying the learning process is an important issue. In multi-agent systems, agents with the same target tasks or attributes often interact more with each other and exhibit behaviors more similar. That means there are stronger collaborations between these agents. Most existing multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithms expect to learn the collaborative strategies of all agents directly in order to maximize the common rewards. This causes the difficulty of policy learning to increase exponentially as the number and types of agents increase. To address this problem, we propose a goal-based hierarchical group communication (GHGC) algorithm. This algorithm divides the agents into different groups, and maintains the group’s cognitive consistency through knowledge sharing. Subsequently, we introduce a group communication and value decomposition method to ensure cooperation between the various groups. Experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art MARL methods on the widely adopted StarCraft II benchmarks across different scenarios, and also possesses potential value for large-scale real-world applications.},

abstract = {This full research paper focuses on the design of a Teaching Practices Management System (TPMS) which supports the sharing of teaching practices (TPs) amongst computer science instructors. Many years of valuable TPs can be lost due to academic retirement when no competent knowledge management system is available for recording these TPs. Consequently, novice teachers are currently facing critical challenges when delivering subject knowledge that relates to algorithms, programming and the development of computational thinking skills without the benefit of others’ experience. After a study of the relevant literature, it could be seen that far too little attention has been paid to the capturing and sharing of TPs which are not easily expressed or communicated in visual or verbal terms. Thus, we design and then demonstrate a Teaching Practices Management System (TPMS) which supports the capturing of TPs. A quantitative and a qualitative evaluation of users’ experiences of employing the system shows that instructors are satisfied with it and are mostly positive about its features. The findings of this study hold considerable promise in relation to developing engaging and effective knowledge sharing systems for use by academic instructors.},

abstract = {The ARQMath Lab at CLEF 2020 considers the problem of finding answers to new mathematical questions among posted answers on a community question answering site (Math Stack Exchange). Queries are question postings held out from the test collection, each containing both text and at least one formula. We expect this to be a challenging task, as both math and text may be needed to find relevant answer posts. While several models have been proposed for text question answering, math question answering is in an earlier stage of development. To advance math-aware search and mathematical question answering systems, we will create a standard test collection for researchers to use for benchmarking. ARQMath will also include a formula retrieval sub-task: individual formulas from question posts are used to locate formulas in earlier answer posts, with relevance determined by narrative fields created based on the original question. We will use these narrative fields to explore diverse information needs for formula search (e.g., alternative notation, applications in specific fields or definition).},

Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA) is one of the social science theories which are vastly used to understand human behavior and is also considered as a strong base to understand knowledge sharing behavior. Hence this study will use the same theory to understand individual’s knowledge sharing behavior and specifically how extrinsic rewards can affect knowledge sharing attitude. Hence the objective of this study is to propose a framework of individual’s knowledge sharing attitude by using literature from different sources. The study will also propose five hypotheses based on the proposed framework. The study will examine (1) the effect of extrinsic rewards on knowledge sharing attitude (2) How demographic variables effect the relationship between extrinsic rewards and knowledge sharing attitude? (3) What is the effect of OCBs on the effect of extrinsic rewards on knowledge sharing attitude?(4) What is the impact of employee’s knowledge sharing attitude on his/her intention towards knowledge sharing? And (5) what is the impact of employee’s knowledge sharing intention on his knowledge sharing behavior? This will help us to understand how extrinsic motivation influence an individual’s knowledge sharing attitude and how his intrinsic attributes strengthen or weaken this relationship.},

The existing methods for taxonomy matching mostly depend on string lexical features and domain-specific information. In this paper, we consider the method of representation learning of taxonomies, which projects categories and relationships into low-dimensional vector spaces. We propose a method to takes advantages of category hierarchies and siblings, which exploits a low-dimensional semantic space to modeling categories relations by translating operations in the semantic space. We take advantage of maximum weight matching problem on bipartite graphs to model taxonomy matching problem, which runs in polynomial time to generate optimal categories alignments for two taxonomies in a global manner. Experimental results on OAEI benchmark datasets show that our method significantly outperforms the baseline methods in taxonomy matching.},

abstract = {Stack Overflow is the largest Community-based Question Answering (CQA) site for software developers. Its popularity is mainly attributed to the timely answers provided by a great number of developers. When having problems in learning and using new technologies, developers resort to Stack Overflow for help. However, it is difficult to recommend questions to the potential answerers due to the huge numbers of questions. In order to improve the accuracy of question recommending, we need to find out the members who are interested in the fields related to the questions and match the ability of developers with the difficulty of questions. To do so, we need to pay close attention to the behavior of developers. This paper presents a model with two prediction approaches, namely, the traditional feature-based approach and LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) based approach. When a new question arrives, this model will use LDA method to label the question and indicate the proper category to which the question belongs according to latent semantic feature and content feature. Then, with the traditional features of the question and the asker information, the model will recommend the appropriate developers to answer this new question.},

The experimental data were collected from Zhihu.com, the most popular online social question \&amp; answer community in China. The results from a multiple linear regression model indicated that the effect of hosting live broadcasts on improving user popularity is the most significant. Moreover, answering questions, writing articles and asking questions also have a significant impact on users' popularity. But users' non-content contribution behavior, such as sharing content, and participation in live broadcasts has little effect on increasing user popularity. The findings can help guide users to adjust their behavior in the knowledge-sharing community to become more popular, thus promoting their continued contribution behavior. In addition, inspired by the research results, this paper recommends more effective knowledge service model of digital library.},

abstract = {This Research Full Paper presents a proposal for a pedagogical approach to be applied to educational robotics on a virtual distance learning platform, to foster teaching and learning, knowledge sharing and interaction between teachers and students. Recent studies indicate that 21st century students can master different skills and competencies to achieve success in their education, among which we highlight collaborative learning and educational robotics. One of the resources which successfully employ collaborative activities is groupware, which is a virtual collaborative system that supports groups of people with common tasks or objectives and enables the management of group activities. Many research works show that educational robotics has become an important facilitating and motivating tool for students entering Computer-focused courses. Literature has shown that both tools are important for the application of a STEM approach and have led to good results in an educational environment. To analyse the learning perceptions of educational robotics in a collaborative environment, we have developed a pedagogical approach that relies on collaborative learning through a groupware called IGARA, developed on Moodle platform. Activities made available by the virtual environment were developed based on constructivist, interactionist principles, with task contextualization to enhance students' perception. In order to assess the functionality of such an approach, an exploratory study was carried out with a set of 14 students, divided into 3 groups, spatially distant due to Covid-19 pandemic safety measures. Preliminary results were very promising and groupware was well accepted by participants.},

abstract = {We are delighted to welcome you to CQA 2012, the first Community Question Answering (CQA) workshop, under the umbrella of the WWW 2012 conference held in Lyon, France.Background: Despite the continuous progress of Web search engines in the last 20 years, many users' needs still remain unanswered. Two common reasons for queries not being satisfied are (1) the intent behind the query not being well expressed, and (2) the absence of relevant content. Subjective or narrow needs, for which content was not created before the need was expressed, will keep appearing no matter how Web search engines progress. This innate limitation of web search engines has led to the emergence of Community Question Answering (CQA) services in the last decade, such as Yahoo! Answers, Baidu Zhidao, Quora, Facebook Questions, and many topic-specific forums such as Stack Overflow. These services are designed to help users obtain information from a community, offering a wide variety of approaches (e.g., broadcasting the question to the whole community, just directed to friends, or specifically targeted to topic experts). Most importantly, these sites serve an active community of millions of users, and continue generating a great deal of popular Web content.Goals: While CQA services have been active for almost a decade, and are a popular subject of multiple research studies and publications in a variety of Web-related conferences, they have not, to the best of our knowledge, been a focus of a dedicated workshop in a top conference. The goal of this workshop was to bring together, for the first time, researchers and practitioners from various areas working on CQA. This workshop was specifically designed for the broad WWW audience. Yet, our goal was to also conduct a more focused discussion, and to consider the latest work in progress in the area of Community Question Answering.Process: We issued a call for papers and requested the assistance of a Program Committee of 11 renowned experts to carefully review the paper submissions. They are listed on the next page. We are deeply grateful to all of them for their thorough and insightful reviews.Themes: The themes of our workshop call for papers were diverse and included topics such as question routing, question recommendation, spam and abuse detection techniques, personalization and recommendation, user modeling, monetization, and connections of CQA with search, evaluation, and social network research. The papers that were accepted by our Program Committee could be clustered around 4 main areas: (1) quality (2) routing (3) discovery and (4) users. In addition, Sep Kamvar, Associate Professor of Media Arts and Sciences at MIT, and the Director of the Social Computing Group at the MIT Media Lab, agreed to open the workshop as our keynote speaker and discuss Language, Thought and Community Question Answering.We hope that you will find the workshop interesting and thought provoking. Our goal was not only to provide the opportunity for researchers and practitioners in the Web community to share ideas, but also to foster new research and innovation in the fascinating field of CQA.The Official Web site of the workshop is http://research.yahoo.com/workshops/cqa2012},

abstract = {Cluster-of-bandit policy leverages contextual bandits in a collaborative filtering manner and aids personalized services in the online recommendation system (RecSys). When facing insufficient observations, the cluster-of-bandit policy could achieve more outstanding performance because of knowledge sharing. Cluster-of-bandit policy aims to maximize the cumulative feedback, e.g., clicks, from users. Nevertheless, in the way of their goal exist two kinds of uncertainties. First, cluster-of-bandit algorithms make recommendations according to their uncertain estimation of user interests. Second, cluster-of-bandit algorithms transfer relevant knowledge upon uncertain and noisy user clusters. Existing algorithms only consider the first one, while leaving the latter one untouched. To address the two challenges together, in this paper, we propose the ClexB policy for online RecSys. On the one hand, ClexB estimates user clustering more accurately and with less uncertainty via explorable-clustering. On the other hand, ClexB also exploits and explores user interests by sharing information within and among user clusters. In summary, ClexB explores knowledge transfer and further aids the inferences about user interests. Besides, we provide extensive empirical experiments on both the synthetic and real-world datasets and regret analysis, further consolidating the superiority of ClexB.},

abstract = {Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are used in a wide variety of applications. However, as in any software application, DNN-based apps are afflicted with bugs. Previous work observed that DNN bug fix patterns are different from traditional bug fix patterns. Furthermore, those buggy models are non-trivial to diagnose and fix due to inexplicit errors with several options to fix them. To support developers in locating and fixing bugs, we propose DeepDiagnosis, a novel debugging approach that localizes the faults, reports error symptoms and suggests fixes for DNN programs. In the first phase, our technique monitors a training model, periodically checking for eight types of error conditions. Then, in case of problems, it reports messages containing sufficient information to perform actionable repairs to the model. In the evaluation, we thoroughly examine 444 models - 53 real-world from GitHub and Stack Overflow, and 391 curated by AUTOTRAINER. DeepDiagnosis provides superior accuracy when compared to UMLUAT and DeepLocalize. Our technique is faster than AUTOTRAINER for fault localization. The results show that our approach can support additional types of models, while state-of-the-art was only able to handle classification ones. Our technique was able to report bugs that do not manifest as numerical errors during training. Also, it can provide actionable insights for fix whereas DeepLocalize can only report faults that lead to numerical errors during training. DeepDiagnosis manifests the best capabilities of fault detection, bug localization, and symptoms identification when compared to other approaches.},

abstract = {Serverless computing is an emerging paradigm for cloud computing, gaining traction in a wide range of applications such as video processing and machine learning. This new paradigm allows developers to focus on the development of the logic of serverless computing based applications (abbreviated as serverless-based applications) in the granularity of function, thereby freeing developers from tedious and error-prone infrastructure management. Meanwhile, it also introduces new challenges on the design, implementation, and deployment of serverless-based applications, and current serverless computing platforms are far away from satisfactory. However, to the best of our knowledge, these challenges have not been well studied. To fill this knowledge gap, this paper presents the first comprehensive study on understanding the challenges in developing serverless-based applications from the developers’ perspective. We mine and analyze 22,731 relevant questions from Stack Overflow (a popular Q&amp;A website for developers), and show the increasing popularity trend and the high difficulty level of serverless computing for developers. Through manual inspection of 619 sampled questions, we construct a taxonomy of challenges that developers encounter, and report a series of findings and actionable implications. Stakeholders including application developers, researchers, and cloud providers can leverage these findings and implications to better understand and further explore the serverless computing paradigm.},

Even so, there is no consensus definition of the term 'CST' in HCI, and in most studies, CSTs have been construed as one-off exploratory prototypes, typically built by the researchers themselves. This makes it difficult to clearly demarcate CST research, but also to compare findings across studies, which impedes advancement in digital creativity as a growing field of research. Based on a literature review of 143 papers from the ACM Digital Library (1999-2018), we contribute a first overview of the key characteristics of CSTs developed by the HCI community. Moreover, we propose a tentative definition of a CST to help strengthen knowledge sharing across CST studies. We end by discussing our study's implications for future HCI research on CSTs and digital creativity.},

abstract = {Software development teams dedicate considerable resources to training newcomers. Newcomers are new developers to a software project. The software onboarding process is more complicated than onboarding into other organizations. It is much more challenging and time-consuming. The role of a mentor in onboarding newcomers in software engineering is well understood. However, the disruptions to the work of an experienced developer can reduce the quality of their work and job satisfaction. We propose a conversational bot that can help onboard newcomers to a software project instead of an experienced programmer. The bot will act as a mentor for the newcomer, thus putting less stress on experienced programmers. The bot will also be able to scan outside sources, such as stack overflow, for solutions to issues a newcomer may face. The newcomer will be able to interact with the bot using natural language. We will use this bot to assess improvements to code quality in future studies.},

From the perspective of management, these chat apps promised to foster greater communication and awareness between workers in the field, and between fieldworkers and the enterprises administration and management centres. Each organisation had multiple different types of chat groups, characterised by the types of content and interaction patterns they mediate, and the different organisational functions they fulfil. Examining the interplay between chat and existing local practices for coordination, collaboration and knowledge-sharing, we discuss how chat manifests in the distributed workplace and how it fits -- or otherwise -- alongside the rhythms of both local and remote work. We contribute to understandings of chat apps for workplace communication and provide insights for shaping their ongoing development.},

abstract = {Knowing developer expertise is critical for achieving effective task allocation. However, it is of great challenge to accurately profile the expertise of developers over the Internet as their activities often disperse across different online communities. In this regard, the existing works either merely concern a single community, or simply sum up the expertise in individual communities. The former suffers from low accuracy due to incomplete data, while the latter impractically assumes that developer expertise is completely independent and irrelavant across communities. To overcome those limitations, we propose a new approach to profile developer expertise across software communities through heterogeneous information network (HIN) analysis. A HIN is first built by analyzing the developer activities in various communities, where nodes represent objects like developers and skills, and edges represent the relations among objects. Second, as random walk with restart (RWR) is known for its ability to capture the global structure of the whole network, we adopt RWR over the HIN to estimate the proximity of developer nodes and skill nodes, which essentially reflects developer expertise. Based on the data of 72,645 common users of GitHub and Stack Overflow, we conducted an empirical study and evaluated developer expertise using proposed approach. To evaluate the effect of our approach, we use the obtained expertise to estimate the competency of developers in answering the questions posted in Stack Overflow. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our approach over existing methods.},

Open source software projects are becoming increasingly more popular. Many major companies have started building open source software. Unfortunately, many newcomers only commit once to an open source project before moving on to another project. Even worse, many novices struggle with joining open source communities and end up leaving quickly, sometimes before their first successful contribution. In this paper, we propose a conversational bot that would recommend projects to newcomers and assist in the onboarding to the open source community. The bot would be able to provide helpful resources, such as Stack Overflow related content. It would also be able to recommend human mentors. We believe that this bot would improve newcomers' experience by providing support not only during their first contribution, but by acting as an agent to engage them to the project.},

Although some previous studies have argued that knowledge sharing can be one potential way to support growth, other studies suggest that knowledge sharing is, in fact, a highly challenging task, even a problem, for a growing company. By drawing on previous studies on knowledge sharing barriers and different growth paths in the context of software business, this paper aims to increase our understanding of the knowledge sharing challenges that software companies may face in different growth paths.},

abstract = {This paper focuses on the problem of Question Routing (QR) in Community Question Answering (CQA), which aims to route newly posted questions to the potential answerers who are most likely to answer them. Traditional methods to solve this problem only consider the text similarity features between the newly posted question and the user profile, while ignoring the important statistical features, including the question-specific statistical feature and the user-specific statistical features. Moreover, traditional methods are based on unsupervised learning, which is not easy to introduce the rich features into them. This paper proposes a general framework based on the learning to rank concepts for QR. Training sets consist of triples (q, asker, answerers) are first collected. Then, by introducing the intrinsic relationships between the asker and the answerers in each CQA session to capture the intrinsic labels/orders of the users about their expertise degree of the question q, two different methods, including the SVM-based and RankingSVM-based methods, are presented to learn the models with different example creation processes from the training set. Finally, the potential answerers are ranked using the trained models. Extensive experiments conducted on a real world CQA dataset from Stack Overflow show that our proposed two methods can both outperform the traditional query likelihood language model (QLLM) as well as the state-of-the-art Latent Dirichlet Allocation based model (LDA). Specifically, the RankingSVM-based method achieves statistical significant improvements over the SVM-based method and has gained the best performance.},

This dataset helps researchers develop causal inference models towards solving two problems: (i) estimating the causal effects of aforementioned treatments on the outcome and (ii) finding the optimal treatment for the questions. Empirically, we performed experiments with three state-of-the-art causal effect estimation methods on the contributed dataset. In particular, we evaluated the optimal treatments recommended by the these approaches by comparing them with the ground truth labels – treatments (suggestions) provided by experts.},

abstract = {Social collaborative platforms such as GitHub and Stack Overflow have been increasingly used to improve work productivity via collaborative efforts. To improve user experiences in these platforms, it is desirable to have a recommender system that can suggest not only items (e.g., a GitHub repository) to a user, but also activities to be performed on the suggested items (e.g., forking a repository). To this end, we propose a new approach dubbed Keen2Act, which decomposes the recommendation problem into two stages: the Keen and Act steps. The Keen step identifies, for a given user, a (sub)set of items in which he/she is likely to be interested. The Act step then recommends to the user which activities to perform on the identified set of items. This decomposition provides a practical approach to tackling complex activity recommendation tasks while producing higher recommendation quality. We evaluate our proposed approach using two real-world datasets and obtain promising results whereby Keen2Act outperforms several baseline models.},

An exploratory study was conducted among healthcare professionals in India and Pakistan to assess their perceptions regarding knowledge management practices using mobile applications in their working environment. This cross-sectional qualitative study used semi-structured interviews with healthcare professionals in both India and Pakistan. The interviews were analyzed using a thematic analysis, which revealed three major themes. These themes being: Medical education and training, Collaboration between HCPs, and Patient health education. Findings indicate that the HCPs associated with mobile technologies in healthcare in India and Pakistan generally view it in a functional manner, rather than in an explicit manner. The mobile healthcare technologies in use are looked upon as an alternative solution for clinical purposes such as viewing diagnostic reports or providing initial information to the patients, and many more. The recognition of the idea of explicit and tacit knowledge is not usual among the HCPs. Therefore, the knowledge-sharing ability of mobile healthcare technologies is understood below par and often underutilized.},

This paper focuses on the domain of product research and development (R&amp;D), and aims to depict how AI can assist in industrial R&amp;D activities. Through a comprehensive review of literature, this paper identified three major drawbacks in traditional product R&amp;D approach, namely, low success rate, long research cycle, and difficulty in management. Subsequently, based on the characteristics of AI technology, this paper proposes and discusses a number of scenarios to demonstrate how AI can be applied to support R&amp;D activities. Comparing with traditional product R&amp;D, the advantages of AI-based R&amp;D are proposed and summarized: 1) More objective identification of user requirements to drive enterprise innovation; 2) more precise exploration of market trends; 3) higher efficiency in product design; 4) less risks in R&amp;D process; and 5) improved knowledge sharing ability. This paper will be of interests and value to practitioners and researchers concerned with AI usage in manufacturing contexts.},

We present similarities and differences between code clones in general and code clones on SO and point to open questions that need to be addressed to be able to make data-informed decisions about how to properly handle clones on this important platform. We present results from a first preliminary investigation, indicating that clones on SO are common and diverse. We further point to specific challenges, including incentives for users to clone successful answers and difficulties with bulk edits on the platform, and conclude with possible directions for future work.},

Yet, it still remains a mystery why error messages receive such bad reputations, especially given that they are merely very short pieces of natural language text. In this paper, we empirically demystify the causes and fixes of "bad" error messages, by qualitatively studying 201 Stack Overflow threads and 335 GitHub issues. We specifically focus on error messages encountered in data science development, which is an increasingly important but not well studied domain. We found that the causes of "bad" error messages are far more complicated than poor phrasing or flawed articulation of error message content. Many error messages are inherently and inevitably misleading or uninformative, since libraries do not know user intentions and cannot "see" external errors. Fixes to error-message-related issues mostly involve source code changes, while exclusive message content updates only take up a small portion. In addition, whether an error message is informative or helpful is not always clear-cut; even error messages that clearly pinpoint faults and resolutions can still cause confusion for certain users. These findings thus call for a more in-depth investigation on how error messages should be evaluated and improved in the future.},

It counts more than two millions of users who actively contribute by asking and answering thousands of questions daily. Identifying and reviewing low quality posts preserves the quality of site's contents and it is crucial to maintain a good user experience. In Stack Overflow the identification of poor quality posts is performed by selected users manually. The system also uses an automated identification system based on textual features. Low quality posts automatically enter a review queue maintained by experienced users. We present an approach to improve the automated system in use at Stack Overflow. It analyzes both the content of a post (e.g., simple textual features and complex readability metrics) and community-related aspects (e.g., popularity of a user in the community). Our approach reduces the size of the review queue effectively and removes misclassified good quality posts.},

abstract = {Public Procurement is a heavily regulated process, particularly its competitive tendering phase. Besides, public procurers like states and municipalities are large and complex organization environments guided by administrative regulation. Thus, in public procurement contracting, even more challenges in knowledge sharing are faced than in "normal" contracting which is a demanding cross-professional collaboration in itself. We have simulated municipal public procurement processes which have revealed a need to balance the prevailing legal attitude with design attitude. Using design tools, such as visualization of organizational processes and contracting documents, can facilitate efforts towards better collaboration and procurement success by revealing challenges in knowledge sharing and developing the legally oriented documents into knowledge sharing tools.},

abstract = {Past investigations have recorded the utilisation of administrative claim data for medical care research purposes. Also, administrative claim data uncovers massive professional networks among medical services providers, such as information and knowledge sharing. During care for patients, the connection among providers makes a considerable commitment to efficient health results. Patient-sharing provider networks (PSN) as a joint effort are new and analysed to investigate their effect on medical services results; the impact of such collaborative efforts is yet unidentified. This study aims to analyse PSN for different suburbs of the Macarthur region in New South Wales (NSW), Australia and explore health care collaboration between patients and providers. It has illustrated the usefulness of analysing this network and its applications in studying the collaborative efforts of patients and different healthcare service providers. It also has discussed patient satisfaction as it is one of the several ways to evaluate health service quality, composing an effective indicator to measure providers' success. In this context, determining the main factors contributing to patient satisfaction is crucial to improving quality in healthcare delivery. The corresponding literature suggests that socio-demographic characteristics play a vital role in patient satisfaction. Therefore, based on the social network analysis methodology, this paper measures the connections between gender, age, family status, level of education, incomes, living quality, and patient satisfaction in the Macarthur region. The findings and insights from this research can potentially help healthcare stakeholders formulate better policies, eventually improving the quality of care. The analyses conducted in this study illustrate the potential for using network analysis to provide new insights into the Australian healthcare system and opportunities for prompting future improvements.},

abstract = {Insecure code leading to software vulnerabilities can result in damages of the order of millions of dollars, and in critical systems, the loss of life. Hence, developing secure systems free of exploitable vulnerabilities has been a thrust area of research in recent years. Understanding developers’ approach towards vulnerabilities in their code can pave the way for improvements in insecure coding practices. Recent studies have explored online Q&amp;A forums, open-source code repositories, and other code information sources to gain important insights into the pervasiveness of security vulnerabilities. However, to the best of our knowledge, competitive programming (CP) data, a rich source of information about coding practices, has not been explored from the perspective of insecure coding practices. The evaluation and assessment of coding practices used in CP is particularly intriguing because it has become a key player in developer recruitment in recent times. In this paper, we make one of the first attempts to draw the attention of the community to the emergent concern of insecure coding practices in CP. We use static analysis tools to identify the prevalence and nature of vulnerabilities in a large amount of CP data (6.1 million submissions) obtained from a top-rated CP platform, CodeChef, and find that 34.2\% of submissions contain vulnerabilities. We observe that many programmers consistently follow insecure coding practices and most of the detected vulnerabilities are characterized by security standards (CWE, CVSS) based on real-world software.},

abstract = {Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) is an approach that considers models as first-class entities used in the software analysis, design and implementation. Although MDE has become popular in both academia and industry as an alternative for tackling the growing complexity of modern software, MDE has not been largely adopted in the software development process. A possible way to mitigate those problems consists of understanding how MDE has been applied in practice and what are the main barriers found by developers. Hence, this paper presents an exploratory study to analyse the discussions about MDE from two Q&amp;A platforms: Stack Overflow and Software Engineering Stack Exchange. One hundred fourteen discussions have been analysed under four perspectives: discussion type, application domain, tools, and developer interest. As a result, we identified that 69, 30\% of the discussions regard technical aspects, from which metamodelling is the most discussed topic, and Xtext is the most discussed tool. In addition, we observed that discussions in which developers suggest MDE-related tools tend to attract more views and answers.},

abstract = {Global Software Development has brought many benefits to the industry. On the other hand, it carries with it new challenges mostly regarding knowledge transfer. When new hires join a company, they should learn about the working process, organization structure and company corporate culture. Therefore, companies should be adopting strategies to manage and transfer knowledge to better support newcomers as well as to hire new members to increase the developer team due to massive demand. As we work in GSD scope, we use Wiki as an alternative for sharing knowledge and for helping newcomers learn about our software development process. However, newer members reported great difficulty during Wiki usage, due to a large amount of information, lack of information process and non-structural knowledge sharing. For this reason, we surveyed to understand which difficulties newer PLs members faced during wiki usage at Sidia R&amp;D Institute. The results show important contributions to understand how their learning work process, difficulties to access wiki information caused by usability issues and knowledge management adequate. Despite it, one important finding is that Wiki did informal aid learning, but there is still plenty of room for improvement.},

Although live streams for entertainment are the most popular kind, there are also knowledge sharing live streams (KSLS).

The objective of this work is to make a diagnosis through an online questionnaire with the public of an Embrapa broadcast, identifying their profile and preferences, as well as possibilities for improvements in KSLS. This study's research questions are: Has the live stream proved to be an efficient tool for sharing knowledge? What are the user's preferences? Is it possible to improve their experience? Our results indicate that live streams have great potential for sharing knowledge. In accordance with current studies, we have recognized that great effort is needed to engage the public and there are opportunities to design and develop resources to improve the broadcast environment. In particular, users who participated in our study were interested in annotations and screen recording tools, surveys to influence the offered content, and interactions through multiple-choice questions. We also present some lessons learned regarding preferences, habits, and characteristics of the users.},

abstract = {In an ideal world, automated tools and systems could manage security and privacy seamlessly and transparently with minimal human input. In the real world, we are nowhere close to that ideal. Instead, in order to achieve good security and privacy outcomes, people need to absorb and apply high-quality security and privacy information and advice. This applies not only to end users, but also to software developers, product managers, and even security operations professionals.Sadly, the current state of the security advice and information ecosystem is in many respects a disaster. End users often get their advice from TV shows, movies, and even misleading influencer ads [2, 4], while soft ware developers take unvetted suggestions from Stack Overflow [1, 3]. Even compliance standards -- which are designed to provide authoritative security guidance -- have numerous problems [6, 7]. Our review of security advice on the web found 374 unique advice imperatives, many of which directly contradict one another [5].This sad state of affairs is, in many ways, our fault. Security experts, like the ones who attend conferences such as CCS, often refuse to prioritize, recommending maximum security without tailoring to specific situations. Researchers evaluate tools and techniques in idealized rather than realistic use contexts, and have made little progress in accurately measuring the costs and benefits of any particular intervention.In this talk, I will review the many problems of the security and privacy information and advice ecosystem, and how we got here. I'll outline our responsibility, as experts and researchers, to help improve the quality, availability, and usability of security and privacy information. Finally, I'll discuss at what we know (and what we need to find out) about how to make progress.},

Unfortunately, plain text does not capture the structural qualities of these snippets; for example, snippets frequently refer to specific API (e.g., Android), but by treating the snippets as text, linkage to the Android API is not always apparent. We perform snippet analysis to extract structural information from short plain-text snippets that are often found in Stack Overflow. This analysis is able to identify 253,137 method calls and type references from 21,250 Stack Overflow code snippets. We show how identifying these structural relationships from snippets could perform better than lexical search over code blocks in practice.},

abstract = {Conventionally, callbacks and inversion of control have been the main tools to structure event-driven applications. Sadly, those patterns constitute a well-known source of design problems. The Reactive Programming (RP) paradigm has arisen as an approach to mitigate these problems. Yet, little evidence has been provided regarding the advantages of RP, and concerns have also arisen about the API usability of RP libraries given their disparate number of operators. In this work, we conduct a study on GitHub (GH) and Stack Overflow (SO) and explore three Reactive Extensions (Rx) libraries (RxJava, RxJS, and RxSwift) with the most GH projects to understand how much the vast Rx operators are being used. Also, we examine Rx SO posts to complement the results from the GH exploration by understanding the problems faced by RP developers and how they relate with the operators' frequencies found in open source projects. Results reveal that, in spite of its API size, the great majority of the Rx operators are actually being used (95.2\%), with only a few, mostly related to RxJava, not being utilized. Also, we unveil 23 topics from SO with more posts concerning the Stream Abstraction (36.4\%). Posts related to Dependency Management, Introductory Questions, and iOS Development figure as relevant topics to the community. The findings herein present can not only stimulate advancements in the field by understanding the usage of RP API and the main problems faced by developers, but also help newcomers in identifying the most important operators and the areas that are the most likely to be relevant for a RP application.},

abstract = {Recently, the world economy has been quietly transformed from the Industry economy time to the knowledge economy time. The effective knowledge Management innovation method causes knowledge to become the first Propelling force of economy. And it impels the enterprises to grow continually which brings them to succeed in the intense market Competition. Therefore as one of the unique but also infinite resource the knowledge has already become the core essential factor of the Economic development. Moreover looks over the new world economy especially the European and American economies development histories we may discover that the Industry Clusters has Played the extremely Role to the development of their economy. This paper mainly discusses the characteristics of knowledge management and knowledge sharing in industry clusters, structure of knowledge sharing in industry cluster, then gives an evaluation about knowledge sharing process. Knowledge sharing evaluation services to enable enterprises to know your role in the cluster, as well as for the enterprises within the cluster to better share the knowledge relevant enterprises to provide reference and basis.},

abstract = {Knowledge is a valuable asset for businesses that have to be managed by storing and sharing it in a knowledge management system. Managing knowledge is purposed to standardized knowledge shared through training. PT. XYZ is a system integrator company that wants to do a roadshow and initiate robotics training across Indonesia by utilizing an educational robotic arm. However, they need a platform to manage knowledge. This paper dealt with knowledge management systems in form of e-learning development to standardize and support knowledge sharing effectively and efficiently. Analysis, Design, Development, Implementation, and Evaluation (ADDIE) model and prototyping-based methodology were used to develop the e-learning. Various contents were developed based on a structured curriculum. The e-learning configuration was done in four prototyping cycles to understand and satisfy user needs for e-learning. E-Learning developed consisted of four courses and various learning media and features considering learning styles and human factors. The e-learning was evaluated through the user acceptance test with the Evaluating E-learning systems success (EESS) survey model. The results showed that users are satisfied with the e-learning that provides various media, understandable and clear information, and remarkable system and service performance so it can be implemented to facilitate knowledge transfer to students effectively and efficiently.},

abstract = {Question answering (Q&amp;A) websites are now large repositories of valuable knowledge. While most Q&amp;A sites were initially aimed at providing useful answers to the question asker, there has been a marked shift towards question answering as a community-driven knowledge creation process whose end product can be of enduring value to a broad audience. As part of this shift, specific expertise and deep knowledge of the subject at hand have become increasingly important, and many Q&amp;A sites employ voting and reputation mechanisms as centerpieces of their design to help users identify the trustworthiness and accuracy of the content.To better understand this shift in focus from one-off answers to a group knowledge-creation process, we consider a question together with its entire set of corresponding answers as our fundamental unit of analysis, in contrast with the focus on individual question-answer pairs that characterized previous work. Our investigation considers the dynamics of the community activity that shapes the set of answers, both how answers and voters arrive over time and how this influences the eventual outcome. For example, we observe significant assortativity in the reputations of co-answerers, relationships between reputation and answer speed, and that the probability of an answer being chosen as the best one strongly depends on temporal characteristics of answer arrivals. We then show that our understanding of such properties is naturally applicable to predicting several important quantities, including the long-term value of the question and its answers, as well as whether a question requires a better answer. Finally, we discuss the implications of these results for the design of Q&amp;A sites.},

We analyze the resulting layers of three terrorist datasets and present explanations of why three layers should be used for these models. We also use the information of just one layer, to identify the Bali 2005 attack community.},

abstract = {Incentives to encourage knowledge sharing have received considerable attention from the research community. However, consensus on the influence of incentives on sharing levels and what are the critical success factors is yet to emerge. This causes challenges for both knowledge management researchers and practitioners, as the effects of incentive systems cannot be predicted consistently. Hence, this article aims to discuss the critical factors for creating incentive systems to encourage sharing. To improve the prediction accuracy for such systems, a new framework is proposed. The proposed framework is a combination of sociological and economical approaches, which covers both the influence incentives and the relational factors that govern the behaviour of individuals in any given relationship. Analysis of a case study base on the proposed framework is then compared to two alternative frameworks approaches to incentive design. The comparison between the predictions made by the three theories shows that the prediction power and that the critical factors for designing incentives varies significantly. Therefore, when managers design new incentive structures to encourage knowledge sharing, they need to consider which theory captures their hidden assumptions and the presented situation's foundations most accurately. Finally future research directions are suggested based on the predictions made with the framework are proposed.},

Approaches which use standalone encoded representations for each of the questions in the question pair fail to use the cross question interactions between the two questions which impacts their performance adversely. In this paper, we propose two new schemes for DQD task. Our first approach leverages semantic relations and our second approach utilizes fine grained word level interactions across the two question sentences. We achieve test accuracy of 75.7\% and 77.8\% with our first and second approaches respectively on a publicly available DQD data set, demonstrating that cross question analysis information can help aid DQD task performance.},

abstract = {With the increasing complexity of software, it becomes even more important to build on the work of others. At the same time, websites, such as Stack Overflow or GitHub, are used by millions of developers to host their code, which could potentially be reused.  The process of finding the right code, however, is often time-consuming. In addition, the right solution may be written in a programming language that does not fit the developer's requirements. Current approaches to automate code search allow users to search for code based on keywords and transformation rules, but they are limited to one programming language.  Our approach enables developers to find code for reuse written in different languages, which is especially useful when building polyglot applications. In addition to conventional search filters, users can filter code by providing example input and expected output. Based on our approach, we have implemented a tool prototype in GraalSqueak. We evaluate both approach and prototype with an experience report.},

However, integrating Fab Lab environments into academic education is still challenging in practice. In Germany, more than 200 such creative community spaces exist [5]; around 15 of these are associated with universities. Most are initiated and run by single entities such as student groups or university chairs and are not integrated in the universities' overall organizational matters. The federal research project 'FAB101' aims to consolidate organizational and educational knowledge based on experiences in four Fab Labs at German universities [9].

Furthermore, we verify the attitude toward KS to understand its mediate effect in the model. Knowledge sharing is an emergent trend in real business practices. This study is catering to this trend and attempts to build a model capturing the dynamic of team collaboration and its consequences on intention to knowledge sharing.

We describe a similarity scheme for these elements and demonstrate how structural information can be extracted from source code snippets and compared to further improve the retrieval of questions. The results of our evaluation indicate that our methodology is effective on recommending similar question posts allowing community members to search without fully forming a question.},

However, since gender is not explicitly recorded, it is typically inferred by automatic "gender guessers", based on cues derived from an individual's online presence, such as their name and profile picture. As opposed to self-reporting, used in earlier studies, gender guessers scale better, but their accuracy depends on the quantity and quality of data available in one's online profile.In this paper we evaluate the applicability of different gender guessing approaches on several datasets derived from Stack Overflow. Our results suggest that the approaches combining different data sources perform the best.},

abstract = {The network of scholarly publishing involves generating and exchanging ideas, certifying research, publishing in order to disseminate findings, and preserving outputs. Despite enormous efforts in providing support for each of those steps in scholarly communication, identifying knowledge fragments is still a big challenge. This is due to the heterogeneous nature of the scholarly data and the current paradigm of distribution by publishing (mostly document-based) over journal articles, numerous repositories, and libraries. Therefore, transforming this paradigm to knowledge-based representation is expected to reform the knowledge sharing in the scholarly world. Although many movements have been initiated in recent years, non-technical scientific communities suffer from transforming document-based publishing to knowledge-based publishing. In this paper, we present a model (PharmSci) for scholarly publishing in the pharmaceutical research domain with the goal of facilitating knowledge discovery through effective ontology-based data integration. PharmSci provides machine-interpretable information to the knowledge discovery process. The principles and guidelines of the ontological engineering have been followed. Reasoning-based techniques are also presented in the design of the ontology to improve the quality of targeted tasks for data integration. The developed ontology is evaluated with a validation process and also a quality verification method.},

Our research tackles software security issues from a knowledge management perspective. In this paper, we present an ontology approach to model the knowledge of software security in a context- sensitive manner, supporting software engineers and learners to enable the correlation process between security domain knowledge and their working context.

abstract = {Developers are concerned with the comparison of similar APIs in terms of their commonalities and (often subtle) differences. Our empirical study of Stack Overflow questions and API documentation confirms that API comparison questions are common and can often be answered by knowledge contained in API reference documentation. Our study also identifies eight types of API statements that are useful for API comparison. Based on these findings, we propose a knowledge graph based approach APIComp that automatically extracts API knowledge from API reference documentation to support the comparison of a pair of API classes or methods from different aspects. Our approach includes an offline phase for constructing an API knowledge graph, and an online phase for generating an API comparison result for a given pair of API elements. Our evaluation shows that the quality of different kinds of extracted knowledge in the API knowledge graph is generally high. Furthermore, the comparison results generated by APIComp are significantly better than those generated by a baseline approach based on heuristic rules and text similarity, and our generated API comparison results are useful for helping developers in API selection tasks.},

abstract = {Community Question Answering (cQA) services, such as Yahoo! Answers and MSN QnA, facilitate knowledge sharing through question answering by an online community of users. These services include incentive mechanisms to entice participation and self-regulate the quality of the content contributed by the users. In order to encourage quality contributions, community members are asked to nominate the ‘best’ among the answers provided to a question. The service then awards extra points to the author who provided the winning answer and to the voters who cast their vote for that answer. The best answers are typically selected by plurality voting, a scheme that is simple, yet vulnerable to random voting and collusion. We propose a weighted voting method that incorporates information about the voters’ behavior. It assigns a score to each voter that captures the level of agreement with other voters. It uses the voter scores to aggregate the votes and determine the best answer. The mathematical formulation leads to the application of the Brouwer Fixed Point Theorem which guarantees the existence of a voter scoring function that satisfies the starting axiom. We demonstrate the robustness of our approach through simulations and analysis of real cQA service data.},

Recent finding has suggested that developers fail to choose the right search keywords from an issue report for 88\% of times. Thus, despite a number of earlier studies, automatic reformulation of queries for the code search is an open problem which warrants further investigations. In this dissertation work, we hypothesize that code search could be improved by adopting appropriate term weighting, context-awareness and data-analytics in query reformulation. We ask three research questions to evaluate the hypothesis, and then conduct six studies to answer these questions. Our proposed approaches improve code search by incorporating (1) novel, appropriate keyword selection algorithms, (2) context-awareness, (3) crowdsourced knowledge from Stack Overflow, and (4) large-scale data analytics into the query reformulation process.},

Tagging this mixed text is essential for making progress on two seminal software engineering problems --- traceability, and reuse via precise extraction of code snippets from mixed text. In this paper, we borrow code-switching techniques from Natural Language Processing and adapt them to apply to mixed text to solve two problems: language identification and token tagging. Our technique, POSIT, simultaneously provides abstract syntax tree tags for source code tokens, part-of-speech tags for natural language words, and predicts the source language of a token in mixed text. To realize POSIT, we trained a biLSTM network with a Conditional Random Field output layer using abstract syntax tree tags from the CLANG compiler and part-of-speech tags from the Standard Stanford part-of-speech tagger. POSIT improves the state-of-the-art on language identification by 10.6\% and PoS/AST tagging by 23.7\% in accuracy.},

However, they lack sufficient reliability to be the sole basis of customer service applications.

A user experiment found that our tool reduced the participants' cognitive load and improved their performance, in terms of their precision and recall. In particular, those with higher performance benefited more than those with lower performance.},

abstract = {Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) are designed to help developers build software more effectively. Recommending the right APIs for specific tasks is gaining increasing attention among researchers and developers.  
However, most of the existing approaches are mainly evaluated for general programming tasks using statically typed programming languages such as Java. Little is known about their practical effectiveness and usefulness for machine learning (ML) programming tasks with dynamically typed programming languages such as Python, whose paradigms are fundamentally different from general programming tasks. This is of great value considering the increasing popularity of ML and the large number of new questions appearing on question answering websites.  
In this work, we set out to investigate the effectiveness of existing API recommendation approaches for Python-based ML programming tasks from Stack Overflow (SO). Specifically, we conducted an empirical study of six widely-used Python-based ML libraries using two state-of-the-art API recommendation approaches, i.e., BIKER and DeepAPI. We found that the existing approaches perform poorly for two main reasons: (1) Python-based ML tasks often require significant long API sequences; and (2) there are common API usage patterns in Python-based ML programming tasks that existing approaches cannot handle.  
Inspired by our findings, we proposed a simple but effective frequent itemset mining-based approach, i.e., FIMAX, to boost API recommendation approaches, i.e., enhance existing API recommendation approaches for Python-based ML programming tasks by leveraging the common API usage information from SO questions. Our evaluation shows that FIMAX improves existing state-of-the-art API recommendation approaches by up to 54.3\% and 57.4\% in MRR and MAP, respectively. Our user study with 14 developers further demonstrates the practicality of FIMAX for API recommendation.},

abstract = {Gamification has gained scientific attention as a motivational tool for behavior change in various contexts. When designing gamification, several scholars emphasize the importance of tailoring content to the needs of different users, e.g. by using the gamification user types HEXAD typology. From a theoretical point of view, researchers suggest correlations between HEXAD types and certain game elements, but empirical validation of these assumptions is still lacking. Previous studies show limitations either in terms of sample size or comprehensiveness of analysis. Therefore, this study aims to empirically identify game element preferences of different HEXAD types and to validate both the English and a corresponding German version of the HEXAD scale in a quantitative study design with 1,073 participants. The validation shows that the HEXAD scale is a valuable tool for identifying HEXAD types, with some improvements needed for a better model fit. Correlation analysis shows highly significant correlations between HEXAD types and specific game elements. While Philanthropists are motivated by gifting, administrative roles, and knowledge sharing, Free Spirits prefer creativity tools, exploratory tasks, and learning. Both Achievers and Players like challenges, leaderboards, levels, and competition, but Players are additionally attracted by extrinsic elements such as achievements, points, and rewards. Socializers like social elements, i.e., teams, social discovery, and social networks. Finally, Disruptors like anarchic gameplay and innovation platforms. In general, the results suggest that the HEXAD typology provides helpful and validated guidance for tailored gamification, and our findings should successfully drive future gamification design to maximize the desired behavioral outcome.},

In this paper we present an approach for identifying emerging topics and issues in Data Science by using Question and Answer (Q&amp;A) sites as a resource. Q&amp;A sites provide a useful online platform for discussion of topics and through the sharing of information they become a valuable corpus of knowledge. We applied latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), a statistical topic modeling technique, to analyze data science related threads from from two popular Q&amp;A communities "Stack Exchange and Reddit". We uncovered both important topics as well as useful examples that can be incorporated into teaching. In addition to technical topics, our analysis also identified topics related to professional development. We believe that approaches such as these are critical in order to update curriculum and bridge the workplace-school divide in teaching of newer topics such as data science. Given the pace of technical development and frequent changes in the field, this is an inventive and effective method to keep teaching up to date. We also discuss the limitations of this approach whereby topics of importance such as data ethics are largely missing from online discussions.},

abstract = {Neurosurgeons accumulate a variety of empirical knowledge through surgeries. Post-operative reports, incident reports, and accident reports are effective means of recording and sharing empirical knowledge, but they are costly to analyze them, and new methods of sharing knowledge are needed. In addition, the interface using CG technology, which is used in surgical planning, is actively used as a means for doctors to easily obtain information, but it is not widely used for knowledge sharing. In this research, we aim to build a knowledge base to convey and utilize physicians’ know-how, which is difficult to convey, by accurately expressing empirical knowledge using CG technology. One of the challenges in sharing empirical knowledge is the difficulty of handling medical information from the viewpoint of personal information protection. Medical information is data that can easily identify individuals and that has a very high importance of rare data. Therefore, we examined the environment for using medical information and appropriate anonymization. First, we proposed a method for constructing an ontology for neurosurgery based on the medical ontology that has been studied in the medical field by organizing the structure of empirical knowledge of doctors. In addition, we designed and fabricated a prototype interface using 3D models as a system for data input and search display.

The overall purpose of this research is to gain a better understanding of user motivation to view different livestreaming content in China. Therefore, this study adopts affective, cognitive, personal integrative, social integrative, and tension release to study the reasons behind this impulse. An analysis of 416 valid participants was established through the online questionnaire responded to by Chinese livestreaming users analyzed by linear regression. The results of this research indicated that Chinese audiences had different motivations for watching Esports, entertainment, knowledge-sharing, and E-commerce livestreams. The main reason Chinese audiences watch livestreams is that watching livestreaming can bring them joyfulness, self-pleasure, cognitive satisfaction, and pressure release, while social needs can explain more of audiences’ emotional engagements. Furthermore, this study also explored the motivations behind audiences’ deeper engagements. This study also represents an attempt to quantify unexplored differences in various livestreaming contents’ perceptions of viewer motivations in China, which not only can offer the hint to the livestreaming industry and company but also influence the audiences and streamers in China. This research is among the first to explore the various livestreaming users’ motivations based on motivational factors in China.},

We then propose a prediction model by employing five metrics related to user behaviour, topics and popularity of question, which predicts if the best answer for a question at Stack Overflow might remain unaccepted or not. Experiments using 8,057 questions show that the model can predict unresolved questions with 78.70\% precision and 76.10\% recall.},

In spite of the importance of social networks, there is comparatively little theory-driven empirical research that has been published to address this new type of communication and interaction phenomena. In this research, we explore the factors which motivate people to participate actively in social collaboration. We conceptualized that use of social collaboration is an intentional social action where people willing to share their knowledge, experience and expertise. We examine the relative impact of We-Intention, moral trust and self-motivation to participate in social collaboration and knowledge sharing activity.

abstract = {The hyponym-hypernym relation is an essential element in the semantic network. Identifying the hypernym from a definition is an important task in natural language processing and semantic analysis. While a public dictionary such as WordNet works for common words, its application in domain-specific scenarios is limited. Existing tools for hypernym extraction either rely on specific semantic patterns or focus on the word representation, which all demonstrate certain limitations. Here we propose a method by combining both the syntactic structure in definitions given by the word’s part of speech, and the bidirectional gated recurrent unit network as the learning kernel. The output can be further tuned by including other features such as a word’s centrality in the hypernym co-occurrence network. The method is tested in the corpus from Wikipedia featuring definition with high regularity, and the corpus from Stack-Overflow whose definition is usually irregular. It shows enhanced performance compared with other tools in both corpora. Taken together, our work not only provides a useful tool for hypernym extraction but also gives an example of utilizing syntactic structures to learn semantic relationships (Source code and data available at ).},

Recently Partitioned Shadow Volumes (PSV) has been introduced. It revisits the old Shadow Volumes Binary Tree Space Partitioning algorithm, leading to a practicable and efficient technique. In this article, we analyze the PSV query algorithm and identify two main drawbacks: First, it uses a stack which is not GPU friendly; its size must be small enough to reduce the register pressure, but large enough to avoid stack overflow. Second, PSV struggles with configurations involving significant depth complexity, especially for lit points. We solve these problems by adding a depth information to the PSV data structure, and by designing a stackless query. In addition, we show how to combine the former PSV query with our stackless solution, leading to a hybrid technique taking advantage of both. This eliminates any risk of stack overflow, and our experiments demonstrate that these improvements accelerate the rendering time up to a factor of 3.},

abstract = {While current information retrieval systems are effective for known-item retrieval where the searcher provides a precise name or identifier for the item being sought, systems tend to be much less effective for cases where the searcher is unable to express a precise name or identifier. We refer to this as tip of the tongue (TOT) known-item retrieval, named after the cognitive state of not being able to retrieve an item from memory. Using movie search as a case study, we explore the characteristics of questions posed by searchers in TOT states in a community question answering website. We analyze how searchers express their information needs during TOT states in the movie domain. Specifically, what information do searchers remember about the item being sought and how do they convey this information? Our results suggest that searchers use a combination of information about: (1) the content of the item sought, (2) the context in which they previously engaged with the item, and (3) previous attempts to find the item using other resources (e.g., search engines). Additionally, searchers convey information by sometimes expressing uncertainty (i.e., hedging), opinions, emotions, and by performing relative (vs. absolute) comparisons with attributes of the item. As a result of our analysis, we believe that searchers in TOT states may require specialized query understanding methods or document representations. Finally, our preliminary retrieval experiments show the impact of each information type presented in information requests on retrieval performance.},

It can also be compared based on Ecology to a disruption of the "food chain" that can turn a dynamic ecosystem in a static or dead ecosystem. For example, Microsoft announced in 2017 that Windows Phone would no longer push any updates and became only focusing on maintenance. We want to contribute in understanding how, why and when a SECO is turning on static (i.e., dying) and the "post mortem" status of a SECO. We initially study the Windows Phone from 46,030 questions in Stack Overflow to understand what happens to a SECO when the core platform is discontinued. From our result analysis we perceived that it can be useful to understanding the "vital signals" of ecosystem collapse, migratory/survival patterns, technical resource recycling and the energy transfer among individuals, populations, communities and SECOs. We also contributes with 14 insights.},

This study is to examine the impact of several key factors that may affect knowledge sharing within project teams in China. By surveying managerial employees from different project teams in the construction sector, this study shows that both intrinsically and extrinsically motivated individuals tend to share more knowledge with their team members. Individuals with high altruism are also more likely to share knowledge with others. Moreover, explicit knowledge facilitates knowledge sharing while tacit knowledge creates barriers to knowledge sharing. The implications to knowledge management research and practice are also considered in this study.},

What remains unknown is whether this is due to a few people contributing a lot, or whether highly represented countries have a higher percentage of users who are willing to contribute. In this paper, we investigate this question with the goal of identifying opportunities to equalize contributions between countries. Analyzing the data from StackOverflow and Superuser, two popular Q&amp;A sites, we find that the percentage of contributing users significantly varies between 116 countries, and that these differences can be partly explained by a country's national culture and overall English proficiency. We discuss how specific design decisions on these sites, such as the competitive reward mechanism used to encourage contributions, could be changed to encourage currently passive people to contribute.},

Knowledge sharing behavior between exchange students and native students is of great importance for knowledge innovation, international friendship enhancement, the understanding of cultural differences, and the abandonment of prejudices. The theory of planned behavior (TPB), which is generally accepted in the study of human behavior, is used in this paper. Based on TPB, this paper constructed a concrete model of the elements which influence the knowledge sharing behavior between the exchange and the native students. This TPB-based model helped to propose several measures from four aspects to promote the knowledge sharing behavior discussed in this paper.},

The posts' questions and titles are pre-processed, and the sentences in the posts are further transformed into features via Latent Dirichlet Allocation. The problem is a multi-class and multi-label classification and hence, we propose 1) one-against-all models for 15 most popularly used tags, and 2) a combined multi-tag classifier for finding the top K tags for a single post. Three algorithms are used to train the one-against-all classifiers to decide to what extent a post belongs to a tag. The probabilities of each post belonging to a tag are then combined to give the results of the multi-tag classifier with the best performing algorithm. The performance is compared with a baseline approach (kNN). Our multi-tag classifier achieves 55\% recall and 39\% F1-score.},

In this paper, we propose COALA, an answer selection approach that (a) selects appropriate long answers due to an effective comparison of all question-answer aspects, (b) has the ability to generalize from a small number of training examples, and (c) makes use of the information about syntactic roles of words. We show that our approach outperforms existing answer selection models by a large margin on six cQA datasets from different domains. Furthermore, we report the best results on the passage retrieval benchmark WikiPassageQA.},

We operationalize these attributes using common metrics and apply statistical modeling to empirically quantify and validate the strength of these signals. Our results are based on a rich dataset of 3,831,147 users and their activities spanning nearly a decade since the site's inception in 2008. We present evidence that certain non-trivial badges, reputation scores and age of the user on the site positively correlate with popularity and impact. Further, we find that the presence of costly to earn and hard to observe signals qualitatively differentiates highly impactful users from highly popular users.},

year = {2016},
publisher = {AAAI Press},
abstract = {As more and more multilingual knowledge becomes available on the Web, knowledge sharing across languages has become an important task to benefit many applications. One of the most crucial kinds of knowledge on the Web is taxonomy, which is used to organize and classify the Web data. To facilitate knowledge sharing across languages, we need to deal with the problem of cross-lingual taxonomy alignment, which discovers the most relevant category in the target taxonomy of one language for each category in the source taxonomy of another language. Current approaches for aligning cross-lingual taxonomies strongly rely on domain-specific information and the features based on string similarities. In this paper, we present a new approach to deal with the problem of cross-lingual taxonomy alignment without using any domain-specific information. We first identify the candidate matched categories in the target taxonomy for each category in the source taxonomy using the cross-lingual string similarity. We then propose a novel bilingual topic model, called Bilingual Biterm Topic Model (BiBTM), to perform exact matching. BiBTM is trained by the textual contexts extracted from the Web. We conduct experiments on two kinds of real world datasets. The experimental results show that our approach significantly outperforms the designed state-of-the-art comparison methods.},

abstract = {Informal discussions on social platforms (e.g., Stack Overflow) accumulates a large body of programming knowledge in natural language text. Natural language process (NLP) techniques can be exploited to harvest this knowledge base for software engineering tasks. To make an effective use of NLP techniques, consistent vocabulary is essential. Unfortunately, the same concepts are often intentionally or accidentally mentioned in many different morphological forms in informal discussions, such as abbreviations, synonyms and misspellings. Existing techniques to deal with such morphological forms are either designed for general English or predominantly rely on domain-specific lexical rules. A thesaurus of software-specific terms and commonly-used morphological forms is desirable for normalizing software engineering text, but very difficult to build manually. In this work, we propose an automatic approach to build such a thesaurus. Our approach identifies software-specific terms by contrasting software-specific and general corpuses, and infers morphological forms of software-specific terms by combining distributed word semantics, domain-specific lexical rules and transformations, and graph analysis of morphological relations. We evaluate the coverage and accuracy of the resulting thesaurus against community-curated lists of software-specific terms, abbreviations and synonyms. We also manually examine the correctness of the identified abbreviations and synonyms in our thesaurus. We demonstrate the usefulness of our thesaurus in a case study of normalizing questions from Stack Overflow and CodeProject.},

The knowledge-sharing process of inquiry learning tends to be complex. Therefore, we propose using location-based augmented reality (AR) to immerse students in the inquiry learning process. Mobile devices were used to immediately record and observe objects and enable learners to communicate with each other and engage in discussions, which raises their level of knowledge. The process of inquiry learning entails five steps: asking a question, attempting to answer the question, stimulating creative concepts, multiple people discussing the topic, and lastly, reaching a conclusion based on discourse and discovering an in-depth question from the conclusion, resulting in a new inquiry cycle. Therefore, to better understand learner behaviours in online knowledge-sharing discussions using location-based AR, we used an interaction analysis model to explore knowledge discussion behaviours among multiple participants to understand whether location-based AR helps students achieve higher phases of knowledge construction.},

abstract = {It is poorly understood how developers discover and adopt software development innovations such as tools, libraries, frameworks, or web sites that support developers. Yet, being aware of and choosing appropriate tools and components can have a significant impact on the outcome of a software project. In our study, we investigate link sharing on Stack Overflow to gain insights into how software developers discover and disseminate innovations. We find that link sharing is a significant phenomenon on Stack Overflow, that Stack Overflow is an important resource for software development innovation dissemination and that its part of a larger interconnected network of online resources used and referenced by developers. This knowledge can guide researchers and practitioners who build tools and services that support software developers in the exploration, discovery, and adoption of software development innovations.},

A concept of knowledge brokerage was proposed on the basis of the theory of social brokerage, and hypotheses were developed to verify the relational properties of brokerage opportunities. Social network analysis (SNA) was applied to conduct the egocentric network surveys and related analyses. Several new ways of evaluating the performance of knowledge sharing have been developed. The results verified the usability of brokerage as indicators of knowledge sharing. The results also can reveal efficiencies and deficiencies in knowledge dissemination among members of communities. These findings hold relevance for studies on the information technology practices of other professionals.},

abstract = {Online learning has been getting popular in higher education. Key functionalities of online learning environment include the access to a wider perspective of learning resources and the provision of social interactions between instructor-learners and among learners-learners. Recent empirical findings in online learning have acknowledged the importance of online knowledge sharing as an integral part of online learning, through the various forms of learner interactions within online learning environment, such as discussion forums, collaborative learning and communities building. However, recent studies still find mixed results that instructors and students are not always fully engaged in online learning activities. Without frequent and persistent interactions, it is doubtful whether online knowledge sharing could really take place in online learning environment. Thus, the present study examines prior literature to explore the motivational factors to online knowledge sharing. It is found that perceived online attachment motivation and perceived online relationship commitment are two determinants to online knowledge sharing. As a result of the literature review, theoretical propositions are developed to explain online knowledge sharing. Discussion section explains the theoretical and practical implications.},

To understand how these team dynamics play out in software development, we explore Git logs, which provide a complete change history of software repositories. In these repositories, we observe code additions, which represent successfully implemented ideas, and code deletions, which represent ideas that have failed or been superseded. By examining the patterns between these commit types, we can begin to understand how teams adopt new information. We specifically study what happens after a software library is adopted by a project, i.e., when a library is used for the first time in the project. We find that a variety of factors, including team size, library popularity, and prevalence on Stack Overflow are associated with how quickly teams learn and successfully adopt new software libraries.},

Thus, a few SE domain-specific tools are recently developed for detecting sentimental polarities (e.g., positivity, negativity). But, for capturing individual emotional states such as excitation, stress, depression, and relaxation, there is only one recent tool named DEVA, which uses a lexicon-based approach.We have developed MarValous, the first Machine Learning based tool for improved detection of the aforementioned emotional states in software engineering text. We evaluate MarValous using a dataset containing 5,122 comments collected from JIRA and Stack Overflow. From a quantitative evaluation, MarValous is found to have substantially outperformed DEVA achieving more than 83\% precision and more than 79\% recall.},

Research in this area, however, has dealt with only the text modality. With the increasingly multimodal nature of web content, we focus on extending these methods for CQA questions accompanied by images. Specifically, we leverage the success of representation learning for text and images in the visual question answering (VQA) domain and adapt the underlying concept and architecture for automated category classification and expert retrieval on image-based questions posted on Yahoo! Chiebukuro, the Japanese counterpart of Yahoo! Answers. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to tackle the multimodality challenge in CQA, and to adapt VQA models for tasks on a more ecologically valid source of visual questions. Our analysis of the differences between visual QA and community QA data drives our proposal of novel augmentations of an attention method tailored for CQA and use of auxiliary tasks for learning better grounding features. Our final model markedly outperforms the text-only and VQA model baselines for both tasks of classification and expert retrieval on real-world multimodal CQA data.},

We observed that developers sometimes use alternative data analytics APIs to improve program runtime performance while preserving functional equivalence. However, little is known on the characteristics and performance attributes of alternative data analytics APIs. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to extracting alternative implementations that invoke different data analytics APIs to solve the same tasks. A key appeal of our approach is that it exploits the comparative structures in Stack Overflow discussions to discover programming alternatives. We show that our approach is promising, as 86\% of the extracted code pairs were validated as true alternative implementations. In over 20\% of these pairs, the faster implementation was reported to achieve a 10x or more speedup over its slower alternative. We hope that our study offers a new perspective of API recommendation and motivates future research on optimizing data analytics programs.},

abstract = {Word embeddings allow words used in similar contexts to have similar meanings. Due to this property word embeddings are widely used as an input feature for classification, clustering and sentiment analysis of natural language (NL) textual data produced during the software development process. Since the accuracy of these machine learning (ML) tasks depends on how well the word embeddings vectors capture the contextual information, it is important to train these models on software engineering (SE) specific text corpus. This paper proposes a pre-trained word embeddings model for SE which captures and reflects the domain-specific meanings of SE related words. We create a domain-specific text corpus by crawling the SE category on Wikipedia and use it for training the word embeddings model. We show that our model can outperform the state-of-the-art word embeddings model trained on Google news in terms of its representational power. More specifically, our model is able to express the SE specific meaning of polysemous words and recognize SE-specific technical words. Additionally, we also show that for almost all the words related to the fundamental SE activities, our model is either comparable or better than the SE-specific model trained over Stack Overflow (SO) posts.},

Our empirical study examined the influence of knowledge-sharing blog on learning outcome and learner satisfaction in e-learning environments. Three different settings were studied: two were e-learning environments—with knowledge-sharing blog, and without knowledge-sharing blog. The third was the traditional classroom environment. Results of the experiment showed that the value of sharing motivation for learning effectiveness was contingent upon the provision of knowledge-sharing. Students in the e-learning environment that provided knowledge-sharing blog achieved significantly better learning performance and a higher level of learner satisfaction than those in other settings. However, students who used the e-learning environment that provided without knowledge-sharing blog did not improve either. The findings suggest that it may be important to integrate knowledge-sharing blog into e-learning systems.},

In this study, we aim to open the "black box" in the relationship between conflict and knowledge sharing. This paper presents a mediational model of knowledge sharing and tests how three psychological states (psychological meaningfulness, availability, and safety) and knowledge workers' engagement mediate the effects of two types of conflict on knowledge sharing. Results of a study of 144 knowledge workers showed that task conflicts have positive effects on three psychological states, while relationship conflicts have negative effects. Furthermore, three psychological states affected workers' engagement and knowledge sharing behaviors. The results supported an integrative perspective on how workers' psychological processes affected workers' knowledge sharing behavior in different conflict contexts.},

The theory of complete and perfect two-stage dynamic game of knowledge sharing based on work competition model has been applied to the analysis on knowledge sharing in virtual enterprise. The member enterprise will choose knowledge sharing level to make marginal income equal to the value of negative utility by sharing its knowledge at Nash Equilibrium. The hegemony enterprise should formulate a reasonable stimulation policy and give enough bounty to the member enterprise who has contributed more knowledge to the virtual enterprise through knowledge sharing. There is a positive correlation between stimulation level and the variance of random item probability distribution of production function.},

abstract = {Product-specific community question answering platforms can greatly help address the concerns of potential customers. However, the user-provided answers on such platforms often vary a lot in their qualities. Helpfulness votes from the community can indicate the overall quality of the answer, but they are often missing. Accurately predicting the helpfulness of an answer to a given question and thus identifying helpful answers is becoming a demanding need. Since the helpfulness of an answer depends on multiple perspectives instead of only topical relevance investigated in typical QA tasks, common answer selection algorithms are insufficient for tackling this task. In this paper, we propose the Review-guided Answer Helpfulness Prediction (RAHP) model that not only considers the interactions between QA pairs but also investigates the opinion coherence between the answer and crowds’ opinions reflected in the reviews, which is another important factor to identify helpful answers. Moreover, we tackle the task of determining opinion coherence as a language inference problem and explore the utilization of pre-training strategy to transfer the textual inference knowledge obtained from a specifically designed trained network. Extensive experiments conducted on real-world data across seven product categories show that our proposed model achieves superior performance on the prediction task.},

As tools to support team learning, various groupware has been utilized. In groupware utilization, there is variation among development sites, which is suggested to reflect the maturity of team learning. Therefore, a case analysis on a team with a higher maturity of team learning was performed using groupware utilization as a measure of knowledge sharing. The Gini coefficient is used to represent the distribution of assets in economics. An inversion of the Gini coefficient was used to represent the groupware utilization and defined as the contribution ratio of knowledge. When the contribution ratio of knowledge is large, knowledge sharing is considered to be progressing. The contribution ratio of knowledge in this case study was observed to improve in proportion to the duration of the team. In future, we will expand the measurement range and continue to verify the measurement of team learning maturity using the contribution ratio of knowledge. This study measures the state of the team by analyzing their responses to the questionnaire. If this verification is successful, we would be able to measure the progress of team learning using the contribution ratio of knowledge, which can be measured more easily and objectively without resorting to the questionnaire.},

abstract = {Stack Overflow is a popular question answering site that is focused on programming problems. Despite efforts to prevent asking questions that have already been answered, the site contains duplicate questions. This may cause developers to unnecessarily wait for a question to be answered when it has already been asked and answered. The site currently depends on its moderators and users with high reputation to manually mark those questions as duplicates, which not only results in delayed responses but also requires additional efforts. In this paper, we first perform a manual investigation to understand why users submit duplicate questions in Stack Overflow. Based on our manual investigation we propose a classification technique that uses a number of carefully chosen features to identify duplicate questions. Evaluation using a large number of questions shows that our technique can detect duplicate questions with reasonable accuracy. We also compare our technique with DupPredictor, a state-of-the-art technique for detecting duplicate questions, and we found that our proposed technique has a better recall-rate than that technique.},

This empirical study of knowledge sharing model in an accounting organisation is another knowledge management breakthrough whereby sharing process of tacit knowledge can be used as a strategic knowledge management process to support the knowledge flow and knowledge networks to improve accounting process, reporting structure and decision making process. This conceptual relationship model which integrates knowledge management solution through learning, leadership, culture and technology to improve knowledge sharing process, was empirically tested via survey questionnaires among all public sector accountants who are employed by the Accountant General’s Department of Malaysia. Through factor analysis and multiple regression analysis, the statistical results of this study indicated that performance evaluation and incentives has a high significant impact on the sharing performance of tacit knowledge as compared to the moderate significant factors of leadership roles in knowledge sharing culture and knowledge sharing technology.},

However, knowledge sharing is still a delicate process because the willingness to share knowledge might be hindered by the lack of favorable cultural antecedents or functional and geographic distances between the persons involved. Existing studies concerning knowledge cultures have discovered isolated cultural values favorable for individual knowledge sharing. However, studies taking cultural elements and boundary spanning knowledge sharing into consideration are still missing. To close this gap, a qualitative and inductive study has been conducted in an Austrian engineering company. We researched cultural antecedents for knowledge sharing between project teams. The results provided by the analysis technique of GABEK indicate that there are several cultural elements that foster knowledge sharing across boundaries as well as starting points for managers and employees to develop a knowledge culture.},

abstract = {Cyber resilient organizations, their functions and computing infrastructures, should be tolerant towards rapid and unexpected changes in the environment. Information security is an organization-wide common mission; whose success strongly depends on efficient knowledge sharing. For this purpose, semantic wikis have proved their strength as a flexible collaboration and knowledge sharing platforms. However, there has not been notable academic research on how semantic wikis could be used as information security management platform in organizations for improved cyber resilience. In this paper, we propose to use semantic wiki as an agile information security management platform. More precisely, the wiki contents are based on the structured model of the NIST Special Publication 800-53 information security control catalogue that is extended in the research with the additional properties that support the information security management and especially the security control implementation. We present common uses cases to manage the information security in organizations and how the use cases can be implemented using the semantic wiki platform. As organizations seek cyber resilience, where focus is in the availability of cyber-related assets and services, we extend the control selection with option to focus on availability. The results of the study show that a semantic wiki based information security management and collaboration platform can provide a cost-efficient solution for improved cyber resilience, especially for small and medium sized organizations that struggle to develop information security with the limited resources.},

The results show that virtual community culture has direct positive impact on group cohesion but no direct positive impact on knowledge sharing. In addition, group cohesion plays an intermediary role between virtual community culture and knowledge sharing, and has direct positive impact on knowledge sharing, which indicates that group cohesion is very important to Chinese netizens for knowledge sharing activity under the rapid changed environment of knowledge economy.},

abstract = {Map matching is important in many trajectory based applications like route optimization and traffic schedule, etc. As the widely used methods, Hidden Markov Model and its variants are well studied to provide accurate and efficient map matching service. However, HMM based methods fail to utilize the value of enormous trajectory big data, which are useful for the map matching task. Furthermore, with many following-up works, they are still easily influenced by the noisy records, which are very common in the real system. To solve these problems, we revisit the map matching task from the data perspective, and propose to utilize the great power of data to help solve these problems. We build a deep learning based model to utilize all the trajectory data for joint training and knowledge sharing. With the help of embedding techniques and sequence learning model with attention enhancement, our system does the map matching in the latent space, which is tolerant to the noise in the physical space. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms the widely used HMM based methods more than 10\% (absolute accuracy) and works robustly in the noisy settings in the meantime.},

The millions of question-answers (QA) already accessible in these cQA forums. The huge amount of QA makes it hard for the students to go through all possible QA for a better understanding of the concepts. To address this issue, this paper provides a technological solution “Topic-based text enrichment process” for a textbook with relevant QA pairs from cQA. We used techniques of natural language processing, topic modeling, and data mining to extract the most relevant QA sets and corresponding links of cQA to enrich the textbooks. This work provides all the relevant QAs for the important topics of the textbook to the students, therefore it helps them to learn the concept more quickly. Experiments were carried out on a variety of textbooks such as Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning by Christopher M Bishop, Data Mining Concepts \&amp; techniques by Jiawei Han, Information Theory, Inference, \&amp; Learning Algorithms by David J.C. MacKay, and National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT). The results prove that we are effective in learning enhancement by enhancing the textbooks on various subjects and across different grades with the relevant QA pairs using automated techniques. We also present the results of quiz sessions which were conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed model in establishing relevance to learning among students.},

abstract = {Build systems are essential for modern software maintenance and development, while build failures occur frequently across software systems, inducing non-negligible costs in development activities. Build failure resolution is a challenging problem and multiple studies have demonstrated that developers spend non-trivial time in resolving encountered build failures; to relieve manual efforts, automated resolution techniques are emerging recently, which are promising but still limitedly effective. Understanding how build failures are resolved in practice can provide guidelines for both developers and researchers on build issue resolution. Therefore, this work presents a comprehensive study of fix patterns in practical build failures. Specifically, we study 1,080 build issues of three popular build systems Maven, Ant, and Gradle from Stack Overflow, construct a fine-granularity taxonomy of 50 categories regarding to the failure symptoms, and summarize the fix patterns for different failure types. Our key findings reveal that build issues stretch over a wide spectrum of symptoms; 67.96\% of the build issues are fixed by modifying the build script code related to plugins and dependencies; and there are 20 symptom categories, more than half of whose build issues can be fixed by specific patterns. Furthermore, we also address the challenges in applying non-intuitive or simplistic fix patterns for developers.},

abstract = {For handling cross-domain distribution mismatch, a specially designed subspace and reconstruction transfer functions bridging multiple domains for heterogeneous knowledge sharing are wanted. In this paper, we propose a novel reconstruction-based transfer learning method called Latent Subspace Transfer Network (LSTN). We embed features/pixels of source and target into reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), in which the high dimensional features are mapped to nonlinear latent subspace by feeding them into MLP network. This approach is very simple but effective by combining both advantages of subspace learning and neural network. The adaptation behaviors can be achieved in the method of joint learning a set of hierarchical nonlinear subspace representation and optimal reconstruction matrix simultaneously. Notably, as the latent subspace model is a MLP Network, the layers in it can be optimized directly to avoid a pre-trained model which needs large-scale data. Experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing non-deep adaptation methods and exhibits classification performance comparable with that of modern deep adaptation methods.},

abstract = {Neural text matching models have been widely used in community question answering, information retrieval, and dialogue. However, these models designed for short texts cannot well address the long-form text matching problem, because there are many contexts in long-form texts can not be directly aligned with each other, and it is difficult for existing models to capture the key matching signals from such noisy data. Besides, these models are computationally expensive for simply use all textual data indiscriminately. To tackle the effectiveness and efficiency problem, we propose a novel hierarchical noise filtering model, namely Match-Ignition. The main idea is to plug the well-known PageRank algorithm into the Transformer, to identify and filter both sentence and word level noisy information in the matching process. Noisy sentences are usually easy to detect because previous work has shown that their similarity can be explicitly evaluated by the word overlapping, so we directly use PageRank to filter such information based on a sentence similarity graph. Unlike sentences, words rely on their contexts to express concrete meanings, so we propose to jointly learn the filtering and matching process, to well capture the critical word-level matching signals. Specifically, a word graph is first built based on the attention scores in each self-attention block of Transformer, and key words are then selected by applying PageRank on this graph. In this way, noisy words will be filtered out layer by layer in the matching process. Experimental results show that Match-Ignition outperforms both SOTA short text matching models and recent long-form text matching models. We also conduct detailed analysis to show that Match-Ignition efficiently captures important sentences and words, to facilitate the long-form text matching process.},

abstract = {The 2019 edition of Stack Overflow developer survey highlights that, for the first time, Python outperformed Java in terms of popularity. The gap between Python and Java further widened in the 2020 edition of the survey. Unfortunately, despite the rapid increase in Python's popularity, there are not many testing and debugging tools that are designed for Python. This is in stark contrast with the abundance of testing and debugging tools for Java. Thus, there is a need to push research on tools that can help Python developers.  One factor that contributed to the rapid growth of Java testing and debugging tools is the availability of benchmarks. A popular benchmark is the Defects4J benchmark; its initial version contained 357 real bugs from 5 real-world Java programs. Each bug comes with a test suite that can expose the bug. Defects4J has been used by hundreds of testing and debugging studies and has helped to push the frontier of research in these directions.  In this project, inspired by Defects4J, we create another benchmark database and tool that contain 493 real bugs from 17 real-world Python programs. We hope our benchmark can help catalyze future work on testing and debugging tools that work on Python programs.},

Among the 58 medical consortia in Beijing, a medical consortium has Since the establishment of the body, the participation of medical staff, the satisfaction of doctors and patients, the degree of professionalism and the number of referrals have been relatively high, showing a relatively prominent effect. This phenomenon has attracted our attention. This paper analyzes the relationship between the learning culture and professionalism of the cross-departmental medical team organization through interviews and literature analysis. The analysis process is mainly based on the theory of resource preservation, and uses correlation analysis and regression analysis to analyze the relationship between the two. The theoretical relationship between the two was verified, and the study found that there is a significant positive correlation between organizational learning culture and professional engagement. Organizational learning culture provides resource support for team members and enhances their professional engagement. It is also suggested that the medical consortium needs to strengthen the long-term and stability of teamwork in the reform process, and establish a systematic learning support and reward mechanism in the team; clarify the rights and responsibilities, increase authorization; establish a team knowledge sharing system and other measures. Improve member engagement and promote the deepening of medical reform.},

abstract = {Answer ranking is an important task in Community Question Answering (CQA), by which “Good” answers should be ranked in the front of “Bad” or “Potentially Useful” answers. The state of the art is the attention-based classification framework that learns the mapping between the questions and the answers. However, we observe that existing attention-based methods perform poorly on complicated question-answer pairs. One major reason is that existing methods cannot get accurate alignments between questions and answers for such pairs. We call the phenomenon “attention divergence”. In this paper, we propose a new attention mechanism, called Focusing Attention Network(FAN), which can automatically draw back the divergent attention by adding the semantic, and metadata features. Our Model can focus on the most important part of the sentence and therefore improve the answer ranking performance. Experimental results on the CQA dataset of SemEval-2016 and SemEval-2017 demonstrate that our method respectively attains 79.38 and 88.72 on MAP and outperforms the Top-1 system in the shared task by 0.19 and 0.29.},

abstract = {Online professional communities on Twitter are increasingly gaining attention among users due to benefits such as knowledge sharing, professional development, and relationship building. Millions of hashtags are used every day in different disciplines (e.g., #educhat) or everyday situations (e.g. #MondayMotivation). Hashtags have led to the creation of conversations about topics (e.g., #highered), serving as a point of connection among different types of users. In the academic world, the hashtag #AcademicTwitter has evolved into an online community of educators, graduate students, organizations, and others engaged in the discussion of topics and issues related to academic life, funny moments, and survival stories. This paper examines participants and communication patterns in the #AcademicTwitter community. Using content analysis and social network analysis techniques, the researchers examined tweets including the #AcademicTwitter hashtag to discover the community’s network properties, roles of the participants, sentiment, and conversational themes. Findings indicated that the conversation was not centered on one topic, instead several micro-communities were found. Top participants in the #AcademicTwitter community were educators, media platforms, and other professionals which centered on conversations related to topics such as accessibility, academic life experiences, and teaching and research support. The study of social media in academic professional settings is still new. Our work contributes to the literature of social networks in academia, helping better understand how users connect and the network that supports the #AcademicTwitter community.},

abstract = {Since static taint analysis is performed prior to execution by considering all possible execution paths, it can discover potential security issues before the program running. Currently, many taint analysis tools pay more attention to data dependence in the program. Whereas implicit flow analysis based on control dependence is generally not considered owning to its complexity. Therefore, this paper presents a static taint analysis method named DepTaint, which expands the static checkers of LLVM, focuses on program dependence including data and control dependence in the program. DepTaint analyzes the taint variables propagated along explicit flows and implicit flows, especially commendably handles the under-taint in explicit flow analysis. Our evaluations demonstrate that, for 8 programs containing data and control dependence and 8 programs injected different common vulnerabilities (i.e., array bounds, double free, format string vulnerability, heap overflow, integer overflow, stack overflow, and UAF), DepTaint significantly outperforms LLVM's static checker both at marking taint variables and achieving more finegrained taint propagation paths. Specially, for the programs containing branch selection and loop structure, DepTaint on average marks 2X and 3.6X taint variables than LLVM's static checker.},

Most existing approaches tackle this problem as a text matching task. However, they ignore the influence of the community in voting the best answers. Answer quality is highly correlated with semantic relevance and user expertise in CQA. In this paper, we formalize the answer selection problem from the user expertise view, considering both the semantic relevance in question-answer pair and user expertise in question-user pair. We design a novel matching function, explicitly modeling the influence of user expertise in community acceptance. Moreover, we introduce latent user vectors into the representation learning of answer, capturing the implicit topic interests in learned user vectors. Extensive experiments on two datasets from real world CQA sites demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art approaches for answer selection in CQA. Furthermore, the user representations learned by our model provide us a quantitative way to understand both the authority and topic-sensitive interests of users.},

abstract = {Spinal surgery planning necessitates automatic segmentation of vertebrae in cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT), an intraoperative imaging modality that is widely used in intervention. However, CBCT images are of low-quality and artifact-laden due to noise, poor tissue contrast, and the presence of metallic objects, causing vertebra segmentation, even manually, a demanding task. In contrast, there exists a wealth of artifact-free, high quality CT images with vertebra annotations. This motivates us to build a CBCT vertebra segmentation model using unpaired CT images with annotations. To overcome the domain and artifact gaps between CBCT and CT, it is a must to address the three heterogeneous tasks of vertebra segmentation, artifact reduction and modality translation all together. To this, we propose a novel anatomy-aware artifact disentanglement and segmentation network (A3DSegNet) that intensively leverages knowledge sharing of these three tasks to promote learning. Specifically, it takes a random pair of CBCT and CT images as the input and manipulates the synthesis and segmentation via different decoding combinations from the disentangled latent layers. Then, by proposing various forms of consistency among the synthesized images and among segmented vertebrae, the learning is achieved without paired (i.e., anatomically identical) data. Finally, we stack 2D slices together and build 3D networks on top to obtain final 3D segmentation result. Extensive experiments on a large number of clinical CBCT (21,364) and CT (17,089) images show that the proposed A3DSegNet performs significantly better than state-of-the-art competing methods trained independently for each task and, remarkably, it achieves an average Dice coefficient of 0.926 for unpaired 3D CBCT vertebra segmentation.},

abstract = {The increasing variety of programming languages available to computer programmers has led to the discussion of what language(s) should be learned. A key point in the choice of a programming language is the availability of support from experienced programmers. In this paper, we explore the use of graph theory in recommending programming languages to novice and expert programmers in a question and answer collaborative learning environment, Stack Overflow. Using social network analysis techniques, we investigate the relationship between experts (using an expertise graph) in different programming languages to identify what languages can be recommended to novice and experienced programmers. In addition, we explore the use of the expertise graph in inferring the importance of a programming language to the community. Our results suggest that programming languages can be recommended within organizational borders and programming domains. In addition, a high number of experts in a programming language does not always mean that the language is popular. Furthermore, disconnected nodes in the expertise graph suggest that experts in some programming languages are primarily on Stack Overflow to support that language only and do not contribute to questions or answers in other languages. Finally, developers are comfortable with mastering a single, general purpose language. The results of our study can help educators and stakeholders in computer education to understand what programming languages can be suggested to students and what languages can be taught and learned together.},

We present (1) a process model for change management and traceability (CM-T) for cloud-based GSD, and then (2) detail our management approach for system engineering processes as part of the presented GSD guidelines.Results: To ensure that the defined CM-T process model complies with the CMMI Level 2 (Baseline) Capability, the process model is validated using an expert panel review process where a total average, 85.58\% of the experts support the maturity of the process model. Also, we demonstrate the continual tight linkage of stakeholders’ requirements and system engineering processes towards change management and traceability, with an Airlock Control System case study.},

We analyzed accessibility metrics such as the steps from the main documentation page, tagging or multilingualism as well as structure and readability metrics such as code-to-text ratio, number of links, and Flesch Reading-Ease. In addition, we compared these FAQs to 69,548 Stack Overflow (SO) posts, which cover the same topics and which have been posted by developers at least twice (i.e. duplicates). Our results reveal that different software vendors give different importance to their FAQs, e.g. by investing more effort or less in structuring and presenting them. We found that studied FAQs include more references (e.g. to corresponding API documentation) and are more verbose and difficult to read than corresponding SO duplicates. We also found that FAQs cover additional topics compared to corresponding duplicate posts.},

abstract = {Asking a clarifying question can be a key element improving the performance of information seeking systems, particularly conversational search systems due to their limited bandwidth interfaces. While generating and asking clarifying questions is important; get-ting an answer for the clarifying question is also essential as a clarifying question without an answer is useless. Therefore, as the first step in current research, we analysed human-generated clarifying questions in a Community Question Answering website as a sample of conversation. This helped us to gain a better insight into how users interact with clarification. We investigated the clarifying questions in terms of whether they add any information to the question and the accepted answer. We further discovered the patterns and types of such clarifying questions. The next phase of this research will then generate clarifying questions in conversational search systems. We will then employ neural network models to generate clarifying questions to maximise clarification in questions. The proposed model will be trained using the MIMICS data collection in addition to our collected dataset. We will also attempt to consider the recognised patterns from the analysis conducted in the first step to enhance the chance that a user will interact with the clarifying questions. Finally, we will aim to minimise the interaction between the search system and the user to reduce the risk of dropping the conversation by the user due to asking too many clarifying questions.},

abstract = {Deep learning (DL) becomes increasingly pervasive, being used in a wide range of software applications. These software applications, named as DL based software (in short as DL software), integrate DL models trained using a large data corpus with DL programs written based on DL frameworks such as TensorFlow and Keras. A DL program encodes the network structure of a desirable DL model and the process by which the model is trained using the training data. To help developers of DL software meet the new challenges posed by DL, enormous research efforts in software engineering have been devoted. Existing studies focus on the development of DL software and extensively analyze faults in DL programs. However, the deployment of DL software has not been comprehensively studied. To fill this knowledge gap, this paper presents a comprehensive study on understanding challenges in deploying DL software. We mine and analyze 3,023 relevant posts from Stack Overflow, a popular Q&amp;A website for developers, and show the increasing popularity and high difficulty of DL software deployment among developers. We build a taxonomy of specific challenges encountered by developers in the process of DL software deployment through manual inspection of 769 sampled posts and report a series of actionable implications for researchers, developers, and DL framework vendors.},

While using the programming-by-example paradigm to help users write SQL queries is an attractive proposition, as evidenced by online help forums such as Stack Overflow, developing techniques for synthesizing SQL queries from given input-output (I/O) examples has been difficult, due to the large space of SQL queries as a result of its rich set of operators.   In this paper, we present a new scalable and efficient algorithm for synthesizing SQL queries based on I/O examples. The key innovation of our algorithm is development of a language for abstract queries, i.e., queries with uninstantiated operators, that can be used to express a large space of SQL queries efficiently. Using abstract queries to represent the search space nicely decomposes the synthesis problem into two tasks: 1) searching for abstract queries that can potentially satisfy the given I/O examples, and 2) instantiating the found abstract queries and ranking the results.   We have implemented this algorithm in a new tool called Scythe and evaluated it using 193 benchmarks collected from Stack Overflow. Our evaluation shows that Scythe can efficiently solve 74\% of the benchmarks, most in just a few seconds, and the queries range from simple ones involving a single selection to complex queries with 6 nested subqueires.},

abstract = {Plenty of research attempts target the automatic duplicate detection in Community Question Answering (CQA) systems and frame the task as a supervised learning problem on the question pairs. However, these methods rely on handcrafted features, leading to the difficulty of distinguishing related and duplicate questions as they are often textually similar. To tackle this issue, we propose to leverage neural network architecture to extract "deep" features to identify whether a question pair is duplicate or related. In particular, we construct question correlation matrices, which capture the word-wise similarities between questions. The constructed matrices are input to our proposed convolutional neural network (CNN), in which the convolutional operation moves through the two dimensions of the matrices. Empirical studies on a range of real-world CQA datasets confirm the effectiveness of our proposed correlation matrices and the CNN. Our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods and achieves better classification performance.},

abstract = {Idea networks are inherently illustrative of the domain knowledge they seek to capture. They provide pathways to retrace known paths, and to explore the unknown. In this study, we conceptualised an idea network of 639 roguelike games, using data collected from RogueBasin and other sources, and conducted a user study for designer insight. Study participants interacted with three idea network visualisations that support exploration of design influence, accompanied by a brief historical context of roguelike games, and our design process of visualisations. The study uncovered 6 classes of insights from game developers: thinking in networks, insights on data consistency, accessibility and usability, visualisation preferences, exploring related games, and data contributions from the community. The study is limited by the data sources available about design influences, acknowledging that idea networks are only a partial representation of the full picture, which cannot be known. However, this paper shows that even a partial idea network can be useful for exploring the ancestry of roguelikes and their design influences. It also showed how idea networks can facilitate knowledge sharing through online conversations and new lines of inquiry.},

abstract = {Modern software system stacks are composed of large numbers of software components. These components may include a broad range of entities such as services, libraries, and frameworks, all intended to address specific requirements. It is not only necessary that these components satisfy respective functional and non-functional concerns, but also that the combinations of selected components work well together. The space of component combinations to explore is huge. Together with the almost universal lack of formal documentation suggesting desirable combinations and cautioning against undesirable ones, this renders the proper selection of combinations very challenging. For this reason, software engineers often solicit advice and document their experience on online forums such as community Q&amp;A sites. In this paper, we show that these Q&amp;A sites contain valuable knowledge about inter-component relations. We develop an approach using information extraction techniques to automatically identify three different types of compatibility relations from unstructured text on Q&amp;A site postings. Our work demonstrates that identifying such relations is valuable for the design of component-based systems and that automatic relation extraction is a promising technique to systematically harness such community knowledge.},

abstract = {Nowadays, millions of users use community question answering (CQA) systems to share valuable knowledge. An essential function of CQA systems is the accurate matching of answers w.r.t a given question. Recent research exhibits the superior advantages of graph neural networks (GNNs) on modeling content semantics for CQA matching. However, existing GNN-based approaches are insufficient to deal with the multi-modal and redundant properties of CQA systems. In this paper, we propose a multi-modal attentive graph pooling approach (MMAGP) to model the multi-modal content of questions and answers with GNNs in a unified framework, which explores the multi-modal and redundant properties of CQA systems. Our model converts each question/answer into a multi-modal content graph, which can preserve the relational information within multi-modal content. Specifically, to exploit the visual information, we propose an unsupervised meta-path link prediction approach to extract labels from visual content and model them into the multi-modal graph. An attentive graph pooling network is proposed to select vertices in the multi-modal content graph that are significant for the matching adaptively, and generate a pooled graph via aggregating context information for selected vertices. An interaction pooling network is designed to infer the final matching score based on the interactions between the pooled graphs of the input question and answer. Experimental results on two real-world datasets demonstrate the superior performance of MMAGP compared with other state-of-the-art CQA matching models.},

We first define a content syndication based knowledge sharing network, and then we propose a knowledge recommendation algorithm based on content syndication in knowledge sharing network. This algorithm combines the relationship between users with their search history to carry out knowledge recommendation and has both theoretical and practical value.},

abstract = {The users' need to quickly assemble information, online services and applications is stimulating the development of paradigms that are able to integrate data, functionality and user interfaces from the Web. In this context, data, services, applications, and knowledge can be viewed as entities of a Digital Ecosystem, defined as a virtual environment that supports the mash-up, knowledge sharing and management among the multiple and independent entities, which are part of this environment. This is particularly important with respect to the creativeness and innovation at social and economic level.This paper provides SHAPES web platform, that combines, in an ecosystemic approach, online social media and services for the creation and management of distributed knowledge, and the creation of intelligent services for communities of creative enterprises. The main features of the SHAPES on-line platform are described. The description underlines how the platform allows connecting the actors involved in the ecosystem with relevant services provided by means of the framework components, and the role of the ecosystemic environment in offering significant opportunities in terms of services and knowledge sharing, integration and collaboration.},

In this study we examine whether there are differences between women in OSS community and outside of it. Identifying these differences may help to attract other women to contribute to OSS. Furthermore, it might uncover potential biases in data about female developers that are gathered through the mining of software repositories research.Using the data from the Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2018, counting 100,000+ respondents (6.9\% female), we compare the characteristics of women who report to contribute to OSS and those who report to not contribute. Surprisingly, we did not found the expected differences to be present, thus suggesting that open-source software data represents well the closed-source population of female developers. However, our results did not identify potential correlates of higher under-representation of women in OSS than in closed-source setting.},

The proposed techniques are designed to discover the maximum possible amount of know-how knowledge from such collections of Web pages, where know-how knowledge is defined as text contents qualified as information source regarding specific domain of questions. The major intent is to build a framework that selects helpful information to provide answers to various problems of interest, such as useful tips to a question. Techniques in this paper primarily attempt to complement knowledge available on Q&amp;A sites with pages collected from search engines via topic models. In order to argue that pages collected from search engine are truly supplements to know- how knowledge on Q&amp;A sites we verify how much extra useful information the Web search engine is able to provide by manually inspecting Web pages aggregated by the topic model.},

abstract = {Promptly and accurately answering questions on products is important for e-commerce applications. Manually answering product questions (e.g. on community question answering platforms) results in slow response and does not scale. Recent studies show that product reviews are a good source for real-time, automatic product question answering (PQA). In the literature, PQA is formulated as a retrieval problem with the goal to search for the most relevant reviews to answer a given product question. In this paper, we focus on the issue of answerability and answer reliability for PQA using reviews. Our investigation is based on the intuition that many questions may not be answerable with a finite set of reviews. When a question is not answerable, a system should return nil answers rather than providing a list of irrelevant reviews, which can have significant negative impact on user experience. Moreover, for answerable questions, only the most relevant reviews that answer the question should be included in the result. We propose a conformal prediction based framework to improve the reliability of PQA systems, where we reject unreliable answers so that the returned results are more concise and accurate at answering the product question, including returning nil answers for unanswerable questions. Experiments on a widely used Amazon dataset show encouraging results of our proposed framework. More broadly, our results demonstrate a novel and effective application of conformal methods to a retrieval task.},

abstract = {Automatic API recommendation has been studied for years. There are two orthogonal lines of approaches for this task, i.e., information-retrieval-based (IR-based) and neural-based methods. Although these approaches were reported having remarkable performance, our observation shows that existing approaches can fail due to the following two reasons: 1) most IR-based approaches treat task queries as bag-of-words and use word embedding to represent queries, which cannot capture the sequential semantic information. 2) both the IR-based and the neural-based approaches are weak at distinguishing the semantic difference among lexically similar queries.In this paper, we propose CLEAR, which leverages BERT sentence embedding and contrastive learning to tackle the above two issues. Specifically, CLEAR embeds the whole sentence of queries and Stack Overflow (SO) posts with a BERT-based model rather than the bag-of-word-based word embedding model, which can preserve the semantic-related sequential information. In addition, CLEAR uses contrastive learning to train the BERT-based embedding model for learning precise semantic representation of programming terminologies regardless of their lexical information. CLEAR also builds a BERT-based re-ranking model to optimize its recommendation results. Given a query, CLEAR first selects a set of candidate SO posts via the BERT sentence embedding-based similarity to reduce search space. CLEAR further leverages a BERT-based re-ranking model to rank candidate SO posts and recommends the APIs from the ranked top SO posts for the query.Our experiment results on three different test datasets confirm the effectiveness of CLEAR for both method-level and class-level API recommendation. Compared to the state-of-the-art API recommendation approaches, CLEAR improves the MAP by 25\%-187\% at method-level and 10\%-100\% at class-level.},

abstract = {Community question answering aims at choosing the most appropriate answer for a given question, which is important in many NLP applications. Previous neural network-based methods consider several different aspects of information through calculating attentions. These different kinds of attentions are always simply summed up and can be seen as a "single view", causing severe information loss. To overcome this problem, we propose a Multi-View Fusion Neural Network, where each attention component generates a "view" of the QA pair and a fusion RNN integrates the generated views to form a more holistic representation. In this fusion RNN method, a filter gate collects important information of input and directly adds it to the output, which borrows the idea of residual networks. Experimental results on the WikiQA and SemEval-2016 CQA datasets demonstrate that our proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.},

Organizational culture, informal roles, and individual attitudes interact to influence organizational processes such as knowledge sharing, a process vital to organizational performance and innovation. To explore such organizational dynamics, we developed an agent-based model (ABM) that incorporates dynamic social networks over the physical environment of a hospital in southwest Virginia. The ABM simulates attitude formation and knowledge spread within the hospital. Social networks are dynamically created as agents interact while simple rules based on cascade and threshold models of diffusion drive the decision to share knowledge. Results show that there is a strong effect by formal roles in the hospital that are important in social network development and knowledge diffusion.},

Knowledge extraction often relies on meta data. This meta data can either be harvested from user-provided tags, or inferred by algorithms from the respective data. The question arises to which extent either type of meta data can be trusted and relied upon.We study this problem in the context of language identification of code snippets posted on Stack Overflow. We analyse the consistency between user-provided tags and the classification obtained with GitHub linguist, an industry-strength automated language recognition tool. We find that the results obtained by both approaches are often not consistent. This indicates that both have to be used with great care. Our results also suggest that developers may not follow the evolutionary path of programming languages beyond one step when seeking or providing answers to software engineering challenges encountered.},

abstract = {Wikis have emerged as easy and flexible tools for accessing and sharing knowledge on the internet and within organizations. Due to their highly collaborative nature, users can typically modify and create content without any access restrictions since these are replaced by social practices. On the other hand, due to the lack of central guidance, knowledge sharing is driven by the individual choice of contributors. We claim that --- especially in enterprise settings --- the lack of guidance for content creation is a major problem. We therefore analyze search and knowledge sharing in current Wikis. To improve knowledge sharing, we present the Woogle concept, which introduces "Social Search" and "Need-driven Knowledge Sharing" into Wikis. We describe our prototype implementation Woogle4MediaWiki and results from initial evaluation studies.},

With the increasing community size and amount of user generated content, a task of expert identification arose. To tackle this problem, various reputation mechanisms exist, however, they estimate user reputation especially according to overall user activity, while the quality of contributions is considered only secondary. As the result, reputation usually does not reflect the real value of users' contributions and, moreover, some users so called reputation collectors purposefully abuse reputation systems to achieve a high reputation score. We propose a novel reputation mechanism that focuses primarily on the quality and difficulty of users' contributions. Calculated reputation was compared with four baseline methods including the reputation schema employed in Stack Exchange platform. The experimental results showed a higher precision achieved by our approach, and confirmed an important role of contribution quality and difficulty in estimation of user reputation.},

abstract = {Community question answering (cQA) systems have enjoyed the benefits of advances in neural information retrieval, some models of which need annotated documents as supervised data. However, in contrast with the amount of supervised data for cQA systems, user-generated data in cQA sites have been increasing greatly with time. Thus, focusing on unsupervised models, we tackle a task of retrieving relevant answers for new questions from existing cQA data and propose two frameworks to exploit a Question Retrieval (QR) model for Answer Retrieval (AR). The first framework ranks answers according to the combined scores of QR and AR models and the second framework ranks answers using the scores of a QR model and best answer flags. In our experiments, we applied the combination of our proposed frameworks and a classical fusion technique to AR models with a Japanese cQA data set containing approximately 9.4M question-answer pairs. When best answer flags in the cQA data cannot be utilized, our combination of AR and QR scores with data fusion outperforms a base AR model on average. When best answer flags can be utilized, the retrieval performance can be improved further. While our results lack statistical significance, we discuss effect sizes as well as future sample sizes to attain sufficient statistical power.},

MyLake is a National Lake Database to manage information and knowledge sharing on lakes in Malaysia. At the moment, data are uploaded by each agency using MyLake as a platform. Nevertheless, this is carried out manually and require timely human effort. Each agency does one-to-one data integration (in-silo) where the integration is developed according to the agency-specific needs resulting from a possibility of integration issue across agencies. Therefore, this paper introduces a big data integration approach that extends the MyLake repository. The big data integration platform is a preliminary idea of how data can be shared, integrated, retrieved, and disseminated within a reliable and authenticated environment.

abstract = {Background: Open innovation highlights the potential benefits of external collaboration and knowledge-sharing, often exemplified through Open Source Software (OSS). The public sector has thus far mainly focused on the sharing of Open Government Data (OGD), often with a supply-driven approach with limited feedback-loops. We hypothesize that public sector organizations can extend the open innovation benefits by also creating platforms, where OGD, related OSS, and open standards are collaboratively developed and shared. Objective: The objective of this study is to explore how public sector organizations in the role of platform providers facilitate such collaboration in the form of OGD ecosystems and how the ecosystem’s governance may be structured to support the collaboration. Method: We conduct an exploratory multiple-case study of two such ecosystems, focused on OGD related to the Swedish labor market and public transport sector, respectively. Data is gathered through interviews, document studies, and prolonged engagement at one of the platform providers. Results: The study presents governance structure and collaboration practices of the two ecosystems and discusses how these contribute to the platform providers’ goals. The case studies highlight the need for platform providers to take an active and multi-functional role in enabling the sharing of data and software from and between the members of the ecosystem. Conclusions: We conclude that OGD ecosystems offer public sector organizations a possibility to catalyze the potential innovation output of OGD, but that it requires investment and adoption of an open and collaborative mindset.},

abstract = {Research has shown that persuasive technologies are more effective when they are personalized. Persuasive strategies work differently for various people; hence a one size fits all approach may not bring about the desired change in behavior or attitude. This paper contributes to personalization in question and answer (Q&amp;A) social networks by exploring the possibility of personalizing social influence strategies based on the computer programming skill level and the highest level of education of users. In particular, this paper explores the susceptibility of users in Stack Overflow, a Q&amp;A social network, to social support influence strategies for novice and expert computer programmers. In addition, we explore if first degree holders respond to the social support influence strategies the same way graduate degree holders do. Using a sample size of 282 Stack Overflow users, we constructed four models using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modelling (PLS-SEM) and carried out multi-group analysis between these models. The results of our analysis show that social facilitation significantly influences cooperation for novice programmers, but not for expert programmers. In addition, social learning does not significantly influence the persuasiveness of the system for expert programmers compared to users who are novice in computer programming. For the users grouped according to their highest level of education, social learning influenced cooperation among the graduate degree holders and competition influenced the graduate degree holders to continue using the system. The result of this study can provide useful guidelines to social network developers that can be used in implementing personalized influence strategies in Q&amp;A social communities.},

abstract = {Community-based question answering (cQA) sites have become important knowledge sharing platforms, as massive cQA pairs are archived, but the uneven quality of cQA pairs leaves information seekers unsatisfied. Various efforts have been dedicated to predicting the quality of cQA contents. Most of them concatenate different features into single vectors and then feed them into regression models. In fact, the quality of cQA pairs is influenced by different views, and the agreement among them is essential for quality assessment. Besides, the lacking of labeled data significantly hinders the quality prediction performance. Toward this end, we present a transductive multi-view learning model. It is designed to find a latent common space by unifying and preserving information from various views, including question, answer, QA relevance, asker, and answerer. Additionally, rich information in the unlabeled test cQA pairs are utilized via transductive learning to enhance the representation ability of the common space. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets have well-validated the proposed model.},

abstract = {In this demo, we present VIZ-Wiki, a browser extension which generates an overview of summarizable threads in Question Answering forums. It reduces a user's effort to go through lengthy text-based, sarcastic and highly critiqued answers. Our tool can be used to collect community opinion from popular discussion sites like Quora, Yahoo! Answers, Reddit etc. as well as topic-centric ones such as Askubuntu, Stackoverflow. We rely on textual information of these forums to extract insightful summaries for a reader. VIZ-Wiki provides users a pie-graph view marking popular choices when such a question link is raised. A button guides them to detailed statistics and relevant list of answers. It further highlights sentences relevant to an answer choice in the text. VIZ-Wiki deals with answers contradicted by other users, prioritizes highly-recommended ones and avoids sarcasm. We test our model on the factoid questions dataset of Yahoo! Answers and obtain a macro precision of 0.6 on displayed answers and a macro recall of 0.69, beating the baseline significantly. To the best of our knowledge, VIZ-Wiki is the first attempt to visualize answers for questions in community question answering services. In the spirit of reproducibility, we have released the code and a demonstration video public at urlhttp://goo.gl/cyx3EF and urlhttps://youtu.be/XNmRa_jtmC8 respectively},

In this study, the authors utilized a knowledge-sharing failure scenario to test the effects of status and culture on attributions with a survey conducted among 127 Chinese and 120 Koreans. The results showed that both Chinese and Koreans felt significantly more disappointed when the failure occurred because of the senior’s rather than the junior’s ability-related issues. Chinese participants tended to ascribe the failure significantly more to contexts than ability, while Korean participants had the opposite tendency. Although both Chinese and Korean participants gave lower ratings on motivation attribution when the one who failed to share knowledge was a peer, the gap was markedly larger for Korean participants. Further testing on self-construal revealed that Korean participants rated individualism significantly higher than their Chinese counterparts did. The results indicated that even in two similar cultures the status effects on attribution can differ. Managers of international companies should respond accordingly to group affairs regarding status issue.},

One of them is user do not provide the proper keyword called Tag to their question that summarizes their question domain and topic. Tag plays an important role in questions asked by the users in Community Question Answering (CQA) sites. They are used for grouping questions and finding relevant answerers in these sites. Users of these sites can select a tag from the existing tag list or contribute a new tag to their questions. The process of tagging is manual, which results in inconsistent and sometimes even incorrect or incomplete tagging. To overcome this issue, we design an automatic tag suggestion technique which can suggest tags to the users based on their question text. It serves to minimize the error of the manual tagging system by providing more relevant tags to questions. The performance of the proposed system is evaluated using Precision, Recall, and F1-score.},

A systematic analysis on how frequently insecure coding practices appear in SO answers can help the SO community assess the prevalence of insecure Python code blocks in SO. An insecure coding practice is recurrent use of insecure coding patterns in Python. We conduct an empirical study using 529,054 code blocks collected from Python-related 44,966 answers posted on SO. We observe 7.1\% of the 44,966 Python-related answers to include at least one insecure coding practice. The most frequently occurring insecure coding practice is code injection. We observe 9.8\% of the 7,444 accepted answers to include at least one insecure code block. We also find user reputation not to relate with the presence of insecure code blocks, suggesting that both high and low-reputed users are likely to introduce insecure code blocks.},

abstract = {The residual unit and its variations are wildly used in building very deep neural networks for alleviating optimization difficulty. In this work, we revisit the standard residual function as well as its several successful variants and propose a unified framework based on tensor Block Term Decomposition (BTD) to explain these apparently different residual functions from the tensor decomposition view. With the BTD framework, we further propose a novel basic network architecture, named the Collective Residual Unit (CRU). CRU further enhances parameter efficiency of deep residual neural networks by sharing core factors derived from collective tensor factorization over the involved residual units. It enables efficient knowledge sharing across multiple residual units, reduces the number of model parameters, lowers the risk of over-fitting, and provides better generalization ability. Extensive experimental results show that our proposed CRU network brings outstanding parameter efficiency-- it achieves comparable classification performance with ResNet-200 while using a model size as small as ResNet-50 on the ImageNet-1k and Places365-Standard benchmark datasets.},

abstract = {(Good) Software documentation provides developers and users with a description of what a software system does, how it operates, and how it should be used. For example, technical documentation (e.g., an API reference guide) aids developers during evolution/maintenance activities, while a user manual explains how users are to interact with a system. Despite its intrinsic value, the creation and the maintenance of documentation is often neglected, negatively impacting its quality and usefulness, ultimately leading to a generally unfavorable take on documentation.Previous studies investigating documentation issues have been based on surveying developers, which naturally leads to a somewhat biased view of problems affecting documentation. We present a large scale empirical study, where we mined, analyzed, and categorized 878 documentation-related artifacts stemming from four different sources, namely mailing lists, Stack Overflow discussions, issue repositories, and pull requests. The result is a detailed taxonomy of documentation issues from which we infer a series of actionable proposals both for researchers and practitioners.},

This set of troll questions spans a lengthy period of time and a diverse set of topical categories. Our analysis reveals unique characteristics of troll questions when compared to "regular" questions, with regards to their metadata, text, and askers. A classifier built upon these features reaches an accuracy of 85\% over a balanced dataset. The answers' text and metadata, reflecting the community's response to the question, are found particularly productive for the classification task.},

abstract = {Matching between questions and suitable users is an appealing and challenging problem in the research area of community question answering (CQA). Usually, different from the traditional recommendation systems where a user has only a single role, each user in CQA can play two different roles (dual roles) simultaneously: as a requester and as an answerer. For different roles, users usually have varying interests and expertise in different topics and knowledge domains, which is rarely addressed in the previous methods. Besides, based on an explicit single link between two users, existing methods cannot capture implicit associations between their possibly similar roles. Therefore, in this paper, we propose the structure of a dual role graph and employ the link prediction approach to make CQA recommendation on the graph. Moreover, we develop a Dual Role Neural Graph auto-encoder (DRNGae) framework, which can: 1) encode the dual role graph structure to capture the implicit dual role correlation by propagating high-order information embeddings of graph neural network; 2) learn variable weights with the dual role feature preferences from dual role content information by self-attention mechanism; 3) reconstruct the graph structure to predict the possible interaction links. Experimental studies on real-world datasets verify our design and prove that our model achieves significantly better performance than baselines in link prediction (95.3\% AUC, 96.2\% AP on Citeseer dataset) and CQA recommendation (79.5\% recall@25, 76.7\% ndcg@25 on Yahoo! answer dataset).},

The contributions of this paper are two-fold: (1) we propose a Siamese CNN model which measure correlation between questions and answers. (2) We first apply word2vec to learn the semantic relations between words and then construct a similar question retrieval model with answers. The study above can achieve a good performance in the real MCQA data set. It shows that our method can effectively extract similar questions recommendation list, shorten user’s time to wait for an answer and improve user experience as well.},

abstract = {Community Question Answering (cQA) are platforms where users can post their questions, expecting for other users to provide them with answers. We focus on the task of question retrieval in cQA which aims to retrieve previous questions that are similar to new queries. The past answers related to the similar questions can be therefore used to respond to the new queries. The major challenges in this task are the shortness of the questions and the word mismatch problem as users can formulate the same query using different wording. Although question retrieval has been widely studied over the years, it has received less attention in Arabic and still requires a non trivial endeavour. In this paper, we focus on this task both in Arabic and English. We propose to use word embeddings, which can capture semantic and syntactic information from contexts, to vectorize the questions. In order to get longer sequences, questions are expanded with words having close word vectors. The embedding vectors are fed into the Siamese LSTM model to consider the global context of questions. The similarity between the questions is measured using the Manhattan distance. Experiments on real world Yahoo! Answers dataset show the efficiency of the method in Arabic and English.},

abstract = {Google Search is where most developers start their Web journey looking for code examples to reuse. It is highly likely that code that is linked to the top results will be among those candidates that find their way into production software. However, as a large amount of secure and insecure code has been identified on the Web, the question arises how the providing webpages are ranked by Google and whether the ranking has an effect on software security. We investigate how secure and insecure cryptographic code examples from Stack Overflow are ranked by Google Search. Our results show that insecure code ends up in the top results and is clicked on more often. There is at least a 22.8\% chance that one out of the top three Google Search results leads to insecure code. We introduce security-based re-ranking, where the rank of Google Search is updated based on the security and relevance of the provided source code in the results. We tested our re-ranking approach and compared it to Google's original ranking in an online developer study. Participants that used our modified search engine to look for help online submitted more secure and functional results, with statistical significance. In contrast to prior work on helping developers to write secure code, security-based re-ranking completely eradicates the requirement for any action performed by developers. Our intervention remains completely invisible, and therefore the probability of adoption is greatly increased. We believe security-based re-ranking allows Internet-wide improvement of code security and prevents the far-reaching spread of insecure code found on the Web.},

abstract = {Background: In recent years, Low-code development (LCD) is growing rapidly, and Gartner and Forrester have predicted that the use of LCD is very promising. Giant companies, such as Microsoft, Mendix, and Outsystems have also launched their LCD platforms. Aim: In this work, we explored two popular online developer communities, Stack Overflow (SO) and Reddit, to provide insights on the characteristics and challenges of LCD from a practitioners' perspective. Method: We used two LCD related terms to search the relevant posts in SO and extracted 73 posts. Meanwhile, we explored three LCD related subreddits from Reddit and collected 228 posts. We extracted data from these posts and applied the Constant Comparison method to analyze the descriptions, benefits, and limitations and challenges of LCD. For platforms and programming languages used in LCD, implementation units in LCD, supporting technologies of LCD, types of applications developed by LCD, and domains that use LCD, we used descriptive statistics to analyze and present the results. Results: Our findings show that: (1) LCD may provide a graphical user interface for users to drag and drop with little or even no code; (2) the equipment of out-of-the-box units (e.g., APIs and components) in LCD platforms makes them easy to learn and use as well as speeds up the development; (3) LCD is particularly favored in the domains that have the need for automated processes and workflows; and (4) practitioners have conflicting views on the advantages and disadvantages of LCD. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that researchers should clearly define the terms when they refer to LCD, and developers should consider whether the characteristics of LCD are appropriate for their projects.},

abstract = {Code completion, one of the most useful features in the Integrated Development Environments (IDEs), can accelerate software development by suggesting the libraries, APIs, and method names in real-time. Recent studies have shown that statistical language models can improve the performance of code completion tools through learning from large-scale software repositories. However, these models suffer from three major drawbacks: a) The hierarchical structural information of the programs is not fully utilized in the program's representation; b) In programs, the semantic relationships can be very long. Existing recurrent neural networks based language models are not sufficient to model the long-term dependency. c) Existing approaches perform a specific task in one model, which leads to the underuse of the information from related tasks. To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose a self-attentional neural architecture for code completion with multi-task learning. To utilize the hierarchical structural information of the programs, we present a novel method that considers the path from the predicting node to the root node. To capture the long-term dependency in the input programs, we adopt a self-attentional architecture based network as the base language model. To enable the knowledge sharing between related tasks, we creatively propose a Multi-Task Learning (MTL) framework to learn two related tasks in code completion jointly. Experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our model when compared with state-of-the-art methods.},

Community detection algorithms are then useful to reveal the sub-structures of a network and in particular interest groups. Identifying these users' communities and the interests that bind them can help us assist their life-cycle. Certain kinds of online communities such as question-and-answer (Q&amp;A) sites or forums, have no explicit social network structure. Therefore, many traditional community detection techniques do not apply directly. In this paper, we propose TTD (Topic Trees Distributions) an efficient approach for extracting topic from Q&amp;A sites in order to detect communities of interest. Then we compare three detection methods we applied on a dataset extracted from the popular Q&amp;A site StackOverflow. Our method based on topic modeling and user membership assignment is shown to be much simpler and faster while preserving the quality of the detection.},

Like other software artifacts, code on SO evolves over time, for example when bugs are fixed or APIs are updated to the most recent version. To be able to analyze how code and the surrounding text on SO evolves, we built SOTorrent, an open dataset based on the official SO data dump. SOTorrent provides access to the version history of SO content at the level of whole posts and individual text and code blocks. It connects code snippets from SO posts to other platforms by aggregating URLs from surrounding text blocks and comments, and by collecting references from GitHub files to SO posts. Our vision is that researchers will use SOTorrent to investigate and understand the evolution and maintenance of code on SO and its relation to other platforms such as GitHub.},

abstract = {We perform cross-lingual question retrieval in community question answering (cQA), i.e., we retrieve similar questions for queries that are given in another language. The standard approach to cross-lingual information retrieval, which is to automatically translate the query to the target language and continue with a monolingual retrieval model, typically falls short in cQA due to translation errors. This is even more the case for specialized domains such as in technical cQA, which we explore in this work. To remedy, we propose two extensions to this approach that improve cross-lingual question retrieval: (1) we enhance an NMT model with monolingual cQA data to improve the translation quality, and (2) we improve the robustness of a state-of-the-art neural question retrieval model to common translation errors by adding back-translations during training. Our results show that we achieve substantial improvements over the baseline approach and considerably close the gap to a setup where we have access to an external commercial machine translation service (i.e., Google Translate), which is often not the case in many practical scenarios.

abstract = {Background: Automated unit and integration tests allow software development teams to continuously evaluate their application's behavior and ensure requirements are satisfied. Interest in explicitly testing security at the unit and integration levels has risen as more teams begin to shift security left in their workflows, but there is little insight into any potential pain points developers may experience as they learn to adapt their existing skills to write these tests. Aims: Identify security unit and integration testing pain points that could negatively impact efforts to shift security (testing) left to this level. Method: An mixed-method empirical study was conducted on 525 Stack Overflow and Security Stack Exchange posts related to security unit and integration testing. Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) was applied to identify commonly discussed topics, pain points were learned through qualitative analysis, and links were analyzed to study commonly-shared resources. Results: Nine topics representing security controls, components, and scenarios were identified; Authentication was the most commonly tested control. Developers experienced seven pain points unique to security unit and integration testing, which were all influenced by the complexity of security control designs and implementations. Most linked resources were other Q&amp;A posts, but repositories and documentation for security tools and libraries were also common. Conclusions: Developers may experience several unique pain points when writing tests at this level involving security controls. Additional resources are needed to guide developers through these challenges, which should also influence the creation of strategies and tools to help shift security testing to this level. To accelerate this, actionable recommendations for practitioners and future research directions based on these findings are highlighted.},

The aim is to identify non-contact teaching in education and which educational processes can be useful.The research methodology includes several methods that enable a triangular analysis, i.e., the analysis of bibliographic records in the Web of Science database, on-the-desk analysis of selected secondary sources, a focus group, and one narrative case. Information concerning university reactions to COVID-19 was collected by analyzing news and websites in Russia, in the CR, done a focus group interview, and further one unstructured interview for writing one narrative case. Both authors apply auto-narrative reflections to describe the environment at their universities and use their long-term experience with teaching and personal observations during the pandemic.Findings show educational processes at two universities in Russia and the CR in time when the universities transformed the traditional teaching to distance one. Teachers and students quickly mastered the transition; however, weaknesses and threats arose concerning undeveloped teaching methods for online education, the evaluation system of students' performance, managing the work-life balance of staff, and the quality of Internet communication.Based on university reactions and primary data, the authors believe that the future research must focus on the improvement of online teaching methods, re-design of students' performance management, a change of human resource management at universities, global knowledge sharing of best practices among universities, and the social responsibility of universities in the area of public digital competence.},

During the last decade, many studies are carried out to address these problems, however, careful examination of these works suggests that there's a potential research gap. This paper has performed a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) to identify the most significant/commonly studied challenges of requirement change management process and furthermore this process under GSD context. We identified ten challenges such as impact analysis, cost estimation, artifacts documents management, requirement traceability, requirements dependency, conflicts with existing requirements, time estimation, change prioritization, user involvement, and system destabilizing. Furthermore, three challenges such as communication and coordination, knowledge sharing, management, and Change Control Board (CCB) management are identified for globally distributed projects. We also mapped these identified challenges to Requirement Change Management Process (RCMP) outcomes proposed in our previous study. We believe that mapping between RCM challenges and RCMP outcomes will enhance the practical significance of this study results. Considering the systematic literature review results, we suggest that there is a need to develop a framework for requirement change management for quality software systems development.},

abstract = {Bug triaging, i.e.,\"{\i} \'{z}assigning a bug report to the "best" person to address it, involves identifying a list of developers that are qualified to understand and address the bug report, and then ranking them according to their expertise. Most research in this area examines the description of the bug report and the developers' prior development and bug-fixing activities. In this paper, we propose a novel method that exploits a new source of evidence for the developers' expertise, namely their contributions in Stack Overflow, the popular software Question and Answer Q&amp;A platform. The key intuition of our method is that the questions a developer asks and answers in Stack Overflow, or more generally in software Q&amp;A platforms, can potentially be an excellent indicator of his/her expertise. Motivated by this idea, our method uses the bug-report description as a guide for selecting relevant Stack Overflow\"{\i} \'{z}contributions on the basis of which to identify developers with the necessary expertise to close the bug under examination. We evaluated this method in the context of the 20 largest GitHub\"{\i} \'{z}projects, considering 7144 bug reports. Our results demonstrate that our method exhibits superior accuracy to other state-of-the-art methods.},

abstract = {Online peer production communities, such as Wikipedia, Yahoo Answers, and Stack Overflow, not only generate knowledge resources with low cost access, but also have tremendous potential to complement both online and offline movement of societies. As peer production communities flourished, merely describing successful cases has become less useful. Instead, scholars must identify the dynamics, structures, and conditions that contribute to or impede that success, including how communities change, what makes some communities succeed while others fail, and how and when to intervene successfully. In this dissertation project I combine Activity Theory, computational techniques, and qualitative and quantitative methods to understand the differences of dynamics, structures, and conditions of two social Q&amp;A communities that produced contrasting results within the same context, based on the community life cycle.},

abstract = {Completing knowledge bases (KBs) with missing facts is of great importance, since most existing KBs are far from complete. To this end, many knowledge base completion (KBC) methods have been proposed. However, most existing methods embed each relation into a vector separately, while ignoring the correlations among different relations. Actually, in large-scale KBs, there always exist some relations that are semantically related, and we believe this can help to facilitate the knowledge sharing when learning the embedding of related relations simultaneously. Along this line, we propose a novel KBC model by Multi -Task E mbedding, named MultiE. In this model, semantically related relations are first clustered into the same group, and then learning the embedding of each relation can leverage the knowledge among different relations. Moreover, we propose a three-layer network to predict the missing values of incomplete knowledge triples. Finally, experiments on three popular benchmarks FB15k, FB15k-237 and WN18 are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of MultiE against some state-of-the-art baseline competitors.},

abstract = {Online discussion forums are being increasingly used in classrooms as a way to encourage collaborative learning and community. Piazza is one such forum that was built specifically for academic institutions, and has been widely adopted. Students have the opportunity to ask questions and seek answers from peers and instructors alike online, allowing them to find the information they need even if they do not know fellow students in the class or if they cannot make an instructor's office hours. However, recent analysis of the popular online discussion site Stack Overflow, suggests that women are more likely than men to withdraw from such a community if they do not identify other members of the same gender. Women are often a minority in computer science courses and may express difficulty interacting with or seeking help from their peers who are predominantly men. Considering the importance of providing equal access to students regardless of gender and the value of resources like Piazza in one's education, it is imperative to assess the representation and impact of gender on Piazza. We analyzed data from over 2,500 Piazza users across three computer science courses at the University of Virginia and found that women on Piazza post more questions than men, spend more time on the discussion site, and achieve higher reputation scores on average. However, they are more likely than men to both ask and answer questions anonymously and less likely to receive responses from members of the same gender.},

The deployments of Web 2.0 have created lot of impacts on enterprise KM sharing and reuse. Web 2.0 is used as platforms to improve ties in social networks as well as knowledge sharing and reuse activities in organizations. Many studies have shown that adoption of technologies in organizations is not the only success factor for enterprises knowledge creation and sharing among employees. Other factors such as organizational culture, man power, benefit schemes, budget and policy [33] in organizations are equally important. They should be considered to ensure the implementation of knowledge creation and sharing in organization is a successful one. This research intends to propose a Web 2.0 Affectivity model that focuses on the role of a Affect which may be able to improve the acceptance of Web 2.0 as tools for organizational knowledge sharing and reuse.

A set of questionnaires measuring cultural values, and scenarios engendering different types of relationships among group members were conducted with students from China, United States, Kingdom of Bahrain and from the Kingdom of Thailand. The results show some cultural differences in term of knowledge sharing intensity and preferences. This suggests that global organizations should manage their knowledge sharing environment and strategy in different ways in different parts of the world if they want to maximize its benefits. There is a direct implication of this research on the usage of knowledge management technologies, since for instance, the participation in online communities of practices for employees of multinational corporations is directly affected by cultural values.},

Data were collected from 113 members of 13 virtual student teams consisting of participants from Asia and Europe. Contrary to the team-member exchange theory, the findings suggest that, in GVTs, exchange ideology negatively moderates the relationships between extrinsic rewards, reciprocity and knowledge sharing, and had no moderating effect on the relationship between image and knowledge sharing. These results provoke theoretical implications that some contextual factors of GVTs may influence the moderating effects of individual difference. This study also provides some suggestions for the management of GVTs in knowledge sharing encouragement.},

Two coding schemes are built for investigating distribution of knowledge and interaction during task transfer. Results show that knowledge is distributed among human, artifacts, and the working environment. Moreover, bidirectional interaction between task transmitter and recipient is beneficial for knowledge sharing. The role of this triangular relationship and needs for interaction during task transfer for dyads are highlighted and discussed.},

Interactive online help systems are considered to be a fruitful supplement to traditional support systems. The paper at hand proposes a conceptual frame for this alternative, based on knowledge sharing in communities of practice (CoPs). A literature review is done bringing together theoretical issues and recent research from the fields of CoPs and academic help seeking. Both approaches are well represented in the empirical research literature. While they are complementary, hence compatible to each other, their combination is not yet sufficiently explored from the psychological and educational point of view. To explore and foster help-seeking in CoPs, we developed a help system based on active participation and knowledge sharing between CoP members. The empirical part of this paper presents the evaluation of the help system, which is based on acceptance theories. The evaluation results are encouraging, and suggest possibilities of further development of the help system in the CoP context, as well as means to foster CoPs and support knowledge sharing.},

Software projects are spread across multiple geographies and tools are deployed globally in these organizations. Global tool deployment is often motivated by an attractive enterprise cost of the tool. Moreover, it helps in harmonizing practices across development groups and useful in establishing benchmarks without further normalizations. There are various parameters to drive a successful tool deployment in a global setup. For example, a good roll out plan, knowledge sharing platform, coordination and trust building among the change agents from different geographies, and a good central support. In this paper, we present our experience of a global roll out of a software engineering tool in a large organization. It has been observed that besides tool's features, factors such as knowledge sharing, active feedback, and training plays an important role in an effective tool deployment.},

abstract = {Background: Code smells indicate potential design or implementation problems that may have a negative impact on programs. Similar to other software artefacts, developers use Stack Overflow (SO) to ask questions about code smells. However, given the high number of questions asked on the platform, and the limitations of the default tagging system, it takes significant effort to extract knowledge about code smells by means of manual approaches. Aim: We utilized supervised machine learning techniques to automatically identify code-smell discussions from SO posts. Method: We conducted an experiment using a manually labeled dataset that contains 3000 code-smell and 3000 non-code-smell posts to evaluate the performance of different classifiers when automatically identifying code smell discussions. Results: Our results show that Logistic Regression (LR) with parameter C=20 (inverse of regularization strength) and Bag of Words (BoW) feature extraction technique achieved the best performance amongst the algorithms we evaluated with a precision of 0.978, a recall of 0.965, and an F1-score of 0.971. Conclusion: Our results show that machine learning approach can effectively locate code-smell posts even if posts' title and/or tags cannot be of help. The technique can be used to extract code smell discussions from other textual artefacts (e.g., code reviews), and promisingly to extract SO discussions of other topics.},

abstract = {Inter-team knowledge sharing is an important aspect of agile software development because it allows agility to be scaled to an entire organization. However, achieving inter-team knowledge sharing is not easy because the practices that allow it to happen are poorly reported In The literature. As a consequence, many Agile Software organizations find It difficult to share Experiences and best practices in their contexts, as well as improve employees' skills and expertise. Results from our previous qualitative Studies enabled us to generate A pattern language that aims to help agile Software organizations to adopt practices for fostering interaction among Agile teams in order to share knowledge Across teams and create collective knowledge. This paper contributes to the Agile Software development and knowledge management fields with practical guidance to organizations aiming those Improvements. "Because of space limitations, we describe only five patterns of the pattern language In This paper, which are briefly presented as follows. Open Workspace helps to stimulate face-to-face conversations across teams. Rotation of Teams' Members is a practice about transferring of professionals to other teams in order to spread technical, methodological and management solutions in a sustainable way. Pair Programming among Different Teams are specially adopted to level technical knowledge throughout the company. Collective Meetings foster inter-team communication and alignment about company's projects and goals. Finally, Technical Presentations Stimulate continuous learning and knowledge sharing behaviour. It is important to note that the adoption of the pattern language is affected by forces, such as organizational culture, environment, and top management and leadership support. These forces need to balanced to facilitate and/or reinforce the patterns.},

abstract = {Software design patterns are solutions to common software problems that are proven to work adequately in particular scenarios. Deciding which design pattern to use for a given software problem often requires practical knowledge acquired with experience in a similar domain and can be highly subjective and error-prone. Further, for novice programmers, an automated approach would be of tremendous help as it would provide practical knowledge required for deciding which design pattern to use for a particular software problem. The majority of research in software design pattern prediction involves using software structure and features in determining which design pattern to implement. However, there are circumstances where software engineers would prefer to know which design pattern to be used by looking at the design problem during or before the implementation phase. Existing design pattern prediction tools cannot be utilized in this scenario due to the absence of code and class structures. To address this issue, this paper proposes a new approach that analyzes the context of the software problem from text and predicts a suitable design pattern for the given problem context using feature learning, neural embedding, and classification. We evaluate our approach on a case study from Stack Overflow with more than 66,000 questions that discuss problems and consequences related to 23 design patterns. Results show that our approach can predict design patterns from the text with 82\% overall accuracy.},

abstract = {Multi-participant chat conversations are one of the most frequently employed Computer Supported Collaborative Learning tools due to their ease of use. Moreover, chats enhance knowledge sharing, sustain creativity and aid in collaborative problem solving. Nevertheless, the manual analysis of multi-participant chats is a difficult task due to the mixture of different topics and the inter-twinning of multiple discussion threads during the same conversation. Several tools that employ Natural Language Processing techniques have been developed to automatically identify links between contributions in order to facilitate the tracking of topics and of discussion threads, as well as to highlight key contributions in terms of follow-up impact. This paper proposes a novel method for detecting implicit links based on features computed using string kernels and word embeddings, combined with neural networks. This method significantly outperforms previous results on the same dataset. Due to its smaller size, our model represents an alternative to more complex deep neural networks, especially when limited training data is available as is the case of CSCL chats in a specific domain.},

abstract = {The paper presents a software architecture allowing a robot to learn new compositions of objects in table-top scenarios by human demonstrations. The robot qualitatively represents those scenes, reason upon their similarity, and interact with humans through dialogues to talk about represented scenes. We formalise the robot behaviour based on a Description Logic representation of scenes through spatial beliefs, i.e., learned logic predicates, on which the robot applies symbolic reasoning to recognise and explain the scene. We exploit the logical structure of predicates in a software architecture that enables a robot exposing its beliefs, and if required, it allows a human supervisor to apply corrections in a form akin to robot active perception. The paper critically discusses the design of the software components and their interfaces, discriminating between knowledge representation and dialogue management. Those components are developed for human-robot knowledge sharing applications involving visual, verbal, and auditory modalities of interaction. Software components are treated as grey boxes managing an ontology-based formalisation of robot beliefs through four contextualised dialogues, for which we present a unique design pattern.},

abstract = {Question retrieval is a crucial subtask for community question answering. Previous research focus on supervised models which depend heavily on training data and manual feature engineering. In this paper, we propose a novel unsu-pervised framework, namely reduced attentive matching network (RAMN), to compute semantic matching between two questions. Our RAMN integrates together the deep semantic representations, the shallow lexical mismatching information and the initial rank produced by an external search engine. For the first time, we propose attention autoencoders to generate semantic representations of questions. In addition, we employ lexical mismatching to capture surface matching between two questions, which is derived from the importance of each word in a question. We conduct experiments on the open CQA datasets of SemEval-2016 and SemEval-2017. The experimental results show that our unsupervised model obtains comparable performance with the state-of-the-art supervised methods in SemEval-2016 Task 3, and outperforms the best system in SemEval-2017 Task 3 by a wide margin.},

abstract = {In recent years, Community Question Answering (CQA) has emerged as a popular platform for knowledge curation and archival. An interesting aspect of question answering is that it combines aspects from natural language processing, information retrieval, and machine learning. In this paper, we have explored how the depth of the neural network influences the accuracy of prediction of deleted questions in question-answering forums. We have used different shallow and deep models for prediction and analyzed the relationships between number of hidden layers, accuracy, and computational time. The results suggest that while deep networks perform better than shallow networks in modeling complex non-linear functions, increasing the depth may not always produce desired results. We observe that the performance of the deep neural network suffers significantly due to vanishing gradients when large number of hidden layers are present. Constantly increasing the depth of the model increases accuracy initially, after which the accuracy plateaus, and finally drops. Adding each layer is also expensive in terms of the time required to train the model. This research is situated in the domain of neural information retrieval and contributes towards building a theory on how deep neural networks can be efficiently and accurately used for predicting question deletion. We predict deleted questions with more than 90\% accuracy using two to ten hidden layers, with less accurate results for shallower and deeper architectures.},

abstract = {Tacit knowledge provides an important support to enterprise activities; software development is not an exception. Traditionally, tacit knowledge is communicated face-to-face while performing activities; in distributed environments it is difficult to carry out. On the other hand, documenting tacit knowledge becomes a difficult task due to its informal nature. Several efforts have been made in order to document tacit knowledge, but some challenges remain. Nowadays, social media provide possibilities for communicating knowledge and are a substantive source of tacit knowledge generation. In this paper we present a case study about how we are using Facebook to supervise the project performance and for integrating a tacit knowledge repository. This repository will allow us to assess future projects at the level of team performance, knowledge sharing, and project success factors. Based on the characterization of tacit knowledge sharing through Facebook, we present an initial proposal to use uncertainty reasoning to predict the project success and for classifying the messages that express tacit knowledge.},

abstract = {Community question-answering (CQA) has been established as a prominent web service enabling users to post questions and get answers from the community. Product Question Answering (PQA) is a special CQA framework where questions are asked (and are answered) in the context of a specific product. Naturally, humorous questions are integral part of such platforms, especially as some products attract humor due to their unreasonable price, their peculiar functionality, or in cases that users emphasize their critical point-of-view through humor. Detecting humorous questions in such systems is important for sellers, to better understand user engagement with their products. It is also important to signal users about flippancy of humorous questions, and that answers for such questions should be taken with a grain of salt.In this study we present a deep-learning framework for detecting humorous questions in PQA systems. Our framework utilizes two properties of the questions - Incongruity and Subjectivity, demonstrating their contribution for humor detection. We evaluate our framework over a real-world dataset, demonstrating an accuracy of 90.8\%, up to 18.3\% relative improvement over baseline methods. We then demonstrate the existence of product bias in PQA platforms, when some products attract more humorous questions than others. A classifier trained over unbiased data is outperformed by the biased classifier, however, it excels in the task of differentiating between humorous and non-humorous questions that are both related to the same product. To the best of our knowledge this work is the first to detect humor in PQA setting.},

abstract = {Developers spend a significant portion of their time searching for solutions and methods online. While numerous tools have been developed to support this exploratory process, in many cases the answers to developers' questions involve trade-offs among multiple valid options and not just a single solution. Through interviews, we discovered that developers express a desire for help with decision-making and understanding trade-offs. Through an analysis of Stack Overflow posts, we observed that many answers describe such trade-offs. These findings suggest that tools designed to help a developer capture information and make decisions about trade-offs can provide crucial benefits for both the developers and others who want to understand their design rationale. In this work, we probe this hypothesis with a prototype system named Unakite that collects, organizes, and keeps track of information about trade-offs and builds a comparison table, which can be saved as a design rationale for later use. Our evaluation results show that Unakite reduces the cost of capturing tradeoff-related information by 45\%, and that the resulting comparison table speeds up a subsequent developer's ability to understand the trade-offs by about a factor of three.},

abstract = {To analyze large-scale data efficiently, developers have created various big data processing frameworks (e.g., Apache Spark). These big data processing frameworks provide abstractions to developers so that they can focus on implementing the data analysis logic. In traditional software systems, developers leverage logging to monitor applications and record intermediate states to assist workload understanding and issue diagnosis. However, due to the abstraction and the peculiarity of big data frameworks, there is currently no effective monitoring approach for big data applications. In this paper, we first manually study 1,000 randomly sampled Spark-related questions on Stack Overflow to study their root causes and the type of information, if recorded, that can assist developers with motioning and diagnosis. Then, we design an approach, DPLOG, which assists developers with monitoring Spark applications. DPLOG leverages statistical sampling to minimize performance overhead and provides intermediate information and hint/warning messages for each data processing step of a chained method pipeline. We evaluate DPLOG on six benchmarking programs and find that DPLOG has a relatively small overhead (i.e., less than 10\% increase in response time when processing 5GB data) compared to without using DPLOG, and reduce the overhead by over 500\% compared to the baseline. Our user study with 20 developers shows that DPLOG can reduce the needed time to debug big data applications by 63\% and the participants give DPLOG an average of 4.85/5 for its usefulness. The idea of DPLOG may be applied to other big data processing frameworks, and our study sheds light on future research opportunities in assisting developers with monitoring big data applications.},

abstract = {This paper presents the analysis and key findings of a survey on architectural knowledge sharing. The responses of 97 architects working in the Dutch IT Industry were analyzed by correlating practices and challenges with project size and success. Impact mechanisms between project size, project success, and architectural knowledge sharing practices and challenges were deduced based on reasoning, experience and literature. We find that architects run into numerous and diverse challenges sharing architectural knowledge, but that the only challenges that have a significant impact are the emotional challenges related to interpersonal relationships. Thus, architects should be careful when dealing with emotions in knowledge sharing.},

abstract = {In the CQA (Community Question Answering) systems, expert finding is one of the most important subjects. The task of expert finding is aimed at discovering users with relevant expertise or experience for a given question. However, with the increasing amount of information in CQA platform, the questioner has to wait for a long time for the response of other users, and the quality of the answers that user receive is not optimistic. In view of the above problems, this paper proposes the Topic Professional Level Model (TPLM) to find the right experts for questions. The model combines both the topic model and the professional level model respectively from the two perspectives of semantic topic of textual content and link structure to calculate the user’s authority under a specific topic. Based on TPLM results, this paper proposed the TPLMRank algorithm to measure user comprehensive score to find the expert users. The experimental results on the Chinese CQA platform-Zhihu dataset show that the expert finding method based on the TPLM is superior to the traditional expert finding method.},

abstract = {Deep learning (DL) is moving its step into a growing number of mobile software applications. These software applications, named as DL based mobile applications (abbreviated as mobile DL apps) integrate DL models trained using large-scale data with DL programs. A DL program encodes the structure of a desirable DL model and the process by which the model is trained using training data. Due to the increasing dependency of current mobile apps on DL, software engineering (SE) for mobile DL apps has become important. However, existing efforts in SE research community mainly focus on the development of DL models and extensively analyze faults in DL programs. In contrast, faults related to the deployment of DL models on mobile devices (named as deployment faults of mobile DL apps) have not been well studied. Since mobile DL apps have been used by billions of end users daily for various purposes including for safety-critical scenarios, characterizing their deployment faults is of enormous importance. To fill in the knowledge gap, this paper presents the first comprehensive study to date on the deployment faults of mobile DL apps. We identify 304 real deployment faults from Stack Overflow and GitHub, two commonly used data sources for studying software faults. Based on the identified faults, we construct a fine-granularity taxonomy consisting of 23 categories regarding to fault symptoms and distill common fix strategies for different fault symptoms. Furthermore, we suggest actionable implications and research avenues that can potentially facilitate the deployment of DL models on mobile devices.},

abstract = {Answers submitted to CQA forums are often elaborate, contain spam, are marred by slurs and business promotions. It is difficult for a reader to go through numerous such answers to gauge community opinion. As a result summarization becomes a prioritized task. However, there is a dearth of neural approaches for CQA summarization due to the lack of large scale annotated dataset. We create CQASUMM, the first annotated CQA summarization dataset by filtering the 4.4 million Yahoo! Answers L6 dataset. We sample threads where the best answer can double up as a reference and build hundred word summaries from them. We provide scripts1 to reconstruct the dataset and introduce the new task of Community Question Answering Summarization.Multi document summarization(MDS) has been widely studied using news corpora. However documents in CQA have higher variance and contradicting opinion. We compare the popular MDS techniques and evaluate their performance on our CQA corpora. We find that most MDS workflows are built for the entirely factual news corpora, whereas our corpus has a fair share of opinion based instances too. We therefore introduce OpinioSumm, a new MDS which outperforms the best baseline by 4.6\% w.r.t ROUGE-1 score.},

abstract = {WebAssembly is an increasingly popular compilation target designed to run code in browsers and on other platforms safely and securely, by strictly separating code and data, enforcing types, and limiting indirect control flow. Still, vulnerabilities in memory-unsafe source languages can translate to vulnerabilities in WebAssembly binaries. In this paper, we analyze to what extent vulnerabilities are exploitable in WebAssembly binaries, and how this compares to native code. We find that many classic vulnerabilities which, due to common mitigations, are no longer exploitable in native binaries, are completely exposed in WebAssembly. Moreover, WebAssembly enables unique attacks, such as overwriting supposedly constant data or manipulating the heap using a stack overflow. We present a set of attack primitives that enable an attacker (i) to write arbitrary memory, (ii) to overwrite sensitive data, and (iii) to trigger unexpected behavior by diverting control flow or manipulating the host environment. We provide a set of vulnerable proof-of-concept applications along with complete end-to-end exploits, which cover three WebAssembly platforms. An empirical risk assessment on real-world binaries and SPEC CPU programs compiled to WebAssembly shows that our attack primitives are likely to be feasible in practice. Overall, our findings show a perhaps surprising lack of binary security in WebAssembly. We discuss potential protection mechanisms to mitigate the resulting risks.},

abstract = {Stack Overflow is widely regarded as the most popular Community driven Question Answering (CQA) website for programmers. Questions posted on Stack Overflow which are not related to programming topics, are marked as `closed' by experienced users and community moderators. A question can be `closed' for five reasons -- duplicate, off-topic, subjective, not a real question and too localized. In this work, we present the first study of `closed' questions on Stack Overflow. We download 4 years of publicly available data which contains 3.4 Million questions. We first analyze and characterize the complete set of 0.1 Million `closed' questions. Next, we use a machine learning framework and build a predictive model to identify a `closed' question at the time of question creation.One of our key findings is that despite being marked as `closed', subjective questions contain high information value and are very popular with the users. We observe an increasing trend in the percentage of closed questions over time and find that this increase is positively correlated to the number of newly registered users. In addition, we also see a decrease in community participation to mark a `closed' question which has led to an increase in moderation job time. We also find that questions closed with the Duplicate and Off Topic labels are relatively more prone to reputation gaming. Our analysis suggests broader implications for content quality maintenance on CQA websites. For the `closed' question prediction task, we make use of multiple genres of feature sets based on - user profile, community process, textual style and question content. We use a state-of-art machine learning classifier based on an ensemble framework and achieve an overall accuracy of 70.3\%. Analysis of the feature space reveals that `closed' questions are relatively less informative and descriptive than non-`closed' questions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first experimental study to analyze and predict `closed' questions on Stack Overflow.},

abstract = {National Science Foundation large facilities conduct large-scale physical and natural science research. They include telescopes that survey the entire sky, gravitational wave detectors that look deep into our universe’s past, sensor-driven field sites that collect a range of biological and environmental data, and more. The Cyberinfrastructure Center for Excellence (CICoE) pilot project aims to develop a model for a center that facilitates community building, fosters knowledge sharing, and applies best practices in consulting with large facilities with regard to their cyberinfrastructure. To accomplish this goal, the pilot began an in-depth study of how large facilities manage their data during the course of their research. Large facilities are diverse and highly complex, from the types of data they capture, to the types of equipment they use, to the types of data processing and analysis they conduct, to their policies on data sharing and use. Because of this complexity, the pilot needed to find a single lens through which it could frame its growing understanding of large facilities and identify areas where it could best serve large facilities. As a result of the pilot’s research into large facilities, common themes have emerged which have enabled the creation of a data lifecycle model that successfully captures the data management practices of large facilities. This model has enabled the pilot to organize its thinking about large facilities, and frame its support and consultation efforts around the cyberinfrastructure used during lifecycle stages. This paper describes the model and discusses how it was applied to disaster recovery planning for a representative large facility—IceCube.},

Our results illustrate newcomers' diverse needs, perceptions, and help-seeking behaviors. We found a number of distinctions in how technical and non-technical users approached help-seeking, including: when and how they initiated the help-seeking process, their struggles in recognizing relevant help, the degree to which they made coordinated use of the application and different resources, and in how they perceived the utility of different help formats. We discuss implications for moving beyond "one-size-fits-all" help resources towards more structured, personalized, and curated help and learning materials.},

However, the co-presence of instructor and potential learners is missing when experts pre-produce how-to tutorials or videos offline. Hence, the content being shared by experts may not meet future learners' needs. To ensure the instructional value of archived tutorials for future learners, we explored ways to improve content production by analyzing interactive social prompts from a social partner during the time when experts share knowledge. We paired experts with partners of varying expertise and asked them to freely interact with the experts along the process. To simulate sharing knowledge via video-recording, a cooking task was deployed and we asked cooking experts to think-aloud while executing a cooking task with feedback from one of three types of paired partners, including another cooking expert, a novice, or no partner. This study identified six types of social prompts that can inform the design of computer-mediated knowledge sharing. Moreover, content quality was rated and evaluated, which shows that the best when knowledge was shared with the aid of expert's prompts. This study provides understanding of how various types of social prompts affect the externalization of how-to knowledge for asynchronous knowledge transfer between experts and future learners.},

In this paper, we investigate how often GitHub developers re-use code snippets from the SO forum, as well as what concepts they are more likely to reference in their code. To accomplish our goal, we mine SOTorrent dataset that provides connectivity between code snippets on the SO posts with software projects hosted on GitHub. We then study the characteristics of GitHub projects that reference SO posts and discover popular SO discussions that happen in GitHub projects. Our results demonstrate that on average developers make 45 references to SO posts in their projects, with the highest number of references being made within the JavaScript code. We also found that 79\% of the SO posts with code snippets that are referenced in GitHub code do change over time (at least ones) raising code maintainability and reliability concerns.},

abstract = {Community Question Answering (CQA) sites such as Yahoo! Answers and Baidu Knows have emerged as rich knowledge resources for information seekers. However, answers posted to CQA sites often vary a lot in their qualities. User votes from the community may partially reflect the overall quality of the answer, but they are often missing. Hence, automatic selection of "good'' answers becomes a practical research problem that will help us manage the quality of accumulated knowledge. Without loss of generality, a good answer should deliver not only relevant but also trustworthy information that can help resolve the information needs of the posted question, but the latter has received less investigation in the past. In this paper, we propose a novel matching-verification framework for automatic answer selection. The matching component assesses the relevance of a candidate answer to a given question as conventional QA methods. The major enhancement is the verification component, which aims to leverage the wisdom of crowds, e.g., some big information repository, for trustworthiness measurement. Given a question, we take the top retrieved results from the information repository as the supporting evidences to distill the consensus representation. A major challenge is that there is no guarantee that one can always obtain reliable consensus from the wisdom of crowds for a question due to the noisy nature and the limitation of the existing search technology.Therefore, we decompose the trustworthiness measurement into two parts, i.e., a verification score which measures the consistency between a candidate answer and the consensus representation, and a confidence score which measures the reliability of the consensus itself. Empirical studies on three real-world CQA data collections, i.e. YahooQA, QuoraQA and AmazonQA, show that our approach can significantly outperform the state-of-the-art methods on the answer selection task.},

abstract = {The purpose of this research is to examine knowledge-sharing in organizations from a number of aspects, including innovation culture, roles, structure, and teamwork and leadership creativity.&lt;Emphasis Type="Bold"&gt;A&lt;/Emphasis&gt;survey was conducted of 100 Greek firms and we interviewed top and bottom management using a questionnaire which comprised twenty-eight questions divided into five categories. Most organizations appeared to have a knowledge system but its existence does not guarantee its use. This can be largely attributed to the fact that knowledge-sharing initiatives are preoccupied with technology infrastructure as the basic knowledge-sharing enabler. Most of them fail to focus on the individuals who engage in knowledge-sharing. It was found that resistance by management and employees was a critically important factor influencing the success or otherwise of organizational knowledge efforts. Knowledge-sharing is difficult to accomplish in such circumstances According to our cluster analysis, two types of firms are identified: those which have benefited from KM to invest in innovative strategies, and those which have not.},

abstract = {Interorganizational knowledge sharing is critical to knowledge intensive collaborations between organizations. Despite a proliferation of literature on knowledge sharing, most studies focused on such practice within an organization. The question of how to achieve effective interorganizational knowledge sharing remains unanswered. This study intends to answer this research question using the results from a case study of a software implementation project. Collaboration between software vendors and clients in information systems development/implementation projects require considerable amount of knowledge exchange between the partners. Differences in organizational culture, knowledge domain, as well as other critical factors, pose major challenge for inter-organizational knowledge sharing. To be able to observe the impact of these critical factors on interorganizational knowledge sharing, the knowledge sharing processes between organizations should first be thoroughly explored. While effectiveness of knowledge sharing may be viewed from different theoretical disciplines, we draw our analysis based on organizational learning perspective.},

However, our understanding on what factors and how these factors drive an individual's knowledge creation, knowledge sharing, and knowledge application activities is still limited. This paper explores the influence of the cognitive nature of the task and the psychological empowerment of the individuals on the extent to which an individual engages in the creation, sharing, and application of knowledge. A model of how the nature of the task and the empowerment of knowledge workers are related to an individual's knowledge management practices is proposed and tested with structural equation modeling approach. The results suggest that the cognitive nature of the task drives knowledge creation. While the psychological empowerment of the knowledge worker enhances knowledge sharing and application, empowerment is not linked to knowledge creation.},

abstract = {beginabstract We analyze comparative questions, i.e., questions asking to compare different items, that were submitted to Yandex in 2012. Responses to such questions might be quite different from the simple "ten blue links'' and could, for example, aggregate pros and cons of the different options as direct answers. However, changing the result presentation is an intricate decision such that the classification of comparative questions forms a highly precision-oriented task.  From a year-long Yandex log, we annotate a random sample of 50,000~questions; 2.8\%~of which are comparative. For these annotated questions, we develop a precision-oriented classifier by combining carefully hand-crafted lexico-syntactic rules with feature-based and neural approaches---achieving a recall of~0.6 at a perfect precision of~1.0. After running the classifier on the full year log (on average, there is at least one comparative question per second), we analyze 6,250~comparative questions using more fine-grained subclasses (e.g., should the answer be a "simple'' fact or rather a more verbose argument) for which individual classifiers are trained. An important insight is that more than 65\%~of the comparative questions demand argumentation and opinions, i.e., reliable direct answers to comparative questions require more than the facts from a search engine's knowledge graph.  In addition, we present a qualitative analysis of the underlying comparative information needs (separated into 14~categories likeconsumer electronics orhealth ), their seasonal dynamics, and possible answers from community question answering platforms. endabstract},

abstract = {With the rapid development of the Internet, community question answering (CQA) platforms have attracted increasing attention over recent years, particularly in the biomedical field. On biomedical CQA platforms, patients share information about diseases, drugs and symptoms by communicating with each other. Therefore, the biomedical CQA platforms become particularly valuable resources for information and knowledge acquisition of patients. To accurately acquire relevant information, question answering techniques have been introduced in biomedical CQA. However, existing approaches cannot achieve the ideal performance due to the domain-specific characteristics. For example, biomedical CQA involves more complex interactive information between askers and answerers, while CQA techniques designed for the general field can only deal with single interactions between questions and candidate answers within a similar topic. To address the problem, we propose a novel neural network model for biomedical CQA. Our model adopts the bidirectional capsule network to focus on different aspects of biomedical questions and candidate answers, and merges high-level vector representations of questions and answers to capture abundant semantic information. Furthermore, to capture the meaning of Chinese characters, we incorporate the radical of Chinese characters embedding as auxiliary information to improve the performance of Chinese biomedical CQA. We conduct extensive experiments, and demonstrate that our model achieves significant improvement on the performance of answer selection in the Chinese biomedical CQA task.},

Identifying topical opinion leaders who are both expert and influential in SCQA becomes a hot research topic. However, existing works focus on either using knowledge expertise to find experts for improving the quality of answers, or measuring user influence to identify influential ones. In this paper, we propose QALeaderRank, a topical opinion leader identification framework, incorporating both the topic-sensitive influence and the topical knowledge expertise. To measure a user’s topic-sensitive influence, we design a novel ranking algorithm that exploits both the social and QA features of SCQA, taking account of the network structure, topical similarity and knowledge authority. Besides, we incorporate three topic-relevant metrics to infer the topical expertise. Extensive experiments along with a user study demonstrate that QALeaderRank outperforms the compared state-of-the-art methods. QALeaderRank can also be used to identify multi-topic opinion leaders.},

As a natural enhancement of interleaving evaluation, multileaving merges more than two input rankings into one and measures the search user satisfaction of each input ranking on the basis of user clicks on the multileaved ranking. We evaluated the adequateness of two major multileaving methods, team draft multileaving (TDM) and optimized multileaving (OM), proposing their practical implementation for live services. Our experimental results demonstrated that multileaving methods could precisely evaluate the effectiveness of five rankings with different quality by using clicks from real users. Moreover, we concluded that OM is more efficient than TDM by observing that most of the evaluation results with OM converged after showing multileaved rankings around 40,000 times and an in-depth analysis of their characteristics.},

abstract = {Prior studies have demonstrated that approaches to generate an answer summary for a given technical query in Software Question and Answer (SQA) sites are desired. We find that existing approaches are assessed solely through user studies. Hence, a new user study needs to be performed every time a new approach is introduced; this is time-consuming, slows down the development of the new approach, and results from different user studies may not be comparable to each other. There is a need for a benchmark with ground truth summaries as a complement assessment through user studies. Unfortunately, such a benchmark is non-existent for answer summarization for technical queries from SQA sites. To fill the gap, we manually construct a high-quality benchmark to enable automatic evaluation of answer summarization for the technical queries for SQA sites. It contains 111 query-summary pairs extracted from 382 Stack Overflow answers with 2,014 sentence candidates. Using the benchmark, we comprehensively evaluate the performance of existing approaches and find that there is still a big room for improvements.Motivated by the results, we propose a new approach TechSumBot with three key modules:1) Usefulness Ranking module; 2) Centrality Estimation module; and 3) Redundancy Removal module. We evaluate TechSumBot in both automatic (i.e., using our benchmark) and manual (i.e., via a user study) manners. The results from both evaluations consistently demonstrate that TechSumBot outperforms the best performing baseline approaches from both SE and NLP domains by a large margin, i.e., 10.83\%–14.90\%, 32.75\%–36.59\%, and 12.61\%–17.54\%, in terms of ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, and ROUGE-L on automatic evaluation, and 5.79\%–9.23\% and 17.03\%–17.68\%, in terms of average usefulness and diversity score on human evaluation. This highlights that automatic evaluation on our benchmark can uncover findings similar to the ones found through user studies. More importantly, the automatic evaluation has a much lower cost, especially when it is used to assess a new approach. Additionally, we also conducted an ablation study, which demonstrates that each module in TechSumBot contributes to boosting the overall performance of TechSumBot. We release the benchmark as well as the replication package of our experiment at https://github.com/TechSumBot/TechSumBot.},

abstract = {Safety-critical software systems are those whose failure or malfunction could result in casualty and/or serious financial loss. In such systems, safety assurance cases (SACs) are an emerging approach that adopts a proactive strategy to produce structuralized safety justifications and arguments. While SACs are recommended in many software-intensive safety-critical domains, the lack of knowledge regarding the practitioners' perspectives on using SACs hinders effective adoption of this approach. To gain such knowledge, we interviewed nine practitioners and safety experts who focused on safety-critical software systems. In general, our participants found the SAC approach beneficial for communication of safety arguments and management of safety issues in a multidisciplinary setting. The challenges they faced when using SACs were primarily associated with (1) a lack of tool support, (2) insufficient process integration, and (3) scarcity of experienced personnel. To overcome those challenges, our participants suggested tactics that focused on creating direct safety arguments. Process and organizational adjustments are also needed to streamline SAC analysis and creation. Finally, our participants emphasized the importance of knowledge sharing about SACs across software-intensive safety-critical domains.},

Over 1,000 Stack Overflow postings were manually coded; Chi-square tests and logistic regressions were used for analysis. The study found that over half of the sample included IPA social-emotional acts. Interestingly, Disagrees , an act in IPA's negative social-emotional area, was the most frequently found category. Disagrees exhibited a significant negative relationship with the post-level outcome, post score, but a significant positive main effect and an interaction effect with a thread-level outcome, view count. The study identified two tension points: (1) potential benefits for the group of collaborative information seekers, at the slight expense of the individual who performed the negative social-emotional act; and (2) strains between the instrumental vs. social aspects of SQA.

From 1,962,535 code snippets tagged with 'python', we extracted 407,097 snippets of at least 6 statements of Python code. Surprisingly, 93.87\% of the extracted snippets contain style violations, with an average of 0.7 violations per statement and a huge number of snippets with a considerably higher ratio. Researchers and developers should, therefore, be aware that code snippets on SO may not representative of good coding style.Furthermore, while user reputation seems to be unrelated to coding style compliance, for posts with vote scores in the range between -10 and 20, we found a strong correlation (r = -0.87, p &lt; 10-7) between the vote score a post received and the average number of violations per statement for snippets in such posts.},

Three setups were compared in a hidden-profile experiment: a distributed system providing a shared display and laptops (Note&amp;Share), a regular whiteboard and pen-and-paper. The results show several advantages of the distributed system. For example, the group was more confident in the solution when using Note&amp;Share. Furthermore the number of shared arguments was significantly closer to the correct number, which suggests that misunderstandings occurred less frequently. Finally some interesting effects were observed, which we claim to be connected to the availability of pen-and-paper in all conditions. Therefore, we discuss the observed effects as well as general lessons learned from this experiment.},

abstract = {This research-in-progress examines culture's consequences on routine knowledge sharing behavior. It employs two complementary cross-cultural theories to develop an integrative model of culture and habitual system use in the context of knowledge management. More specifically, using the Theory of Basic Human Values and the Theory of IT-Culture Conflict, we posit that such cultural values as an emphasis on active mastery and change of the environment may, under certain conditions, lead to habitual knowledge management system use for knowledge sharing. In carefully selecting and integrating these two theories, this study overcomes major methodological problems inherent in much prior cross-cultural IS scholarship. We propose a quantitative methodology to test the model and discuss why structural equation modeling is the best-fitting data-analytic technique for quantitative cross-cultural IS research.},

abstract = {When scaling agile development methods, the principle of continuous improvement is challenged since most practices to support it is described on the team level and not on the project level. In this study we compare practices from two published empirical case studies on large-scale agile development implementations, with a focus on knowledge networks and process improvement. Our findings indicate that continuous process improvement will be influenced by the project type. There is a clear need for dynamic structures for learning and coordination, and these structures needs to be supported by a clear decision making process. We also describe informal arenas as an alternative to knowledge sharing in the traditional communities of practice suggested by large scale frameworks.},

abstract = {As modern software systems are becoming increasingly complex, developers often need to rely on online sources to address problems encountered during software development and maintenance. These resources provide developers with access to peers' expertise, covering knowledge of different software lifecycle phases, including design, implementation, and maintenance. However, exploiting such knowledge and converting it into actionable items is far from trivial, due to the vastness of the information available online as well as to its unstructured nature. In this research, we aim at (partially) crowdsourcing the software design, implementation and maintenance process by exploiting the knowledge embedded in various sources available on the Web (e.g., Stack Overflow discussions, presentations on SlideShare, open source code, etc.). For example, we want to support software design decisions (e.g., whether to use a specific library for the implementation of a feature) by performing opinion mining on the vast amount of information available on the Web, and we want to recommend refactoring operations by learning from the code written in open source systems. The final goal is to improve developers' productivity and code quality.},

abstract = {Nowadays, confidential data of users and companies are processed by various software applications. Therefore, it is necessary to protect them against security flaws in source code, which could, for example, allow the infringement of privacy. However, developers are usually not equipped with the required expertise to fulfill this task.To their rescue, there are tools like security code clone detectors to disclose vulnerable methods in source code. They try to find clones of written project code and vulnerable code fragments stored in a reference repository. Existing vulnerability databases, for instance the National Vulnerability Database (NVD), contain data on reported weaknesses, but the availability of example code for their occurrence, patch and exploit is scarce. Developers also use community websites to find help for secure implementations.In this paper, we propose a semi-automated process to extract security-related code from the Stack Exchange community network, where also the coding community Stack Overflow belongs. We classify the obtained code through artificial intelligence combined with natural language processing into the three security types: vulnerable, patch or exploit. In a twofold evaluation, we compared both parts with the manual activity of security experts. At first, for the search, our approach shows better precision than the experts as well as a moderate recall. Secondly, the results show that the classification of code fragments in security types is not quite easy. The investigated approaches and security experts perform with different strength regarding types of security.},

abstract = {Since their inception at the Indie Game Jam1 in 2002, a significant part of game jams has been knowledge sharing and showcasing ideas and work to peers. While various licensing mechanisms have been used for game jams throughout the years, there has never been a licence uniquely designed for artifacts created during a game jam. In this paper, we present to the community the Game Jam License (GJL) which is designed to facilitate that sharing and knowledge transfer, while making sure the original creators retain commercial rights. The Global Game Jam2, since 2009, strives to formalise sharing in a similar manner, by having jammers upload and license their creations under Creative Commons3 Non Commercial Share Alike 3.0 free license. However, the CC family of licenses is not well suited for software. CC is not compatible with most other licenses, and introduces a legal grey area with the division between commercial and non-commercial use. Moreover, open source licences like GPL are well suited for source code, but not for art and design content. Instead the GJL presented in this paper, aims to uphold the original ideas of game jams (sharing and knowledge transfer), while still allowing the original team to hold on to all rights to their creation, without any of the deficiencies of the CC family of licenses.},

The analysis aims at investigating the relationship between observed non-verbal cues and first impressions formation of warmth and competence. We first obtained both discrete and continuous annotations of our data. Discrete descriptors include non-verbal cues such as type of gestures, arms rest poses, head movements and smiles. Continuous descriptors concern annotators' judgments of the expert's warmth and competence during the observed interaction with the novice. Then we computed Odds Ratios between those descriptors. Results highlight the role of smiling in warmth and competence impressions. Smiling is associated with increased levels of warmth and decreasing competence. It also affects the impact of others non-verbal cues (e.g. self-adaptors gestures) on warmth and competence. Moreover, our findings provide interesting insights about the role of rest poses, that are associated with decreased levels of warmth and competence impressions.},

In this research the definition of SNT includes corporate social networking platforms, weblogs, wikis, and social networking sites such as Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn. To explain the role of SNTs along with other communication tools in organizations we draw on the concept of communicative ecology and sociomateriality. By integrating the two theoretical positions, we treat SNTs and people symmetrically and as members of the same sociomaterial ecology. The primary outcome of the initial stage of research is a holistic understanding of how various SNTs fit into the organizational members' sociomaterial ecology, facilitating disparate forms of knowledge sharing.},

abstract = {Stack Overflow and MedHelp are examples of domain-specific community-based question answering (CQA) systems. Different from CQA systems for general topics (e.g., Yahoo! Answers, Baidu Knows), questions and answers in domain-specific CQA systems are mostly in the same topical domain, enabling more comprehensive interaction between users on fine-grained topics. In such systems, users are more likely to ask questions on unfamiliar topics and to answer questions matching their expertise. Users can also vote answers based on their judgements. In this paper, we propose a Tri-Role Topic Model (TRTM) to model the tri-roles of users (i.e., as askers, answerers, and voters, respectively) and the activities of each role including composing question, selecting question to answer, contributing and voting answers. The proposed model can be used to enhance CQA systems from many perspectives. As a case study, we conducted experiments on ranking answers for questions on Stack Overflow, a CQA system for professional and enthusiast programmers. Experimental results show that TRTM is effective in facilitating users getting ideal rankings of answers, particularly for new and less popular questions. Evaluated on nDCG, TRTM outperforms state-of-the-art methods.},

abstract = {There is renewed interest in community networks as a mechanism for local neighbourhoods to find their voice and maintain local ownership of knowledge. In a post-Snowden, big data, age of austerity there is both widespread questioning of what happens to public generated data shared over 'free' services such as Facebook, and also a renewed focus on self-provisioning where there are gaps in digital service provision. In this paper we introduce an EU funded collaborative project ('MAZI') that is exploring how Do-It-Yourself approaches to building community networks might foster social cohesion, knowledge sharing and sustainable living through four pilots across Europe. A key challenge is to develop a shared evaluation approach that will allow us to make sense of what we are learning across highly diverse local situations and disciplinary approaches. In this paper we describe our initial approaches and the challenges we face.1},

In this paper, we conduct an exploratory study on codes in a software project's heterogeneous documents, so that we can give some hints for traceability recovery from software documents to source code. We select a famous open source software project, Lucene, as sample, and collect its four kinds of software documents, including Bug Reports, Mail Lists, Stack Overflow Q&amp;A Documents and Blogs. On this basis, we analyze these heterogeneous documents to answer the following questions: How much code is there in different kinds of documents? What APIs do these documents focus on? How many documents are relevant to the same APIs? Based on the study, we give 3 hints for recovering the traceability from software heterogeneous documents to source code.},

abstract = {The lingual barrier limits the ability of millions of non-English speaking developers to make effective use of the tremendous knowledge in Stack Overflow, which is archived in English. For cross-lingual question retrieval, one may use translation-based methods that first translate the non-English queries into English and then perform monolingual question retrieval in English. However, translation-based methods suffer from semantic deviation due to inappropriate translation, especially for domain-specific terms, and lexical gap between queries and questions that share few words in common. To overcome the above issues, we propose a novel cross-lingual question retrieval based on word embeddings and convolutional neural network (CNN) which are the state-of-the-art deep learning techniques to capture word- and sentence-level semantics. The CNN model is trained with large amounts of examples from Stack Overflow duplicate questions and their corresponding translation by machine, which guides the CNN to learn to capture informative word and sentence features to recognize and quantify semantic similarity in the presence of semantic deviations and lexical gaps. A uniqueness of our approach is that the trained CNN can map documents in two languages (e.g., Chinese queries and English questions) in a dual-language vector space, and thus reduce the cross-lingual question retrieval problem to a simple k-nearest neighbors search problem in the dual-language vector space, where no query or question translation is required. Our evaluation shows that our approach significantly outperforms the translation-based method, and can be extended to dual-language documents retrieval from different sources.},

Virtual teams have been used in health/medical area, such as home healthcare. However, the management of virtual teams is challenging. This study proposes that metaverses have the potential to provide socioemotional environments where individuals socially interact with others. Such socioemotional environments have the potential to facilitate effective collaboration and knowledge sharing in virtual teams. Building on previous research, we developed a conceptual model for understanding how metaverses enable the development of social-emotional environments in virtual teams.},

abstract = {Context: Programmers frequently look for the code of previously solved problems that they can adapt for their own problem. Despite existing example code on the web, on sites like Stack Overflow, cryptographic Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) are commonly misused. There is little known about what makes examples helpful for developers in using crypto APIs. Analogical problem solving is a psychological theory that investigates how people use known solutions to solve new problems. There is evidence that the capacity to reason and solve novel problems a.k.a Fluid Intelligence (Gf) and structurally and procedurally similar solutions support problem solving. Aim: Our goal is to understand whether similarity and Gf also have an effect in the context of using cryptographic APIs with the help of code examples. Method: We conducted a controlled experiment with 76 student participants developing with or without procedurally similar examples, one of two Java crypto libraries and measured the Gf of the participants as well as the effect on usability (effectiveness, efficiency, satisfaction) and security bugs. Results: We observed a strong effect of code examples with a high procedural similarity on all dependent variables. Fluid intelligence Gf had no effect. It also made no difference which library the participants used. Conclusions: Example code must be more highly similar to a concrete solution, not very abstract and generic to have a positive effect in a development task.},

Repairing software that uses DNNs is one such unmistakable SE need where automated tools could be beneficial; however, we do not fully understand challenges to repairing and patterns that are utilized when manually repairing DNNs. What challenges should automated repair tools address? What are the repair patterns whose automation could help developers? Which repair patterns should be assigned a higher priority for building automated bug repair tools? This work presents a comprehensive study of bug fix patterns to address these questions. We have studied 415 repairs from Stack Overflow and 555 repairs from GitHub for five popular deep learning libraries Caffe, Keras, Tensorflow, Theano, and Torch to understand challenges in repairs and bug repair patterns. Our key findings reveal that DNN bug fix patterns are distinctive compared to traditional bug fix patterns; the most common bug fix patterns are fixing data dimension and neural network connectivity; DNN bug fixes have the potential to introduce adversarial vulnerabilities; DNN bug fixes frequently introduce new bugs; and DNN bug localization, reuse of trained model, and coping with frequent releases are major challenges faced by developers when fixing bugs. We also contribute a benchmark of 667 DNN (bug, repair) instances.},

As a result, increasingly more organizations are focusing on real time knowledge sharing and collaboration. This paper explores the impact of collaborative software on an online community's control structure and subsequently on knowledge sharing in that community.Using a framework comprising theories of Legitimate Peripheral Participation and Weak-ties, we analyzed self-organizing online communities (e.g., weblog networks) and centralized online communities (e.g., discussion forums communities) with respect to the efficacy of knowledge sharing in these communities. Findings of this study indicate that self-organizing communities of practice facilitate more weak-ties among their members than centralized communities. These findings suggest that self-organizing communities would facilitate greater dissemination of knowledge among their members than centralized communities. Abundance of weak-ties in the self-organizing communities also makes these communities better environments for the discovery of new information.},

abstract = {The role of sentiment analysis is increasingly emerging to study software developers' emotions by mining crowd-generated content within software repositories and information sources. With a few notable exceptions [1][5], empirical software engineering studies have exploited off-the-shelf sentiment analysis tools. However, such tools have been trained on non-technical domains and general-purpose social media, thus resulting in misclassifications of technical jargon and problem reports [2][4]. In particular, Jongeling et al. [2] show how the choice of the sentiment analysis tool may impact the conclusion validity of empirical studies because not only these tools do not agree with human annotation of developers' communication channels, but they also disagree among themselves.Our goal is to move beyond the limitations of off-the-shelf sentiment analysis tools when applied in the software engineering domain. Accordingly, we present Senti4SD, a sentiment polarity classifier for software developers' communication channels. Senti4SD exploits a suite of lexicon-based, keyword-based, and semantic features for appropriately dealing with the domain-dependent use of a lexicon. We built a Distributional Semantic Model (DSM) to derive the semantic features exploited by Senti4SD. Specifically, we ran word2vec [3] on a collection of over 20 million documents from Stack Overflow, thus obtaining word vectors that are representative of developers' communication style. The classifier is trained and validated using a gold standard of 4,423 Stack Overflow posts, including questions, answers, and comments, which were manually annotated for sentiment polarity.We release the full lab package2, which includes both the gold standard and the emotion annotation guidelines, to ease the execution of replications as well as new studies on emotion awareness in software engineering. To inform future research on word embedding for text categorization and information retrieval in software engineering, the replication kit also includes the DSM.Results. The contribution of the lexicon-based, keyword-based, and semantic features is assessed by our empirical evaluation leveraging different feature settings. With respect to SentiStrength [6], a mainstream off-the-shelf tool that we use as a baseline, Senti4SD reduces the misclassifications of neutral and positive posts as emotionally negative. Furthermore, we provide empirical evidence of better performance also in presence of a minimal set of training documents.},

abstract = {We study the impact of different types of features for question ranking in community Question Answering: bag-of-words models (BoW), syntactic tree kernels (TKs) and rank features. It should be noted that structural kernels have never been applied to the question reranking task, i.e., question to question similarity, where they have to model paraphrase relations. Additionally, the informal text, typically present in forums, poses new challenges to the use of TKs. We compare our learning to rank (L2R) algorithms against a strong baseline given by the Google rank (GR). The results show that (i) our shallow structures used in TKs are robust enough to noisy data and (ii) improving GR requires effective BoW features and TKs along with an accurate model of GR features in the used L2R algorithm.},

abstract = {Community Question Answering (CQA) has become a primary means for people to acquire knowledge, where people are free to ask questions or submit answers. To enhance the efficiency of the service, similar question identification becomes a core task in CQA which aims to find a similar question from the archived repository whenever a new question is asked. However, it has long been a challenge to properly measure the similarity between two questions due to the inherent variation of natural language, i.e., there could be different ways to ask a same question or different questions sharing similar expressions. To alleviate this problem, it is natural to involve the existing answers for the enrichment of the archived questions. Traditional methods typically take aone-side usage, which leverages the answer as some expanded representation of the corresponding question. Unfortunately, this may introduce unexpected noises into the similarity computation since answers are often long and diverse, leading to inferior performance. In this work, we propose atwo-side usage, which leverages the answer as a bridge of the two questions. The key idea is based on our observation that similar questions could be addressed by similar parts of the answer while different questions may not. In other words, we can compare the matching patterns of the two questions over the same answer to measure their similarity. In this way, we propose a novel matching over matching model, namely Match2, which compares the matching patterns between two question-answer pairs for similar question identification. Empirical experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that our model can significantly outperform previous state-of-the-art methods on the similar question identification task.},

This paper discusses the sharing of mutually-complementary knowledge resources across organizations in the competitive strategic alliance as well as the conditions of maintaining their cooperation. The result indicates that, under the Nash balanced condition, the knowledge sharing level increases along with the expansion of the sharing cost effect. The optimum knowledge sharing coefficient is in directly proportional to the structure of the marginal cost of the whole alliances and every alliance member; it is inversely proportional to the every alliance member’s absorption coefficient on knowledge shared; it is in inversely proportional to the investment cost paid by every alliance member on acquire knowledge.},

abstract = {This study explored the interactive resources of learning in a Flipped Classroom of the university campus. While a growing number of university campuses encourage the teaching strategies of Flipped Classroom to enhance students' learning responsibility and encourage them to become more active learners, this study argues that the students with less social network resources might not benefit from the advantages of these strategies. The investigation of forming and evolution of social network behind peer learning should understand the interplay of the social forces of social selection and social influence for developing effective strategies. Among the studies of curriculum and instruction, few foci on the function of peer learning and no studies have investigated the interactions by using dynamic social network analysis. This research applies the stochastic actor-based model to model these two social forces of knowledge sharing among peermediated learning. Drawing on the literature of the knowledge construction and social influence, it aims to have a better understanding of network dynamics in a Flipped Classroom by discovering how relationships created and identifying an individual and contextual attribute that facilitate its spontaneous knowledge contribution.},

This study investigated a sample formed of (180) individuals operating in a number of hospitals within the Jordanian health sector; using the electronic collaborative system, to perform its different duties. In order to achieve this purpose the study proposed the following hypotheses: using of electronic collaborative media is positively influences on the knowledge sharing phases.

abstract = {In many Information Retrieval tasks, the boundary between classes is not well defined, and assigning a document to a specific class may be complicated, even for humans. For instance, a document which is not directly related to the user's query may still contain relevant information. In this scenario, an option is to define an intermediate class collecting ambiguous instances. Yet some natural questions arise. Is this annotation strategy convenient? how should the intermediate class be treated? To answer these questions, we explored two community question answering datasets whose comments were originally annotated with three classes. We re-annotated a subset of instances considering a binary good vs bad setting. Our main contribution is to show empirically that the inclusion of an intermediate class to assess Boolean relevance is not useful. Moreover, in case the data is already annotated with a 3-class strategy, the instances from the intermediate class can be safely removed at training time.},

This study aims to research the factors of students' knowledge sharing of health technology in universities of technology, validating a scale to measure the current situation for students' knowledge sharing of health technology and to test some models of constructing students' knowledge sharing of health technology. To achieve this goal, the following methods were adopted: literature review, Delphi survey, professional interview and sampling questionnaire survey (2,451 students from 14 technology universities in Taiwan) to examine the students' knowledge sharing of health technology. The results showed that the students' knowledge sharing of health technology consisted of behavior norm, sharing attitude, sharing intention, sharing behavior and sharing control in terms of the theory of planning behavior (TPB). The models of students' knowledge sharing of health technology were tested with good fit through structural equation modeling (SEM). Since the path correlation of model was based on TPB, the following hypotheses concerning the students' knowledge sharing behavior were supported: sharing attitude toward sharing intention, behavioral norm toward sharing intention, behavioral control toward sharing intention, sharing intention toward sharing behavior, and behavioral control toward sharing behavior, which all had positive effects. Finally, conclusions and suggestions were proposed for all forms of teaching, such as embedded teaching in health technological literacy, the methods of research and statistics, the policy of promoting students to the holistic health, and further researches including a bridge building between the universities of technology and industries for teachers and practitioners, then constructing a significant wireless connectivity of knowledge sharing with hardware and software of mobile learning in health technology should be considered.},

abstract = {Software reference architectures provide templates and guidelines for designing systems in a particular domain. Companies use them to achieve interoperability of (parts of) their software, standardization, and faster development. In contrast to system-specific software architectures that "emerge" during development, reference architectures dictate significant parts of the software design early on. Agile software development frameworks (such as Scrum) acknowledge changing software requirements and the need to adapt the software design accordingly. In this paper, we present lessons learned about how reference architectures interact with Scrum (the most frequently used agile process framework). These lessons are based on observing software development projects in five companies. We found that reference architectures can support good practice in Scrum: They provide enough design upfront without too much effort, reduce documentation activities, facilitate knowledge sharing, and contribute to "architectural thinking" of developers. However, reference architectures can impose risks or even threats to the success of Scrum (e.g., to self-organizing and motivated teams).},

abstract = {As the DoD and Military acquisitions shift the paradigm from antiquated software capabilities to artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) capabilities, they need to ensure key infrastructure (big data and knowledge artifacts) is also mature enough to handle the transition. Before any organizations or domains develop or adopt a strategy based on AI, ML, or any other form of intelligent system, they need to do a self-assessment that answers three key questions. How well does your organization/domain share knowledge? What is the state of your data? Do you understand the cognitive requirements? Answering and understanding these questions is the key to knowing where you are now (point A) so you can take actionable and progressive steps towards where you want to go (point B) to make your organization or domain AI-capable.To provide the answers and/or a path to solving the questions above we execute a Mission Engineering (ME) process that analyzes the organization’s or domain’s state of readiness. The ME process is a detailed analysis that provides an assessment of how the people, systems, knowledge, data, and processes are aligned to the operational outcomes. ME adds a layer of operational viability to existing engineering processes with the goal of ensuring the program enhances knowledge sharing, reduces cognitive burdens, and increases semantic understanding.},

This leads to many redundant, inconsistent and inaccurate tags that are detrimental to the communities. Therefore tag quality becomes a critical challenge to deal with. In this work, we propose STR, a deep learning based approach that automatically recommends tags through learning the semantics of both tags and questions in such software CQAs. First, word embedding is employed to convert text information to high-dimension vectors for better representing questions and tags. Second, a Multi-tasking-like Convolutional Neural Network, the core modules of STR, is designed to capture short and long semantics. Third, the learned semantic vectors are fed into a gradient descent based algorithm for classification. Finally, we evaluate STR on three datasets collected from popular software CQAs, and experimental results show that STR outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in terms of Precision@k, Recall@k and F1 - Measure@k.},

Next, we performed comparisons among those three MSECOs regarding: (i) developers' activity intensity, (ii) hot-topics (using Latent Dirichlet allocation algorithm) in all and more commented/viewed questions, and (iii) relationship among questions and official developer events. From the results, we identified four key insights: recruiting, educating, and monitoring strategies; barrier reduction; management of technology insertion; and fostering of relationships.},

abstract = {Fault diagnosis is a critical activity in the comprehensive support for equipment operation. Relevant research about it is becoming more and more popular. Ontology-based fault diagnosis is an important method for diagnosing faults. Due to the expressive ability, knowledge sharing and knowledge reuse based on deep semantics, and supporting for logical reasoning, ontology-based fault diagnosis has received more and more attention from researchers in the past decade. The fault diagnosis ontology describes the core concepts involved in diagnosing faults and the relationship among the concepts. Its quality and usage determine the efficiency and effectiveness of fault diagnosis, thus has a great impact on fault diagnosis. However, its knowledge source and usage have not been analyzed comprehensively to give us a deep insight into this area yet. This paper investigates and studies the ontology-based fault diagnosis during the past decade, from the perspective of knowledge source and usage of fault diagnosis ontology. In summary, it can be seen that combining ontology with other methods improves the efficiency and the effect of fault diagnosis, and ontology-based fault diagnosis needs to be integrated into the whole process of fault diagnosis. To make knowledge of fault diagnosis complete, machine learning shall be used for the ontological engineering.},

abstract = {Based on the supposition that enterprise employees are rationality-bounded, this paper establishes an evolutionary game model of knowledge sharing inside enterprise. We can get the evolutionary stable point of the model by calculation. By the analysis of the position of the stable point, we can find out the key factors which should be focused upon during the design of knowledge sharing incentive mechanism inside the enterprise. We submit a major argument that an appropriate incentive mechanism with the proper focusing factors could make the knowledge sharing of an enterprise evolve toward a state which is satisfied by enterprise managers.},

There are many issues within telehealth that relate in some way to the management of knowledge and we identify from a range of papers these specific issues. We propose a virtual expertise platform that provides the basic building blocks for effect leveraging of expertise in this domain. The platform includes management directives and goals, a collaborative culture, an appropriate ICT platform and a knowledge tools layer that interact facilitate knowledge sharing and ultimately improved patient care. We also emphasise how social media tools can be used as part of the knowledge tools layer to improve virtual knowledge sharing before and after the telehealth events.},

abstract = {Online knowledge sharing sites have recently exploded in popularity, and have began to play an important role in online information seeking. Unfortunately, many factors that influence the effectiveness of the information exchange in these communities are not well understood. This paper is an attempt to fill this gap by exploring the dynamics of information sharing in such sites - that is, identifying the factors that can explain how people respond to information requests. As a case study, we use Yahoo! Answers, one of the leading knowledge sharing portals on the web with millions of active participants. We follow the progress of thousands of questions, from posting until resolution. We examine contextual factors such as the topical area of the questions, as well as intrinsic factors of question wording, subjectivity, sentiment, and other characteristics that could influence how a community responds to an information request. Our findings could be useful for improving existing collaborative question answering systems, and for designing the next generation of knowledge sharing communities.},

It is important to understand what influence employees contribute to knowledge sharing. Using survey responses from 173 employees of a large US university, we found that employees' creative contributions to an electronic knowledge sharing database (EKSDB) are directly influenced by their levels of affective commitment, perceptions of creative contributions as an in-role behavior, and perceptions of technological adequacy. Top management openness affects employee contribution indirectly through employee affective commitment and perception of creative contributions as an in-role behavior. In addition, the effects of employee affective commitment and perceptions of creative contribution as an in-role behavior on employee contribution are moderated by employee job security. By including intrinsic, extrinsic, and contextual variables, this model improves upon previous representations of factors leading employees' to make creative contributions to an EKSDB.},

The current paper describes research-in-progress to examine the skills, cultural shifts, and mindset changes necessary to capitalize on cyberinfrastructure for sharing scientific knowledge. Open-ended interview questions will be used to uncover the factors that are uniquely important in scientific knowledge sharing. While the research is focused on plant scientists who are involved with the iPlant collaborative, an NSF-funded project to build cyberinfrastructure to support research in the plant sciences, the results should be broadly applicable to large-scale technology-enabled science.},

abstract = {Context: Previous work have investigated the industry's state of practice on technical debt (TD) by surveying invited practitioners. However, these studies have included only practitioners with a sound understanding of TD, which might incur biases in their findings. One way to reduce this bias is to consider Q&amp;A platforms, such as Stack Overflow (SO), because of containing practitioners with different roles and levels of TD knowledge. Therefore, the discussions on SO can broaden the perception of the state of practice on TD in the industry. Goal: To investigate how TD concepts have been discussed by SO's practitioners. Method: First, we employed data mining techniques to identify TD-related discussions on SO. Next, based on significance and popularity metrics, we considered 195 discussions to be further investigated. For each discussion, we analyzed its contents to identify types of TD followed by activities, strategies, and tools used in its management. Results: We found that code, infrastructure, and architecture debt are the most discussed types of TD on SO. Similarly, TD identification and payment are the most discussed activities. Regarding tools and strategies for TD management, SonarQube and refactoring have been mostly mentioned by practitioners. Conclusion: Our findings may indicate new research directions, as well as expanding the empirical knowledge on how the industry has handled TD.},

abstract = {In many social networks, people interact based on their interests. Community detection algorithms are then useful to reveal the sub-structures of a network and help us find interest groups. Identifying these social communities can bring benefit to understanding and predicting users behaviors. However, for some kind of online community sites such as question-and-answer (Q&amp;A) sites or forums, there is no friendship based social network structure, which means people are not aware who they are in contact with. Therefore, many traditional community detection techniques do not apply directly. In this paper, we propose an empirical approach for extracting data from Q&amp;A sites suitable to apply community detection methods. Then we compare three kinds of community detection methods we applied on a dataset extracted from the popular Q&amp;A site StackOverflow. We analyze and comment the results of each method.},

abstract = {Nowadays, community question answering (CQA) systems have attracted millions of users to share their valuable knowledge. Matching relevant answers for a specific question is a core function of CQA systems. Previous interaction-based matching approaches show promising performance in CQA systems. However, they typically suffer from two limitations: (1) They usually model content as word sequences, which ignores the semantics provided by non-consecutive phrases, long-distance word dependency and visual information. (2) Word-level interactions focus on the distribution of similar words in terms of position, while being agnostic to the semantic-level interactions between questions and answers. To address these limitations, we propose aHierarchical Graph Semantic Pooling Network (HGSPN) to model the hierarchical semantic-level interactions in a unified framework for multi-modal CQA matching. Instead of viewing text content as word sequences, we convert them into graphs, which can model non-consecutive phrases and long-distance word dependency for better obtaining the composition of semantics. In addition, visual content is also modeled into the graphs to provide complementary semantics. A well-designed stacked graph pooling network is proposed to capture the hierarchical semantic-level interactions between questions and answers based on these graphs. A novel convolutional matching network is designed to infer the matching score by integrating the hierarchical semantic-level interaction features. Experimental results on two real-world datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art CQA matching models.},

abstract = {NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topology (NEAT) is one of the most successful algorithms for solving traditional reinforcement learning (RL) tasks such as pole-balancing. However, the algorithm faces serious challenges while tackling problems with large state spaces, particularly the Atari game playing tasks. This is due to the major flaw that NEAT aims at evolving a single neural network (NN) that must be able to simultaneously extract high-level state features and select action outputs. However such complicated NNs cannot be easily evolved directly through NEAT. To address this issue, we propose a new reinforcement learning scheme based on NEAT with two key technical advancements: (1) a new three-stage learning scheme is introduced to clearly separate feature learning and policy learning to allow effective knowledge sharing and learning across multiple agents; (2) various policy gradient search algorithms can be seamlessly integrated with NEAT for training policy networks with deep structures to achieve effective and sample efficient RL. Experiments on several Atari games confirm that our new learning scheme can be more effective and has higher sample efficiency than NEAT and three state-of-the-art algorithms from the most recent RL literature.},

According to the research presented by different scholars, there are more than 10 databases for African traditional plants medicine. The translation of biodiversity towards the new therapy has been a challenge towards creating the database for traditional medicine in Africa. This has led to most of the available database lack enough information on ethnopharmacological data. The effort towards the introduction of bioinformatics in most of the undergraduate circular gives the best direction towards developments of computational in pharmaceutical fields. By concluding, the development of global data in a single indigenous knowledge system may be impossible in view of the culture and biodiversity differences; efforts have to be given to specific regional areas and African museum should act as a center to link all indigenous knowledge systems. The need of using the collaborative approach for defining a common standard in medicinal plant database for knowledge sharing and scientific advancement is inevitable in developing a unified indigenous knowledge systems Database for African Traditional Medicine.},

abstract = {Expert finding is a task designed to enable recommendation of the right person who can provide high-quality answers to a requester's question. Most previous works try to involve a content-based recommendation, which only superficially comprehends the relevance between a requester's question and the expertise of candidate experts by exploring the content or topic similarity between the requester's question and the candidate experts' historical answers. However, if a candidate expert has never answered a question similar to the requester's question, then existing methods have difficulty making a correct recommendation. Therefore, exploring the implicit relevance between a requester's question and a candidate expert's historical records by perception and reasoning should be taken into consideration. In this study, we propose a novel textslrecurrent memory reasoning network (RMRN) to perform this task. This method focuses on different parts of a question, and accordingly retrieves information from the histories of the candidate expert.Since only a small percentage of historical records are relevant to any requester's question, we introduce a Gumbel-Softmax-based mechanism to select relevant historical records from candidate experts' answering histories. To evaluate the proposed method, we constructed two large-scale datasets drawn from Stack Overflow and Yahoo! Answer. Experimental results on the constructed datasets demonstrate that the proposed method could achieve better performance than existing state-of-the-art methods.},

abstract = {Automatically recommending API-related tutorial fragments or Q&amp;A pairs from Stack Overflow (SO) is very helpful for developers, especially when they need to use unfamiliar APIs to complete programming tasks. However, in practice developers are more likely to express the API-related questions using natural language when they do not know the exact name of an unfamiliar API. In this paper, we propose an approach, called SOTU, to automatically find answers for API-related natural language questions (NLQs) from tutorials and SO. We first identify relevant API-related tutorial fragments and extract API-related Q&amp;A pairs from SO. We then construct an API-Answer corpus by combining these two sources of information. For an API-related NLQ given by the developer, we parse it into several potential APIs and then retrieve potential answers from the API-Answer corpus. Finally, we return a list of potential results ranked by their relevancy. Experiments on API-Answer corpus demonstrate the effectiveness of SOTU.},

abstract = {Quantified self-experimentation with personal diets is a popular activity among health enthusiasts, diagnosed patients, as well as "life hackers" pursuing self-optimization goals. In this paper, we reflect on self-experimentation practices in the context of amateur citizen science communities. We report findings from 11 month-long qualitative fieldwork in a community of nutrition hobbyists experimenting with a powdered food substitute "soylent". Our respondents customized the soylent powders to their personal needs, tracked their metabolic reactions to the diet, and discussed their findings with the online soylent user community. Although the data and knowledge sharing within the community positively impacted respondents' nutrition literacy, these activities created risks regarding their health safety and data privacy. We define soylent self-experimentation as a form of "extreme citizen science". Based on the limitations identified in the soylent community, we suggest a set of design recommendations for extreme citizen science projects.},

Although these sites provide opportunities for users to seek for help or provide answers, they also bring new challenges. One of the challenges is most new questions posted everyday cannot be routed to the appropriate users who can answer them in CQA. That is to say, experts cannot receive questions that match their expertise. Therefore new questions cannot be answered in time. In this paper, we propose an approach which based on distributed representations of words to predict the best answerer for a new question on CQA sites. Our approach considers both user activity and user authority. The user activity and user authority are based on the previous questions answered by the user. We have applied our model on the dataset downloaded from StackOverflow, one of the biggest CQA sites. The results show that our approach performs better than the TF-IDF and Language Model based methods.},

abstract = {This study investigates the antecedents of individual learning under knowledge team environments, where team members work together for a limited time period, share knowledge informally and eventually create a knowledge outcome that is beneficial for an organization. Participating in a knowledge team provides individual members with a good opportunity to learn during a short period of time, since they work on novel and creative tasks. However, because knowledge team activities are often non-routine for each member, their attitudes toward and psychological involvement with their knowledge team activities vary among different individuals. In this study, we suggest that individual passion about knowledge team activities is an important psychological input for individual members' external knowledge sourcing, internal knowledge sharing, and helping behaviors, which eventually lead to improving an individual's learning outcomes through knowledge team activities. We hypothesize that individual passion about the activities in a knowledge team positively influences both 1) knowledge management (sourcing and sharing) behavior; and 2) the organizational citizenship behavior -- helping (OCB-helping) of individuals, and these behaviors, in turn, result in their learning outcomes. Also, members' perceived psychological safety within knowledge teams positively moderates the impact of members' passion on internal knowledge sharing and helping behavior on learning outcomes. The research model will be tested with survey data from the knowledge team participants. We conclude with potential contributions of this study for the academy and practice.},

abstract = {Answer selection plays a key role in community question answering (CQA). Previous research on answer selection usually ignores the problems of redundancy and noise prevalent in CQA. In this paper, we propose to treat different text segments differently and design a novel attentive interactive neural network (AI-NN) to focus on those text segments useful to answer selection. The representations of question and answer are first learned by convolutional neural networks (CNNs) or other neural network architectures. Then AI-NN learns interactions of each paired segments of two texts. Row-wise and column-wise pooling are used afterwards to collect the interactions. We adopt attention mechanism to measure the importance of each segment and combine the interactions to obtain fixed-length representations for question and answer. Experimental results on CQA dataset in SemEval-2016 demonstrate that AI-NN outperforms state-of-the-art method.},

abstract = {Intelligent services are becoming increasingly more pervasive; application developers want to leverage the latest advances in areas such as computer vision to provide new services and products to users, and large technology firms enable this via RESTful APIs. While such APIs promise an easy-to-integrate on-demand machine intelligence, their current design, documentation and developer interface hides much of the underlying machine learning techniques that power them. Such APIs look and feel like conventional APIs but abstract away data-driven probabilistic behaviour---the implications of a developer treating these APIs in the same way as other, traditional cloud services, such as cloud storage, is of concern. The objective of this study is to determine the various pain-points developers face when implementing systems that rely on the most mature of these intelligent services, specifically those that provide computer vision. We use Stack Overflow to mine indications of the frustrations that developers appear to face when using computer vision services, classifying their questions against two recent classification taxonomies (documentation-related and general questions). We find that, unlike mature fields like mobile development, there is a contrast in the types of questions asked by developers. These indicate a shallow understanding of the underlying technology that empower such systems. We discuss several implications of these findings via the lens of learning taxonomies to suggest how the software engineering community can improve these services and comment on the nature by which developers use them.},

abstract = {This paper discusses challenges of an online evaluation technique, multileaved comparison, based on the analysis of evaluation results in a community question-answering (cQA) search service. NTCIR-13 OpenLiveQ task offered a shared task in which participants addressed an ad-hoc retrieval task in a cQA service, and evaluated their rankers by multileaved comparison, which combines multiple rankings to generate a single search result page, and simultaneously evaluates the different rankings based on users' clicks on the search result page. Since the number of search result impressions during the evaluation period might not suffice to evaluate a hundred of rankers, we conducted the online evaluation only for rankers that achieved high performance in offline evaluation. The analysis of evaluation results showed that offline and online evaluation results did not fully agree, and a large number of users' clicks were necessary to find a statistically significant difference for every ranker pair. To cope with these problems in large-scale multileaved comparison, we propose a new experimental design that evaluates all the rankers online but intensively tests only the top-k rankers. Simulation-based experiments demonstrated that Copeland counting algorithm could achieve high top-k recall in the top-k identification problem for multileaved comparison.},

We propose a multilevel model that suggests that the interaction of organizational identity and cross-boundary knowledge sharing may result in information systems with final functionality different from planned functionality. The model also suggests that organizational-level decisional events, such as the choice of integration approach between the merging entities, may influence how new information systems are developed at a group level, and how those organizational-level events, in turn, are shaped by group-level events.},

abstract = {Knowledge management plays an important role in the software architecting process. Recently, this role has become more apparent by a paradigm shift that views a software architecture as the set of architectural design decisions it embodies. This shift has sparked the discussion in both research and practice on how to best facilitate sharing of so-called architectural knowledge, and how tools can best be employed. In order to design successful tool support for architectural knowledge sharing it is important to take into account what software architecting really entails. To this end, in this paper we define the main characteristics of architecting, based on observations in a large software development organization, and state-of-the-art literature in software architecture. Based on the defined characteristics, we determine how best practices known from knowledge management could be used to improve architectural knowledge sharing. This results in the definition of a set of desired properties of architectural knowledge sharing tools. To improve the status quo of architectural knowledge sharing tools, we present the design of an architectural knowledge sharing platform.},

Despite its numerous benefits and usefulness highlighted in literature, majority are hesitant and reluctant to use online learning platforms available in Bangladesh. Alternatively, scholars from diverse disciplines have identified the construct 'social influence' as a prevailing predictor of the variable 'behavioral intention' to adopt numerous online platforms: blogs, e-services, online game and the predictor, social influence, plays a substantial role in embracing online learning as well as communicating the usefulness of various e-learning platforms. The study, therefore, is spearheaded to ascertain the role of social influence in facilitating learners' behavioral intention to accept online learning and communicating the usefulness of the e-learning in Bangladesh. To manifest the effect that one variable has on another, the study analyzed data of one hundred respondents surveyed randomly and confirmed the existence of the significant relationships: social influence (SI) and behavioral intention (BI), social influence (SI) and perceived usefulness (PU) in facilitating online learning acceptance, which provides an outline to the educators to comprehend behavior of the learners. The result of the study may also assist the educators and administrators to devise useful initiatives to intensify penetration rate of using online learning within the institution in Bangladesh. The research further adds to the existing literature that explains adoption and acceptance behavior of online education.},

However, creating these models requires parallel data between natural language (NL) and code with fine-grained alignments. Stack Overflow (SO) is a promising source to create such a data set but existing heuristic methods are limited both in their coverage and the correctness of the NL-code pairs obtained. In this paper, we propose a method to mine high-quality aligned data from SO by training a classifier using two sets of features: hand-crafted features considering the structure of the extracted snippets, and correspondence features obtained by training a neural network model to capture the correlation between NL and code. Experiments using Python and Java as test beds show that the proposed method greatly expands coverage and accuracy over existing mining methods, even when using only a small number of labeled examples.},

Textual content classification has been used to retrieve only relevant information to solve specific problems. However, those classifiers tend to present poor performance when the target classes have similar content. We aim at developing a Named Entity Recognizer (NER) model to recognize entities related to technical elements, and to improve textual classifiers for Android fragmentation posts from Stack Overflow using the obtained NER model. The proposed NER model was trained for the entities API version, device, hardware, API element, technology and feature. The proposed classifiers were trained using the recognized entities as attributes. To evaluate the performances of these classifiers, we compared them with other three textual classifiers. The obtained results show that the constructed NER model can recognize entities efficiently, as well as discover new entities that were not present in the training data. The classifiers constructed using the NER model produced better results than the other baseline classifiers. We suggest that NER-based classifiers should be considered as a better alternative to classify technical textual context compared to generic textual classifiers.},

abstract = {Context: An essential part of conducting software engineering (SE) research is the ability to identify extant research on tools, technologies, concepts and methods in order to evaluate and make rational and scientific decisions. The domain from which such knowledge is extracted is typically existing research literature found in journals, conference proceedings, books and gray literature. Empirical approaches that include various systematic review (SR) methodologies such as systematic literature review (SLR) and systematic mapping study (SMS) are found to be effective in this context. They adopt rigorous planning, follow repeatable and well-defined processes, and produce unbiased and evidence-based outcomes. Despite these significant benefits, the general trend on using these systematic review (SR) methodologies is not encouraging in SE research. The primary reasons emerging are twofold - a) SR methodologies are largely cited as time-consuming activities and b) lack of guidance to conduct systematic reviews. This tutorial discusses these concerns and describes an effective way of using SR methodologies for SE research.Objectives: Attendees will be introduced to the key concepts, methods and processes for conducting systematic literature reviews (SLR) and systematic mapping studies (SMS). The benefits, limitations, guidelines for using SR methodologies in an effective manner will discussed in the session. Attendees will be guided on the appropriate formulation of a research question and sub questions; the development of a review protocol such as inclusion criteria, exclusion criteria, quality criteria and classification structures; and execution of review protocol using digital libraries and syntheses of review data. A web based software tool1, for supporting the systematic literature review process will be demonstrated and attendees will get the opportunity to use the tool to conduct the review to help in identification of relevant research and extraction and synthesis of data.Method: We will use a blend of information presentation, interactive hands-on session and knowledge sharing session. The presentation will introduce the key concepts, benefits, limitations and how to overcome the limitations; hands on session will illustrate a review process with a case study, and finally the knowledge sharing session will discuss the experiences, best practices and the lesson learnt.},

Tagging is a popular system across web communities because allowing users to classify their contents is less costly than employing an expert to categorize them. However, tagging systems suffer from the problem of the tag explosion and the tag synonym. To solve these problems, we propose a tag recommendation method using topic modeling approaches. Topic models have advantages of dimensionality reduction and document similarity. We also emphasize highest topics in calculating document similarity to retrieve more relevant documents. Our tag recommendation method considers the document similarity and the historical tag occurrence to calculate tag scores. Experiment results show that emphasizing highest topic distributions increases overall performance of tag recommendation.},

abstract = {Person-to-person knowledge sharing is considered a key aspect of any effective collaboration. Many studies have investigated what motivates team members to share knowledge, but few have explored the role trust plays in knowledge seeking and acceptance. We conducted an empirical field study to investigate trust in distributed teams and its influence on knowledge seeking and acceptance practices in a Fortune 500 organization. Our main objective in this study was to investigate what factors determine who will be sought when knowledge is needed, and what the criteria are for knowledge acceptance in person-to-person knowledge sharing. Study findings provide a substantial understanding of knowledge-seeking practices, knowledge-acceptance needs, and the role trust plays in these practices and needs. In this paper, we discuss these findings and their implications on future tool support.},

As to the knowledge sharing, which is the important procedure of organizational knowledge management, previous researches regarded it as attribute data, but this paper has pointed out that it should be gathered as relationship data. Knowledge sharing is the interaction between subjects, the study on it should be directed to the relationship they are building. Computer-based survey is a better way to gather relationship data than traditional paper-and-pencil survey. Although it has limitations, it has the advantages over other methods such as easy anchoring, high adaptivity, Good Security, convenient networking. Then this paper takes an 8-person team as an example. The design of computer-base survey system ensures that each member of the team can evaluate his/her knowledge sharing behavior with every specific person. Also, the computer-based survey can form the social network through the backstage data gathered.},

abstract = {Electronic community (e-community) has been a vital platform among members of a special interest group (SIG). Compared to other interest groups, technical SIG groups require more beneficial communications and materials to be shared among the members. However, they may encounter a lot of challenges to draw the interest among the members in sharing their knowledge voluntarily. A lot of knowledge sharing researches focuses on how to develop a knowledge sharing system. Hence, they overlook the need to integrate social aspects in the design of such systems. As the result, the systems face inactive participants among the members. In fact, the most crucial part of developing such online communities is on how to encourage users to contribute and share their knowledge. We must discover the underlying problems on why the users are reluctant to share their knowledge through the knowledge sharing system. This paper discusses the survey conducted in order to gain users’ perspectives towards such systems for SIG.},

Very recent research has demonstrated the significance of this limitation, identifying critical relationships between Google and Wikipedia that are highly relevant to many areas of Wikipedia-based research and practice. This paper extends this recent research beyond search engines to examine Wikipedia's relationships with large-scale online communities, Stack Overflow and Reddit in particular. We find evidence of consequential, albeit unidirectional relationships. Wikipedia provides substantial value to both communities, with Wikipedia content increasing visitation, engagement, and revenue, but we find little evidence that these websites contribute to Wikipedia in return. Overall, these findings highlight important connections between Wikipedia and its broader ecosystem that should be considered by researchers studying Wikipedia. Critically, our results also emphasize the key role that volunteer-created Wikipedia content plays in improving other websites, even contributing to revenue generation.},

abstract = {Industry 4.0 R&amp;D is currently driving the emergence of Smart Production Environments (SPE) where the manufacturing of new products takes place very flexibly and dynamically in several steps and locations, possibly distributed all over the world. Companies involved in such smart productions act in highly competitive global markets and always have to find new ways to, e.g., cut costs by changing to the best providers, or enabling, e.g., tax savings, to stay competitive. This can only be achieved by using the fastest, most effective, efficient, and flexible distributed collaborative production processes. In this context, a Collaborative Adaptive Production Process Planning (CAPPP) can be supported by semantic product data management approaches enabling production-knowledge representation, utilization, curation, and archival as well as knowledge sharing, access, and reuse in many flexible and efficient ways. To support such scenarios, semantic representation of production knowledge integrated into a machine-readable process formalization is a key enabling factor for sharing such explicit knowledge resources in cloud-based production knowledge repositories. Our approach of Knowledge-Based Production Planning (KPP) introduces such a method and already provides a corresponding prototypical Proof-of-Concept implementation. In this way, it can not only be used in production planning but also, e.g., in Collaborative Manufacturing Change Management (CMCM) as well as, e.g., in Collaborative Assembly-, Logistics- and Layout Planning (CALLP) both building on the results of CAPPP. Therefore, a collaborative planning and optimization from mass to lot-size one production in a machine readable and processable representation will be possible. On the other hand, KPP knowledge can be shared to support other types of innovation, collaboration, and cocreation within a cloud-based semantic production knowledge repository.},

abstract = {In the context of Safety Critical Systems (SCSs), safety measures derived from the dysfunctional analysis are generally expressed in an informal way. However, in an early phase of SCSs design, there is a need to link these safety measures to Goal-Oriented Requirements Engineering (GORE) concepts. Moreover, the current practice of the safety measures development is not based on a specific goal-oriented control model. Since there are different knowledge domains, there is a lack of a common vocabulary aiming to avoid the semantic heterogeneity between them. Consequently, a common model for an unambiguous knowledge sharing and a full semantic interoperability assurance is missing. In this paper, we propose the Goal-Oriented Safety Management Ontology (GOSMO), a domain ontology, which is grounded in the Unified Foundational Ontology (UFO) and provides a conceptualization and a real-world semantic interpretation of the knowledge matching for SCSs. Furthermore, the proposed safety measures development process is performed using a reinterpretation from the safety point of view of the Organization-Based Control Access (Or-BAC), which was initially developed for the Information Systems (IS) security. The GOSMO aims to capture the alignment between the considered domains concepts through the reference models reuse and the proposed taxonomy based on standards definitions. The proposed ontology is evaluated by the formalization of two cases studies from the railway domain, since it is the target application domain. Finally, the evaluation results show that GOSMO covers and analyses several real critical situations and fulfils its intended purpose.},

Negative binomial regressions and negative binomial mixed models are built to investigate the relationships among thread structure, level of user activity, user profiles and the ratings of threads and comments in the community. Results indicate that in the better rated threads, the structures tend to be more centralized with heterogeneous participants discussing the problem at a deeper level. Meanwhile, contributions with good ratings are more likely to be produced by users who are more engaged in commenting behaviors.},

abstract = {Challenges over multi-site software development are on working in virtual teams and sharing knowledge. It is quite normal that software engineers working in a virtual team have never met face to face in multi-site environments. In addition they have different educational backgrounds and interpret methods in different ways. Software engineering education, training, and practice are different between universities, cities, and countries. As a result, it is difficult to share a piece of knowledge between distributed teams and among remote team members. There are a number of standards that different teams could be referring to. Remote software engineers use a particular standard as their own individual guide and when they share their own knowledge base and terminology is different from those of others. Most issues raised are related to inconsistency in understanding software engineering theories and practice. Therefore sharing knowledge is the challenge and to resolve the differences between the distributed teams we need to understand its key variables of knowledge sharing. In this paper we propose an ontology-based approach for knowledge sharing measurement. Particularly in the approach, we look into measurement of transferability and complexity of knowledge. The impact of nature of knowledge on knowledge sharing is focused. A prototype is developed taking Software Engineering Ontology as example.},

However, limited research attention has been given to the individual's salient beliefs about knowledge sharing. This paper aims to study the role of individual's attitude towards knowledge sharing, from a socio-psychological perspective, and how it drives the decision to share knowledge. The paper proposes that an individual's knowledge sharing behavior is driven by a set of salient beliefs that are not unlike the notion of payoff in game theory. Using the case of a telecommunication company in Egypt (will be referred to as company X in this paper), the paper employed multi-person game theoretic structure to determine the game played by the employees. The researcher found that the perceived payoff of knowledge sharing can be characterized by a multi-person game and that drivers of individual's behavior are self esteem, expected association, expected contribution, self consistency, level of understanding, time to share, and self interest.},

These Q&amp;A contents cover a wide range of topics, and they are useful for users to resolve queries and obtain new knowledge. Meanwhile, when people are reading digital documents, they may encounter reading problems such as lack of background information and unclear illustration of concepts. We believe that Q&amp;A sites offer high-quality contents which can serve as rich supplements to digital documents. In this paper, we devise a rigorous formulation of the novel text enrichment problem, and design an end-to-end system named QALink which assigns the most relevant Q&amp;A contents to the corresponding section of the document. We first present a new segmentation approach to model each document with a hierarchical structure. Based on the hierarchy, queries are constructed to retrieve and rank related question-answer pairs. Both syntactical and semantic features are adopted in our system. The empirical evaluation results indicate that QALink is able to effectively enrich text documents with relevant Q&amp;A contents to help people better understand the documents.},

abstract = {The wide spectrum use of mobile devices has brought numerous opportunities to develop and design Mobile Learning (M-learning) applications that will assist learners in their studies. From the M-learning perspective, in order to improve the learners' capabilities through the use of mobile devices, Knowledge Management (KM) processes (Knowledge Acquisition, Knowledge Sharing, Knowledge Application, and Knowledge Protection) should be incorporated in M-learning applications. The literature shows that several research studies were carried out with the aim of developing M-learning applications. Due to the lack of literature on examining the impact of KM processes on M-learning acceptance theoretically and practically, the main objective of this study is to develop a M-learning application that enables KM processes (Acquisition, Sharing, Application, and Protection). Moreover, the paper describes the M-learning application framework that was developed based on KM processes. In addition, the paper deliberates the implementation of the application in two different universities in two different regions, namely: Universiti Malaysia Pahang (UMP) in Malaysia, and Al Buraimi University College (BUC) in Oman. Other implications and discussions are also presented in the paper.},

In this paper, three novel deep neural network architectures are explored to improve the far-field speech recognition accuracy by exploiting the parallel far-field and close-talk recordings. All three novel architectures use multi-task learning for the model optimization but focus on three different ideas: dereverberation and recognition joint-learning, close-talk and far-field model knowledge sharing, and environment-code aware training. Experiments on the AMI single distant microphone (SDM) task show that each of the proposed method can boost accuracy individually, and additional improvement can be obtained with appropriate integration of these models. Overall we reduced the error rate by 10\% relatively on the SDM set by exploiting the IHM data.},

abstract = {Community Question Answering (CQA) site is an online platform for hosting information in question-answer form by collaborative users worldwide. There are basically two types of user in this CQA sites: Asker -- who post their query as questions and Answerer -- who provide the answers to these questions. The semi-structured and growing size of contents in CQA sites is posing several challenges. As there is no restriction in posting the number of answers to a question, so the common challenge is to identify the authoritative answerers of a question in order to evaluate the answer quality for selecting the best answer. In this paper, we use latent dirichlet allocation (LDA) the statistical topic modelling on textual data and statistical computing on metadata to identify the features that would reflect the topical authoritative of answerer. Then these features are represented as vector for each answerer of the dataset under investigation for learning the classifier model. The various baseline classifier model are used to identify the topical authoritative answerer on Q&amp;A posts of two real dataset extracted from StackOverflow and AskUbuntu. The correctness and effectiveness of classifier models are evaluated using various parameters like accuracy, precision, recall, and kappa statistic. The experimental result shows that Random Forest classifier outperforms over each evaluation parameter than other classification algorithms.},

Sharing the knowledge incurs a cost for the sharing agent, and thus non-sharing is the preferred option for selfish agents. Through agent-based simulations we show that knowledge sharing is possible even in the presence of non-sharing agents in the population. We also show that the performance of an agent society can be better when some agents bear the cost of sharing instead of the whole group.},

abstract = {The article presents a methodology for using service robots in the process of rehabilitation for children in special education. The aim of the study is to provide effective experimental use of an innovative model for overcoming the social exclusion of disabled people (with special focus on young people), ensuring a dignified and independent life by piloting an intelligent modular service mobile robots called "AnRI" (Anthropomorphic Robot Intelligent). The EC-Funded Marie Curie Project H2020-MSCA-RISE-2017, No77720, Cyber-Physical Systems for Pedagogical Rehabilitation in Special Education, (CybSPEED), is contributing to the introduction of a model for the use of robotic technologies and "AnRI" robots in special education by disabled children and young people. The opportunity to explore experience and sustainable cooperation between beneficiaries and partners was used in the frame of the Project. It is shown, using from Service Robots "AnRI", the innovative approach, developed by KyuTech University - Japan, a partner in the CybSPEED project, for transmitting information with the help of "Key Words". The generation of knowledge and expertise in the field of pedagogical rehabilitation of people with disabilities is described, which will help to identify the needs of the target group of students with the use of service robots. It is shown also the processes of the study, testing of robotic assistive devices for people with disabilities and knowledge sharing, which provides project partners with completely new tools and forms of assistance for people with disabilities and will contribute to the improvement of existing practices. In the methodology described, not only an innovative element, the use of "AnRI" robots, but also new solutions for social problems, which will implemented in good cooperation with the professional team of the Social Services Center "St. Nedelya", Sandanski, Bulgaria.},

abstract = {Delay-tolerant network (DTN) has been employed as a viable option for exchanging situational information during post-disaster communication. In contrast to stable network, network reliability in DTN depends on the contact opportunities among the nodes (both mobile and static). Higher degree of contact opportunity implies improved message delivery with reduced delivery latency, which results in enhanced network reliability. In order to improve the degree of contact opportunity among the nodes the deployment of static relay nodes (Throwboxes) has been widely adopted. In order to deploy Throwboxes effectively, prior knowledge regarding network parameters like scale of the network, network topology and mobility pattern of nodes etc. is essential. However, availability of such parameters in post disaster scenarios becomes challenging. Therefore, in this work, we propose an encounter based Throwbox deployment strategy EnTER. The proposed strategy attempts to formulate an empirical relationship between the degree of contact opportunity and extent of network reliability in DTN. The extent of network reliability is measured in terms of Knowledge Sharing Ratio and Average Delivery Latency. This relationship helps in formulating a suitable strategy for deploying Throwboxes in a post-disaster scenario. Extensive simulation by implementing a realistic post-disaster scenario reveals that our proposed Throwbox deployment strategy outperforms one of the state-of-the-art Throwbox deployment strategies in terms of network reliability.},

abstract = {We transfer a key idea from the field of sentiment analysis to a new domain: community question answering (cQA). The cQA task we are interested in is the following: given a question and a thread of comments, we want to re-rank the comments, so that the ones that are good answers to the question would be ranked higher than the bad ones. We notice that good vs. bad comments use specific vocabulary and that one can often predict the goodness/badness of a comment even ignoring the question, based on the comment contents only. This leads us to the idea to build a good/bad polarity lexicon as an analogy to the positive/negative sentiment polarity lexicons, commonly used in sentiment analysis. In particular, we use pointwise mutual information in order to build large-scale goodness polarity lexicons in a semi-supervised manner starting with a small number of initial seeds. The evaluation results show an improvement of 0.7 MAP points absolute over a very strong baseline, and state-of-the art performance on SemEval-2016 Task 3.},

Programmers increasingly rely on crowdsourced knowledge and code, as they look to Question \&amp; Answer (Q&amp;A) sites for answers or use code from publicly posted snippets. Programmers play, compete, and learn with the crowd, engaging in programming competitions and puzzles with crowds of programmers. Online IDEs make possible radically new forms of collaboration, allowing developers to synchronously program with crowds of distributed programmers. Programmers' reputation is increasingly visible on Q&amp;A sites and public code repositories, opening new possibilities in how developers find jobs and companies identify talent. Crowds of non-programmers increasingly participate in development, usability testing software or even constructing specifications while playing games. Crowds play an increasing role in shaping software requirements, broadening the software which might be feasibly constructed. Approaches for crowd development seek to microtask software development, dramatically increasing participation in open source by enabling software projects to be built through casual, transient work.},

abstract = {Most explainable AI (XAI) research projects focus on well-delineated topics, such as interpretability of machine learning outcomes, knowledge sharing in a multi-agent system or human trust in agent’s performance. For the development of explanations in human-agent teams, a more integrative approach is needed. This paper proposes a perceptual-cognitive explanation (PeCoX) framework for the development of explanations that address both the perceptual and cognitive foundations of an agent’s behavior, distinguishing between explanation generation, communication and reception. It is a generic framework (i.e., the core is domain-agnostic and the perceptual layer is model-agnostic), and being developed and tested in the domains of transport, health-care and defense. The perceptual level entails the provision of an Intuitive Confidence Measure and the identification of the “foil” in a contrastive explanation. The cognitive level entails the selection of the beliefs, goals and emotions for explanations. Ontology Design Patterns are being constructed for the reasoning and communication, whereas Interaction Design Patterns are being constructed for the shaping of the multimodal communication. First results show (1) positive effects on human’s understanding of the perceptual and cognitive foundation of agent’s behavior, and (2) the need for harmonizing the explanations to the context and human’s information processing capabilities.},

We found that Rwanda has a top down approach with the government leading the implementations. On the other hand Bangladesh has a more inclusive approach with feedback loop among all the stakeholders. Such difference in the approach is reflected in three main aspects: service design, collaboration with partners and sustainability. We propose that sustainable entrepreneurship using health and related information as a commodity among the community health workers, supported by long term planning and strategic partnerships.},

abstract = {Organizations increasingly rely on teams to solve problems creatively or design new products and services. Research to date has mostly focused on individual creativity, rather than team creativity. This paper introduces the Team Creativity Model (TCM) to understand the antecedents of team creativity. TCM posits that both individual creativity and shared mental models (SMMs) contribute to team creativity. SMMs act as a mediator between knowledge sharing and team creativity. Antecedents to individual creativity include an individual's propensity to be creative and individual knowledge. Individual knowledge also is an antecedent to knowledge sharing, as are an individual's propensity to share knowledge and trust within the team. In an exploratory study at a telecom company, a team of design experts participating in four creative sessions provided initial support for the TCM constructs and their relationships. The findings suggest that further exploratory and empirical research on TCM is justified. Some tentative implications for research and practice are presented.},
