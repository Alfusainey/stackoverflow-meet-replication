abstract = {Within Multi Agent Systems, communication by means of Agent Communication Languages (ACLs) has a key role to play in the co-operation, co-ordination and knowledge-sharing between agents. Despite this, complex reasoning about agent messaging, and specifically about conversations between agents, tends not to have widespread support amongst general-purpose agent programming languages.ACRE (Agent Communication Reasoning Engine) aims to complement the existing logical reasoning capabilities of agent programming languages with the capability of reasoning about complex interaction protocols in order to facilitate conversations between agents. This paper outlines the aims of the ACRE project and gives details of the functioning of a prototype implementation within the Agent Factory multi agent framework.},

abstract = {In this paper we present a context-aware tool designed for mapping and tagging objects and places of importance to rural communities using sensor-enabled mobile devices. These data sets comprise comprehensive models of specific environments which we use for creating interactive visualized knowledge sharing platforms for indigenous knowledge in Southern Africa. The tool was originally created for researchers to efficiently capture large amounts of data in the field, but we realized that true scalability of the approach would only be attained when including local users. The tool has been through multiple design iterations and in-situ evaluations across several locations in Namibia, and this paper presents findings from our research into the feasibility and effectiveness of the tool to capture meaningful localized data in an efficient and scalable way. From this we conclude that it is very promising when used by trained researchers, but that the interface will need to be significantly redesigned and appropriated for local community members.},

abstract = {Healthcare information is complex, distributed and non-structured in nature. Integration of information is important to retrieve patient history, for knowledge sharing and to formulate queries. Large scale adoption of electronic healthcare applications requires semantic interoperability. Interoperability of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) is important because patients have become mobile, treatment and health care providers have increased, and also, have become more specialized. The paper analyses the role of semantic interoperability in healthcare. The system modeling approach has been analyzed with a view of supporting system-to-system and user-system interactions. In addition, query interfaces have been considered at varying levels of user and system activities.},

abstract = {The modern enterprise is becoming larger and geographically distributed. The structure of companies is also becoming more complicated. Oraganizations are depending on knowledge within the enterprise and outside the enterprise. More and more individuals within organizations are parts of communities of practice which at times extend the boundaries of organizations. This necessitates people in the enterprise to have access to other individuals based on their roles and expertise [12]. Individuals within teams are constantly looking for sources of expertise that they don't have. In larger organizations, it becomes extremely difficult to identify the individuals that have the relevant expertise and get in touch with the individuals.Organizations and communities of practice have deployed knowledge management system to solve this problem with the belief that better implementation of information technologies [4] would result in more knowledge sharing and this would benefit the organizations. This has resulted in knowledge management research community being too focused on IT. A significant amount of knowledge is generated within the enterprise in communities of practice that consist of individuals both from within the enterprise and external to enterprise.There is no standard way to represent and access knowledge in the enterprise. Most of the knowledge within the enterprise resides in the form of documents, communications and in the mind of people. In this paper we define a way to represent the knowledge in the form of knowledge ontology. We also define system for generating knowledge networks that exist within the organization.},

But often the converse is also observed, where people choose to reveal true features of their identity, including deeply intimate details. This work attempts to explore several of the conditions that allow this to happen by analyzing the content generated by these users. We examine multiple social media on the Web, specifically focusing on Yahoo! Answers, encompassing more than a billion answers posted since 2006. Our analysis covers discussions of personal topics such as body measurements and income, and of socially sensitive subjects such as sexual behaviors. We offer quantitative proof that people are aware of the fact that they are posting sensitive information, and yet provide accurate information to fulfill specific information needs. Our analysis further reveals that on community question answering sites, when users are truthful, their expectation of an accurate answer is met.},

abstract = {In the era of knowledge economy, knowledge resources have become the most valuable assets for enterprises. To better understand and reuse knowledge, it is necessary to relate it with the context in which the knowledge is generated and used. This is a process that usually occurs in an experienced knowledge-worker's mind and without efficient supporting tools. This paper proposes an approach for the acquisition and utilization of context for the enhancement of knowledge and with a particular focus on methods to enable context extraction from industrial settings. The approach adopts a knowledge context ontology, to correlate knowledge and its context in the high-level activities of a knowledge worker. Knowledge context are extracted by utilizing a combination of methods including context identification, context reasoning, and context similarity measurement. Based on the proposed approach, a set of services for context aware knowledge enhancement are developed and applied in The Chinese Enterprise Management Tank (CEMT), a knowledge sharing and reusing platform for business management knowledge workers in all around China.},

Along with seven undergrad and graduate students involved in a course research group, the authors of this paper presented a fully functional online prototype of an application designed to connect those seeking knowledge work with those willing to do that work, creating an outlet for knowledge workers to share and contribute effort. Students were engaged as active co-designers in the system, examining existing applications online offering similar services, discussing relevant research in building online communities, and ultimately re-designing the system to make it context-appropriate for different deployment scenarios. This paper reports on the details of this unique design process, discussing its merits, implications, and the prototypes that resulted. The paper concludes with a discussion of the peer design process as an instructional approach that promotes student engagement.},

We adopt a representation of concepts alternative to n-grams and propose two concept-scoring functions based on semantic overlap. Experimental results on data drawn from Yahoo!

Our review makes it apparent that many different labels and conceptions exist in very different domains to explain the same phenomenon: the integrative power of visuals for knowledge-intensive collaboration processes. These concepts can be used to compile a list of the requirements of an effective knowledge visualization. We conclude the paper by showing the theoretical and practical implications of this review.},

abstract = {Community Question Answering (CQA) services have become popular methods to seek and share information. In CQA, users with an information need, or askers, post a question that community members can answer. This question-answering process allows both askers and answerers to learn through the exchange of information. CQA services have also been widely used in the education domain, as some of such services are designed specifically for students' information seeking. However, due to insufficient knowledge, lack of experience, and other reasons, students often struggle in producing quality or even appropriate content. This low quality production causes their content to be flagged or deleted, further discouraging them from participating in the CQA process and instigating a vicious cycle of bad users and bad content. In an effort to break this cycle, the work reported here focuses on identifying users whose postings demonstrate a high deletion rate with a presumption that the bad content is an indication of a struggling student rather than a malicious user. In this work, experiments are conducted on a large student-oriented online CQA community to understand struggling students' behaviors. A framework is proposed to find these users based solely on their activities. Finally, community feedback (i.e. human judgment) such as moderator evaluation or community votes for good content is used to detect these users in the early stages of their respective struggles. To evaluate this framework, we used data from Brainly, a large educational CQA service that is used in two different markets with more than 3.7 million users and 10.7 million answers. The results show that the human judgment feature identifies early-stage struggling users with high accuracy. Identifying these struggling users (students) could help educators to determine suitable ways to help their students instead of presuming them to be bad users and cutting them off from the community.},

abstract = {Increasing globalization creates situations with wide-ranging effects on large communities, often requiring global responses and innovative solutions. Timely examples are climate and environmental changes related to rapid growth and economic development. Natural and man-made unforeseen catastrophes like oil spills, landslides and floods require immediate action that might crucially rely on information and expertise available only from sources far removed from the crisis site. Knowledge sharing and transfer are also essential for sustainable long-term growth and development. In both kinds of cases, it is important that information and experience be made available and widely shared, communicated and encoded for future re-use. The global scope of many problems and their solutions requires furthermore that information and communication be accessible to communities crossing languages and cultures. Finally, an appropriate system for recording, maintaining and sharing information must be accessible to both experts and laymen.The goal of the European Union-funded KYOTO project (Knowledge-Yielding Ontologies for Transition-Based Organization, http://www.kyoto-project. eu) is to develop an information and knowledge sharing system that relates documents in several languages to lexical resources and a common central ontology and allows for deep semantic analysis. KYOTO facilitates the crosslinguistic and crosscultural construction and maintenance of a sophisticated knowledge system among the members of domain-specific communities. Representation, storage and retrieval of a shared terminology takes place via aWiki platform. Relevant terms are anchored in a language-independent, customizable formal ontology that connects the lexicons of seven languages (Basque, Chinese, Dutch, English, Italian, Japanese, and Spanish) and that guarantees a uniform interpretation of terms across languages. The semantic representations in the ontology are accessible to a computer and allow deep textual analysis and reasoning operations.KYOTO's target domains are the environment and biodiversity, with appropriate experts acting as 'users". Once developed, the system will be available for extension to any domain.},

abstract = {The challenge for many organizations today is ensuring that information and knowledge are shared across businesses as quickly and effectively as possible. Developing Knowledge Organization Systems (KOS) should eventually support knowledge sharing and learning at collective level. When analyzing and planning information systems, two roles of KOS need to be considered: knowledge maturing and interoperability. Knowledge Maturing can be described as goal-oriented learning on a collective level. Interoperability is defined as enabler which leads to knowledge flow, cooperation and eventually to a reduction of transaction costs. In line with the knowledge maturing model, we assume that stabilizing and dynamic forces co-exist in all organizations which seek a dynamic equilibrium between further development and stabilization. We assume that identifying and measuring these forces will help in the effective development of KOS and consequently support planning and development of information systems. We suggest ways of measuring these forces as existing and anticipated connectivity between nodes in Digital Business Ecosystems.},

In our settings, each member of the portfolio shares its best configuration (i.e., one which minimizes conflicting clauses) in a common structure. At each restart point, instead of classically generating a random configuration to start with, each algorithm aggregates the shared knowledge to carefully craft a new starting point. We present several aggregation strategies and evaluate them on a large set of problems.},

abstract = {We consider collaborative systems where users make contributions across multiple available projects and are rewarded for their contributions in individual projects according to a local sharing of the value produced. This serves as a model of online social computing systems such as online Q&amp;A forums and of credit sharing in scientific co-authorship settings. We show that the maximum feasible produced value can be well approximated by simple local sharing rules where users are approximately rewarded in proportion to their marginal contributions and that this holds even under incomplete information about the player’s abilities and effort constraints. For natural instances we show almost 95\% optimality at equilibrium. When players incur a cost for their effort, we identify a threshold phenomenon: the efficiency is a constant fraction of the optimal when the cost is strictly convex and decreases with the number of players if the cost is linear.},

abstract = {We study the problem of question retrieval in community question answering (CQA). The biggest challenge within this task is lexical gaps between questions since similar questions are usually expressed with different but semantically related words. To bridge the gaps, state-of-the-art methods incorporate extra information such as word-to-word translation and categories of questions into the traditional language models. We find that the existing language model based methods can be interpreted using a new framework, that is they represent words and question categories in a vector space and calculate question-question similarities with a linear combination of dot products of the vectors. The problem is that these methods are either heuristic on data representation or difficult to scale up. We propose a principled and efficient approach to learning representations of data in CQA. In our method, we simultaneously learn vectors of words and vectors of question categories by optimizing an objective function naturally derived from the framework. In question retrieval, we incorporate learnt representations into traditional language models in an effective and efficient way. We conduct experiments on large scale data from Yahoo! Answers and Baidu Knows, and compared our method with state-of-the-art methods on two public data sets. Experimental results show that our method can significantly improve on baseline methods for retrieval relevance. On 1 million training data, our method takes less than 50 minutes to learn a model on a single multicore machine, while the translation based language model needs more than 2 days to learn a translation table on the same machine.},

To address this, the paper aims to route questions to the right answerers who have a top rank in accordance of their previous answering performance. In order to rank the answerers, we propose a framework called Question Routing (QR) which consists of four phases: (1) performance profiling, (2) expertise estimation, (3) availability estimation, and (4) answerer ranking. Applying the framework, we conduct experiments with Yahoo!

Terminological ontology [1] is a tool used for knowledge sharing and domain-specific translation, and could potentially be suitable for simulating the cognitive models explaining real-world inter-cultural communication scenarios. In this paper, a framework referred to as the Relevance Theory of Communication [2] is contrasted to an empirical study applying Tversky s contrast model [3] to data-sets obtained from the terminological ontology. The results indicate that the alignment of two language-dependent terminological ontologies is a potential method for optimizing the relevance required in inter-cultural communication, in other words, for identifying corresponding concepts existing in two remote cultures.},

abstract = {Agile software development is known by focusing on interaction among team members to share knowledge. However, little guidance is provided to encourage interaction across agile teams. Based on a preliminary conceptual model, this paper examines influencing factors, such as organizational strategy, and communication flow and channels, regarding inter-team knowledge sharing (KS) effectiveness in agile environments. We analyze the characteristics and the influence of the mentioned factors through a survey research method. Data was gathered from seven Brazilian agile software organizations. We employed statistical analysis techniques, e.g., structural equation modeling and cross-table analysis, to analyze the results. Within the surveyed companies, organizational strategy reflects on moderate commitment towards knowledge. KS practices are carried out to an acceptable standard. Extensive communication flow and the use of several channels denote that agile companies are also fostering interaction across teams. We found strong relationship between these factors and the companies' experience on agile methods. As companies continue on an agile adoption program, they growingly focus on long-term goals and consider knowledge as strategic resource. However, they still need to improve strategy alignment to all organization levels. Thus, we recommend that agile companies consider these factors when striving on this endeavor.},

However, researchers have tended to use mostly mathematical and frequency-based techniques to examine the software artifacts contained within them. Objective: There is growing recognition that these approaches uncover only a partial picture of what happens during software projects, and deeper contextual approaches may provide further understanding of the intricate nature of software teams' dynamics. We demonstrate the relevance and utility of such approaches in this study. Method: We use psycholinguistics and directed content analysis (CA) to study the way project tasks drive teams' attitudes and knowledge sharing. We compare the outcomes of these two approaches and offer methodological advice for researchers using similar forms of repository data. Results: Our analysis reveals significant differences in the way teams work given their portfolio of tasks and the distribution of roles. Conclusion: We overcome the limitations associated with employing purely quantitative approaches, while avoiding the time-intensive and potentially invasive nature of field work required in full case studies.},

Specifically, we explore four different types of contextual factors, namely, the information novelty and non-redundancy modeling for local and non-local sentence interactions under question segmentation. To further unleash the potential of the abundant cQA features, we introduce the group L1 regularization for feature learning. Experimental results on a Yahoo!

By sharing the data summary that captures the global data distribution, each local site is able to identify large amounts of unqualified objects early.

If teachers’ knowledge management system based-on Blog is to be established as a long-term strategy, it must facilitate the development of the following factors simultaneously: knowledge transform, knowledge sharing, and effective instruction.In every higher educational institution, exchange of ideas and opinions between professors and students would definitely increase the possibilities for successful results. In the Blog-based knowledge management system, students get all kinds of necessary information and teachers get an effective knowledge share tool to create and share their knowledge base among themselves and with students. This paper will assess the advantage and methods for using Blog to improve teachers' knowledge management.},

To promote research and development of OMS, this paper defines its general framework and functional modules according to that of a database management system (DBMS). And it analyzes each OMS sub-module in details while considering integrity of the whole system. An OMS is a powerful tool to create ontologies and expand the application, scope and quality of existing ones.},

These issues are exacerbated when the projects are distributed globally and thus software development projects are multicultural. Globalization has increased the need to estimate the effectiveness and cost savings of every project. That is why many projects are outsourced or in other ways distributed to cheaper countries. The main problems of software development projects are related to knowledge sharing, communication, and cultural issues. This paper studies the challenges in global multicultural software development projects and the kinds of collaborative tools available for software development. This paper presents an examination of a collaboration model for global multicultural software development. The model is based on the authors' own work experience and literature research. We propose that this model could be used as a reference model when planning global software projects.},

abstract = {The importance of internships has grown during the last decade. Internships have a lot of benefits for both, the company and the intern as well. In order to get most out of an internship, it is important that knowledge, which is related to the job assignments, is efficiently transferred to the interns. The purpose of this study is to explore the processes of knowledge transfer to the interns based on Nonoka and Takeuchi's knowledge creation model with a focus on tacit to explicit knowledge transfer.The transfer of the required knowledge is twofold: firstly, interns must have access to already existing documents (rather explicit knowledge). Secondly, interns acquire knowledge through permanent transfer of knowledge from those who are highly experienced, like principals or workmates (rather tacit knowledge). This study used a qualitative approach to collect and analyze empirical data whereas two sources were used. In a first phase of the empirical survey a diary study with nine participants was carried out. In a following second phase semi-structured interviews with another 20 participants were conducted. The study represents the perspective of business informatics students who have to complete an internship as part of their studies.Participants state that the best experience of their internship is based on a combination of personal support, self-reliant working and the opportunity to have access to content or knowledge management systems. An intensive training phase conducted by co-workers or previous interns is perceived positively in gaining relevant knowledge for their internship. From a qualitative perspective the support of people was ranked on the first place. The technological aspects such as knowledge management tools actively support the process of knowledge sharing.},

Consequently, firms that use such repositories often implement validation procedures to monitor and ensure the quality of submitted content. However, if perceived as unreasonable or unfair, validation can have the unintended effect of discouraging employee contributions. Drawing on literature in knowledge sharing and organizational justice, we develop hypotheses about how various dimensions of perceived justice of validation procedures influence employees' perceptions of knowledge quality within the repository and their knowledge contributions to it. Analysis of survey data collected at a large North American technical support company reveals that both quality perceptions and contribution behaviors are positively influenced by perceived procedural justice of validation, but not by perceived informational or interpersonal justice. We conclude by discussing implications of these results for knowledge management research and practice.},

Question and Answer (Q&amp;A) sites form excellent repositories of collective knowledge. To make these sites self- sustainable and long-lasting, it is crucial to ensure that new users as well as the site veterans who provide most of the answers keep engaged with the site. As such, quantifying the engagement of users and preventing churn in Q&amp;A sites are vital to improve the lifespan of these sites. We study a large data collection from stackoverflow.com to identify significant factors that correlate with newcomer user churn in the early stage and those that relate to veterans leaving in the later stage. We consider the problem under two settings: given (i) the first k posts, or (ii) first T days of activity of a user, we aim to identify evidential features to automatically classify users so as to spot those who are about to leave. We find that in both cases, the time gap between subsequent posts is the most significant indicator of diminishing interest of users, besides other indicative factors like answering speed, reputation of those who answer their questions, and number of answers received by the user.},

Knowledge Management (KM) and Corporate Entrepreneurship (CE) are two strategic tools through which companies can concurrently exploit their competitive advantages while seeking potential opportunities. Since KM and CE practically help to improve organizational performance through their own resources, they seem not only interrelated but also influence each other. Therefore, an empirical survey was carried out among 51 Malaysian firms from different industrial sectors. In this study, Multiple Regressions is used to address the relationship between KM and CE. The results revealed that knowledge exploitation has significant positive relationship with innovation culture. However, there is no significant positive relationship between knowledge sharing culture and innovation culture. Similarly, both independent variables have no significant relationship with employees' interest in work innovation.},

We observe that different CQA services have their own knowledge focus and used different taxonomies to organize their question and answer pairs in their archives. As there are no simple semantic mappings between the taxonomies of the CQA services, the integration of CQA services is a challenging task. The existing approaches on integrating taxonomies ignore the hierarchical structures of the source taxonomy. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that is capable of incorporating the parent-child and sibling information in the hierarchical structures of the source taxonomy for accurate taxonomy integration. Our experimental results with real world CQA data demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods.},

abstract = {Improvements made in digital data processing resulted in the ability to store knowledge objects in sharing systems in the form of documents, images, audio and even video streams. However, with the increasing reliance on online knowledge sharing technologies, there is also an increasing danger that knowledge objects stored in digital forms are subjected to concerted malicious and possible criminal attacks. Digital knowledge objects can become easy prey to tampering and modifications which may defeat the original intent for knowledge sharing as well as causing loss of confidence among users. The preservation of the integrity of digital knowledge objects becomes increasingly important now than ever and the need has come for technologies to safeguard the authenticity and integrity of such objects. This paper proposes a model to incorporate automated detection and recovery mechanisms for tampered knowledge objects to make sure that knowledge-processing resources continue to perform correct processing operations at all times.},

abstract = {We present Expositor, a new debugging environment that combines scripting and time-travel debugging to allow programmers to automate complex debugging tasks. The fundamental abstraction provided by Expositor is the execution trace, which is a time-indexed sequence of program state snapshots. Programmers can manipulate traces as if they were simple lists with operations such as map and filter. Under the hood, Expositor efficiently implements traces as lazy, sparse interval trees, whose contents are materialized on demand. Expositor also provides a novel data structure, the edit hash array mapped trie, which is a lazy implementation of sets, maps, multisets, and multimaps that enables programmers to maximize the efficiency of their debugging scripts. We have used Expositor to debug a stack overflow and to unravel a subtle data race in Firefox. We believe that Expositor represents an important step forward in improving the technology for diagnosing complex, hard-to-understand bugs.},

abstract = {Community question answering portal (CQA) has become one of the most important sources for people to seek information from the Internet. With great quantity of online users ready to help, askers are willing to post questions in CQA and are likely to obtain desirable answers. However, the answer quality in CQA varies widely, from helpful answers to abusive spam. Answer quality assessment is therefore of great significance. Most of the existing approaches evaluate answer quality based on the relevance between questions and answers. Due to the lexical gap between questions and answers, these approaches are not quite satisfactory. In this paper, a novel approach is proposed to rank the candidate answers, which utilizes the support sets to reduce the impact of lexical gap between questions and answers. Firstly, similar questions are retrieved and support sets are produced with their high quality answers. Based on the assumption that high quality answers of similar questions would also have intrinsic similarity, the quality of candidate answers are then evaluated through their distance from the support sets in both aspects of content and structure. Unlike most of the existing approaches, previous knowledge from similar question-answer pairs are used to bridged the straight lexical and semantic gaps between questions and answers. Experiments are implemented on approximately 2.15 million real-world question-answer pairs from Yahoo! Answers to verify the effectiveness of our approach. The results on metrics of MAP@K and MRR show that the proposed approach can rank the candidate answers precisely.},

abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) aims at empowering anything to connect to the Internet and to collect data about itself and the environment in which it is situated. Therefore, the IoT has been producing a wide range of data. Our aim is to deliver a way of incorporating the small data generated by each thing into larger datasets to get more meaning out of these data. A thing, equipped with sensors, can be monitored and can record specific features regarding its behavior. Then it can insert data into a cloud database in order to provide individual-and collective-level analyses. We call this process "Quantified Things," and we present it as a new area for the application of "Quantified-Self" and "Quantified-Community" that are approaches of the IoT. In this paper, we provide an overview of the Quantified Things (QT) concept and the key requirements for the creation of QT applications. In addition, we present an agent-based model as a solution to meet such requirements. To illustrate the use of this model, we derived an example from one of the Quantified Things applications: "Quantified Fruit." Using the "Quantified Fruit" concept, some fruit storage use sensors to monitor environmental conditions, such as temperature, relative humidity, lighting and some gases that may affect fruit ripening. In turn, they insert these collected data into a cloud database and consequently enable knowledge sharing. Through these collective experiences, fruit storage may provide an advanced informative perspective on fruit shelf life based on local environmental conditions.},

abstract = {Community Question Answering (CQA) services, such as Yahoo! Answers and WikiAnswers, have become popular with users as one of the central paradigms for satisfying users' information needs. The task of question retrieval in CQA aims to resolve one's query directly by finding the most relevant questions (together with their answers) from an archive of past questions. However, as users can ask any question that they like, a large number of questions in CQA are not about objective (factual) knowledge, but about subjective (sentiment-based) opinions or social interactions. The inhomogeneous nature of CQA leads to reduced performance of standard retrieval models. To address this problem, we present a hybrid approach that blends several language modelling techniques for question retrieval, namely, the classic (query-likelihood) language model, the state-of-the-art translation-based language model, and our proposed intent-based language model. The user intent of each candidate question (objective/subjective/social) is given by a probabilistic classifier which makes use of both textual features and metadata features. Our experiments on two real-world datasets show that our approach can significantly outperform existing ones.},

Thereby, we pursue a structured analysis of applied state-of-the art matching techniques and the internal models of matching systems.The result is a comparison of matching systems, highlighting their commonalities and differences in terms of matching techniques and used information for matching, demonstrating significant similarities between the systems. Based on this, our work also identifies possible knowledge sharing between the domains, e. g. by describing techniques adoptable from another domain.},

abstract = {Community question answering (cQA) has become a popular service for users to ask and answer questions. In recent years, the efficiency of cQA service is hindered by a sharp increase of questions in the community. This paper is concerned with the problem of question routing. Question routing in cQA aims to route new questions to the eligible answerers who can give high quality answers. However, the traditional methods suffer from the following two problems: (1) word mismatch between the new questions and the users' answering history; (2) high variance in perceived answer quality. To solve the above two problems, this paper proposes a novel joint learning method by taking both word mismatch and answer quality into a unified framework for question routing. We conduct experiments on large-scale real world data set from Yahoo! Answers. Experimental results show that our proposed method significantly outperforms the traditional query likelihood language model (QLLM) as well as state-of-the-art cluster-based language model (CBLM) and category-sensitive query likelihood language model (TCSLM).},

We consider the artifact ecology that evolved from the Centre's common experimentation and data platform, the scientific practices, and the intricate interactions with digital artifacts that arise from the researchers' activities. We uncover the use of progress summaries for collaborative data interpretation and knowledge sharing. By studying this reputable collaborative scientific environment we (1) identified the factors that led to its functional and effective artifact ecology and (2) propose expansions of tools and services to improve it further. The latter include effective support for contextual search, browsing, and flexible viewing of information artifacts based on relevant parameters and properties.},

This paper presents methods for improving both the efficiency and accuracy of mutation analysis, an established method for assessing the quality of test cases for database schemas. Using a DBMS-independent abstract representation, the presented techniques automatically identify and remove mutants that are either equivalent to the original schema, redundant with respect to other mutants, or undesirable because they are only valid for certain database systems. Applying our techniques for ineffective mutant removal to a variety of schemas, many of which are from real-world sources like the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the Stack Overflow website, reveals that the presented static analysis of the DBMS-independent representation is multiple orders of magnitude faster than a DBMS-specific method. The results also show increased mutation scores in 75\% of cases, with 44\% of those uncovering a mutation-adequate test suite. Combining the presented techniques yields mean efficiency improvements of up to 33.7\%, with averages across schemas of 1.6\% and 11.8\% for HyperSQL and PostgreSQL, respectively.},

abstract = {Community Question Answering (CQA) has emerged as a popular type of service where users ask and answer questions and access historical question-answer pairs. CQA archives contain very large volumes of questions organized into a hierarchy of categories. As an essential function of CQA services, question retrieval in a CQA archive aims to retrieve historical question-answer pairs that are relevant to a query question. In this paper, we present a new approach to exploiting category information of questions for improving the performance of question retrieval, and we apply the approach to existing question retrieval models, including a state-of-the-art question retrieval model. Experiments conducted on real CQA data demonstrate that the proposed techniques are capable of outperforming a variety of baseline methods significantly.},

year = {2017},
publisher = {AAAI Press},
abstract = {In our daily life, short texts have been everywhere especially since the emergence of social network. There are countless short texts in online media like twitter, online Q&amp;A sites and so on. Discovering topics is quite valuable in various application domains such as content recommendation and text characterization. Traditional topic models like LDA are widely applied for sorts of tasks, but when it comes to short text scenario, these models may get stuck due to the lack of words. Recently, a popular model named BTM uses word cooccurrence relationship to solve the sparsity problem and is proved effectively. However, both BTM and extended models ignore the inside relationship between words. From our perspectives, more related words should appear in the same topic. Based on this idea, we propose a model named RIBSTM which makes use of RNN for relationship learning and IDF for filtering high-frequency words. Experiments on two real-world short text datasets show great utility of our model.},

abstract = {The proliferation of knowledge-sharing communities such as Wikipedia and the progress in scalable information extraction from Web and text sources have enabled the automatic construction of very large knowledge bases. Endeavors of this kind include projects such as DBpedia, Freebase, KnowItAll, ReadTheWeb, and YAGO. These projects provide automatically constructed knowledge bases of facts about named entities, their semantic classes, and their mutual relationships. They contain millions of entities and hundreds of millions of facts about them. Such world knowledge in turn enables cognitive applications and knowledge-centric services like disambiguating natural-language text, semantic search for entities and relations in Web and enterprise data, and entity-oriented analytics over unstructured contents. Prominent examples of how knowledge bases can be harnessed include the Google Knowledge Graph and the IBM Watson question answering system. This tutorial presents state-of-the-art methods, recent advances, research opportunities, and open challenges along this avenue of knowledge harvesting and its applications. Particular emphasis will be on the twofold role of knowledge bases for big-data analytics: using scalable distributed algorithms for harvesting knowledge from Web and text sources, and leveraging entity-centric knowledge for deeper interpretation of and better intelligence with Big Data.},

In general, opinion mining is quite context-sensitive, and, at a coarser granularity, quite domain dependent. This paper introduces a fine-grain approach for opinion mining, which uses the ontology structure as an essential part of the feature extraction process, by taking account the relations between concepts. The experiment result shows the benefits of exploiting ontology structure to opinion mining.},

To achieve this, it is proposed, as a solution, the FAOBP ontology to represent the student profile in the social network. This ontology obtained by the merge of AOBP and FOAF ontologies. Next step is the adoption of strategies to make available, in the network, knowledge about mobility issues.

In this work, we use data gathered from digg.com to present novel findings and draw important sociological conclusions regarding the intimate relationship between consumption and social networking. We first demonstrate that individuals' consumption habits influence their friend networks, consistent with the concept of homophily. We then show that one's social network can also influence the consumption of a submission through the activation of an extended friend network. Finally, we investigate the level of reciprocity, or balance, in the network and uncover relationships that are significantly less balanced than expected.},

abstract = {Serious Games for Learning are often designed as singleplayer, storytelling-based games. Even though immersion into the story and adaption to the player's abilities are pedagogically well designed, players can have misconceptions or get stuck with game quests. Then they seek for assistance from friends or online. Accessing hints, solutions and help of others directly in the gaming context can improve the game play and learning experience. Additionally the users from Online Social Networks can be connected to the game as a valuable resource of know-how if they are provided with participation possibilities. The concept of Peer Education is valuable for teaching and assessment among peers with similar learning targets. Thus in this paper an approach towards Social Serious Games is presented. Existing Social Media interaction patterns and singleplayer, story-based game situations are brought together respecting the Interaction Mapping Patterns1:1 and 1:n. The resulting three dimensional Social Game Influence Taxonomy is presented as well as the technical implementation as a middleware to connect existing Serious Games with Online Social Networks for Peer Knowledge Sharing and participation.},

In this paper, we propose a novel composite kernel to improve the accuracy in question matching. Our study illustrate that the composite kernel can efficiently capture both lexical semantics and syntactic information in a question sentence by leveraging word sequence kernel, POS tag sequence kernel and syntactic tree kernel. Experimental results on real world datasets show that our proposed method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art models.},

Yet, many of these needs could be addressed by asking people via popular Community Question Answering (CQA) services, such as Baidu Knows, Quora, or Yahoo! Answers. In this paper, we perform the first large-scale analysis of how searchers become askers. For this, we study the logs of a major web search engine to trace the transformation of a large number of failed searches into questions posted on a popular CQA site. Specifically, we analyze the characteristics of the queries, and of the patterns of search behavior that precede posting a question; the relationship between the content of the attempted queries and of the posted questions; and the subsequent actions the user performs on the CQA site. Our work develops novel insights into searcher intent and behavior that lead to asking questions to the community, providing a foundation for more effective integration of automated web search and social information seeking.},

Therefore, we extracted the egocentrism from language expressions in words at some Japanese Q&amp;A sites and tried to extract the gap of the mutual understanding in these words of business based on the egocentrism in this study. Specifically, we defined the weights for properties of presumed egocentrism with the method that presumes the egocentrism from language expressions in our previous study. We can presume the gap of the mutual understanding in the text data of business Q&amp;A sites that have dialogue form by using the weights and calculating the strength score of the egocentrism in speech unit. We also evaluated this method with text data of business world in real Q&amp;A sites and confirmed its effectiveness.},

abstract = {Nowadays information systems play a vital role for organizations and individuals, which is why their protection is becoming increasingly important. Often, solutions are developed for very similar problems over and over again. An exchange of knowledge between experts would be desirable in order to prevent developing always the same solutions by independent persons. Such an exchange could also lead to solutions of higher quality, as existing approaches could be advanced, instead of always reinventing the security wheel. This paper examines how machine-readable information security knowledge can be shared between different organizations on the basis of a web portal utilizing Web-Prot'{e}g'{e}. It can be shown that through the use of ontologies the domain of information security can be modeled and stored in a human- and a machine-readable format, enabling both human editing and automation (e.g. for risk calculations).

abstract = {This work presents an approach for representing and managing medical exceptions that may occur during the execution of a patient-centered care pathway. Personalized care pathways are generated automatically by means of a knowledge-driven planning process over a temporal hierarchical task network (HTN), which encodes an evidence-based clinical guideline. The exceptional situations specified in this guideline as well as the recommendations for their management are represented by knowledge-based rules in the task network model. However these rules, which encode the exceptional flow of the guideline, are represented separately from the normal flow in order to not obscure the modelling. Moreover, we propose the use of medical concepts from a standard terminology (UMLS) for the formal representation of these rules. This fact promotes interoperability, knowledge sharing and precision aspects. Finally, a therapy planning system with capabilities for exception detection, analysis and adaptation has been developed. As a result, the proposal, which is evaluated with oncology care plans, seems to be an adequate exception recovery mechanism maintaining guideline adherence.},

abstract = {Reconciling opinions from multiple sources on questions of interest to determine the correct answers is an important problem encountered in collaborative information systems such as Q \&amp; A forums and prediction markets. Our current work focuses on a widely applicable variant of the above problem where the opinions and answers are categorical-valued with the set of values possibly varying across questions. Most of the existing techniques are tailored only for binary opinions and cannot be effectively adapted for questions with categorical opinions. To address this, we propose a generic Bayesian framework for opinion reconciliation that can readily incorporate latent and observed attributes of sources and subjects. For the scenario of interest, we derive three specific model instantiations of the general approach (CTM, CTM-OSF, CTM-LSG), which respectively capture the latent source behavior, variations of source behavior across subject groups, and inter-source correlations. Empirical results on real-world datasets point to the relative superiority of the proposed models over existing baselines.},

"PART-OF" and "IS-A" hierarchical relations’ influence are considered on the semantic similarity in this paper. Breadth-first search is used to find the shortest path between two concepts. The similarity of hiberarchy and superposition are calculated respectively. WordNet3.0 is employed; JWNL1.4.1 is used to operate WordNet. According to the experiment against a benchmark set by human similarity judgment, our measure achieves a better result.},

This is the more so in agile environments, where there is an inherent tension between top-down development guidance through specifications and other means, and a bottom-up development and delivery of new features. In multi-site development, such may easily lead to mutual misunderstandings, an increase in errors and problem reports, and wasting resources on rework. I will report on knowledge sharing challenges we encountered in industry, in particular in a large multi-site development organization that develops software for the printing industry.},

abstract = {Online social networks (OSNs) such as Facebook, Twitter, Linked In, Google+, have become extremely popular and ubiquitous today. Users are actively connected to these services for creating and sharing contents and events with others, and, in some cases, this activity takes place in the scope of groups of interests. Therefore, from amongst the morass of data generated every day by users, a part of information may match the interests of certain groups. In practice, members are not all linked to each other via each OSN they are connected to. It is also not realistic to assume that each member can manually explore all others' social profiles to reach the information that may be relevant to their interests. Thus, there is a need for aggregating members' social streams on a single information support to collect relevant information, and, consequently, to promote collaborative knowledge-sharing. However, the disconnected nature of today social websites prevents a straightforward aggregation process. An efficient automated aggregation model is needed. We present, in this paper, the idea of empowering collaborative intelligence by the use of a user-centered approach for OSN aggregation. We illustrate the approach by a first experience to evaluate its impact on users information sharing and enrichment capabilities.},

Compared with the traditional knowledge-repository, the knowledge-network SNS transfers tacit knowledge learned in class from one to others. And more, the quantificated stickiness gives standards to strengthen teachers' knowledge-network; (1) picking up low-stickiness teachers for inviting into the network and (2) estimating stickiness of the system.},

It also created conditions and framework for cross-institutional cooperation, information exchange and knowledge sharing thus breaking traditional "silos" approach. Conclusions from the project confirmed medical and financial benefits of tele-ECG already described in literature. The project contributed to discussion on conditions for financing of remote medical procedures by National Health Fund and provided inputs into debate on the Polish e-health strategy. Still, necessary policy alignment allowing for wide adoption of tele-diagnostic medical procedures was not achieved, and significant effort in this area is necessary to deliver benefits to wide public.},

Knowledge can be captured and distributed using a variety of media, including traditional help files and manuals, videos, technical articles, wikis, and blogs. In recent years, web-based community portals have emerged as an important mechanism for combining various communication channels. However, there is little advice on how they can be effectively deployed in a software project.In this paper, we present a first study of a community portal used by a closed source software project. Using grounded theory, we develop a model that characterizes documentation artifacts along several dimensions, such as content type, intended audience, feedback options, and review mechanisms. Our findings lead to actionable advice for industry by articulating the benefits and possible shortcomings of the various communication channels in a knowledge-sharing portal. We conclude by suggesting future research on the increasing adoption of community portals in software engineering projects.},

However, little is known about how individual differences influence users' selection of online sources for health information. This study intends to fill this gap by exploring the impact of a number of individual characteristics on users' selection of five online sources (search engines, social Q&amp;A sites, social networking sites (SNSs), online health communities, and crowdsourcing sites) for three distinct types of health-related search task (factual, exploratory, and personal experiences). We found that individuals' health literacy and frequency of using a source are the most significant predictors of their source selections across task types. Preference for information has an impact on users' selection of SNSs for exploratory tasks. Extraversion personality has an impact on users' selection of search engines for tasks that seek personal experiences. Nevertheless, demographic factors, including gender, income, and health status, do not predict users' selection of online sources for health information.},

abstract = {Users tend to ask and answer questions in community question answering (CQA) services to seek information and share knowledge. A corollary is that myriad of questions and answers appear in CQA service. Accordingly, volumes of studies have been taken to explore the answer quality so as to provide a preliminary screening for better answers. However, to our knowledge, less attention has so far been paid to question quality in CQA. Knowing question quality provides us with finding and recommending good questions together with identifying bad ones which hinder the CQA service. In this paper, we are conducting two studies to investigate the question quality issue. The first study analyzes the factors of question quality and finds that the interaction between askers and topics results in the differences of question quality. Based on this finding, in the second study we propose a Mutual Reinforcement-based Label Propagation (MRLP) algorithm to predict question quality. We experiment with Yahoo!~Answers data and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm in distinguishing high-quality questions from low-quality ones.},

In this paper, we present a question routing scheme which takes into account the answering, commenting and voting propensities of the users. Unlike prior work which focuses on routing a question to the most desirable expert, we focus on routing it to a group of users - who would be willing to collaborate and provide useful answers to that question. Through empirical evidence, we show that more answers and comments are desirable for improving the lasting value of a question-answer thread. As a result, our focus is on routing a question to a team of compatible users. We propose a recommendation model that takes into account the compatibility, topical expertise and availability of the users. Our experiments over a large real-world dataset shows the effectiveness of our approach over several baseline models.},

abstract = {Plenty of open source libraries and frameworks are available for developers these days for reuse in their projects. However the difficulty in finding and reusing the correct API among the hundreds of available APIs far outweighs the advantage of saving time. The problem is acute in enterprise code base. Online forums like Stack Overflow are no help for enterprise source code as they are closed in nature. We have developed a tool called E-Xplore that addresses this issue by letting the programmers search in large source code base and browse them effectively. The tool also provides related artifacts in the form of result clustering. We evaluated E-Xplore with other tools via user study with developers working on an enterprise banking system with more than 10 million lines of code. A set of common tasks was given to the developers with and without the tool. We observed that the tool offered appreciable time and effort benefits in large scale software system development and maintenance. In this paper we describe the tool and its features which help develop and maintain source code effectively.},

In general, work-stealing frameworks provide efficient load balancing even for irregular parallel applications. Unfortunately, naive parallel programs for ``general computations'' governed by rewriting rules over configurations (system states) cause stack overflow or unacceptable load imbalance. In this study, we develop parallel programs to perform probabilistically balanced divide-and-conquer graph traversals. We propose a programming technique for accumulating overflowed calls for the next iteration of repeated parallel stages. In an emerging backtracking-based work-stealing framework called "Tascell," which avoids excessive concurrency, we propose a programming technique for long-term use of workspaces, leading a similar technique in the Cilk framework.},

abstract = {JavaScript frameworks, such as jQuery, are widely used for developing web applications. To facilitate using these JavaScript frameworks to implement a feature (e.g., functionality), a large number of programmers often search for code snippets that implement the same or similar feature. However, existing code search approaches tend to be ineffective, without taking into account the fact that JavaScript code snippets often implement a feature based on various relationships (e.g., sequencing, condition, and callback relationships) among the invoked framework API methods. To address this issue, we present a novel Relationship-Aware Code Search (RACS) approach for finding code snippets that use JavaScript frameworks to implement a specific feature. In advance, RACS collects a large number of code snippets that use some JavaScript frameworks, mines API usage patterns from the collected code snippets, and represents the mined patterns with method call relationship (MCR) graphs, which capture framework API methods’ signatures and their relationships. Given a natural language (NL) search query issued by a programmer, RACS conducts NL processing to automatically extract an action relationship (AR) graph, which consists of actions and their relationships inferred from the query. In this way, RACS reduces code search to the problem of graph search: finding similar MCR graphs for a given AR graph. We conduct evaluations against representative real-world jQuery questions posted on Stack Overflow, based on 308,294 code snippets collected from over 81,540 files on the Internet. The evaluation results show the effectiveness of RACS: the top 1 snippet produced by RACS matches the target code snippet for 46\% questions, compared to only 4\% achieved by a relationship-oblivious approach.},

abstract = {Nowadays, software development projects produce a large number of software artifacts including source code, execution traces, end-user feedback, as well as informal documentation such as developers' discussions, change logs, Stack-Overflow, and code reviews. Such data embeds rich and significant knowledge about software projects, their quality and services, as well as the dynamics of software development.Most often, this data is not organized, stored, and presented in a way that is immediately useful to software developers and project managers to support their decisions. To help developers and managers understand their projects, how they evolve, as well as support them during their decision-making process, software analytics -- use of analysis, data, and systematic reasoning for making decisions - has become an emerging field of modern data analysis. While results obtained from analytics-based solutions suggested so far are promising, there are still several challenges associated with the adoption of software analytics into software development processes, as well as the development and integration of analytics tools in practical settings.We therefore propose a tutorial on software analytics. The tutorial will start with an introduction of software analytics. Next, we will discuss the main challenges and opportunities associated with software analytics based on the examples from our own research. These examples will cover a range of topics leveraging software analytics. The topics include mobile apps quality, code review process and its quality, analytics for the software engineering Twitter space, as well as the use of analytics to solve scheduling problems in the cloud.},

Answers, are specifically designed to address the innate limitation of Web search engines by helping users obtain information from a community. Understanding the user intent of questions would enable a CQA system identify similar questions, find relevant answers, and recommend potential answerers more effectively and efficiently. In this paper, we propose to classify questions into three categories according to their underlying user intent: subjective, objective, and social. In order to identify the user intent of a new question, we build a predictive model through machine learning based on both text and metadata features. Our investigation reveals that these two types of features are conditionally independent and each of them is sufficient for prediction. Therefore they can be exploited as two views in co-training - a semi-supervised learning framework - to make use of a large amount of unlabelled questions, in addition to the small set of manually labelled questions, for enhanced question classification. The preliminary experimental results show that co-training works significantly better than simply pooling these two types of features together.},

abstract = {The primary purpose of the study was to construct Knowledge Sharing (KS) Platform. In addition, the attitude and perception about knowledge sharing of teachers who participate in the quasi-experimental study was explored. For accuracy of the research results, the researchers adopted several research methods including literature review, Modified Delphi Technique, quasi-experiment study and survey, when examining the research issue.The subjects for this study were two teachers from two classes of Department of Electrical Machinery in a vocational high school in Kaohsiung city, Taiwan, R.O.C. In order to conduct the survey of Modified Delphi Technique, a total of 10 questionnaires were mailed out to experts in a purposeful sampling. Based upon the result of the Modified Delphi survey, the KS platform was constructed. Then, teachers evaluated Self-evaluation Questionnaire of applying KS platform. The Cronbach alpha coefficient of the Self-evaluation Questionnaire was 0.94, suggesting the internal reliability to be quite acceptable. Thus, Data collected through the above two questionnaires was analyzed by Frequency, Mean, and Chi-square.The result of the research was as follows: By the statistic results of the Modified Delphi survey, the mean above 3 which could be regard as needed to construct the KS Platform have the following ten items: "lecture courses", "team teaching", "teachers research association", "courses development committee", "department meeting", "Q&amp;A", "teaching achievement exhibition", "communities of practice", "on-line information exchange", "study club", "chatting" and "diary". As to the above opinion, the 10 experts reached convergence. Based upon the above result of the Modified Delphi survey, the issues of "discussion board" "related linked websites", "search engine", "teaching database" and "electric newspaper" were constructed in the KS platform.After the analysis of the Self--evaluation Questionnaire, we found that two teachers of experimental group had positive attitude to knowledge sharing. This indicated that teachers were willing to implement the KS platform as an instructional tool. Finally, the conclusion was proposed.},

abstract = {This paper studies the problem of question retrieval in community question answering (CQA). To bridge lexical gaps in questions, which is regarded as the biggest challenge in retrieval, state-of-the-art methods learn translation models using answers under an assumption that they are parallel texts. In practice, however, questions and answers are far from "parallel". Indeed, they are heterogeneous for both the literal level and user behaviors. There are a particularly large number of low quality answers, to which the performance of translation models is vulnerable. To address these problems, we propose a supervised question-answer topic modeling approach. The approach assumes that questions and answers share some common latent topics and are generated in a "question language" and "answer language" respectively following the topics. The topics also determine an answer quality signal. Compared with translation models, our approach not only comprehensively models user behaviors on CQA portals, but also highlights the instinctive heterogeneity of questions and answers. More importantly, it takes answer quality into account and performs robustly against noise in answers. With the topic modeling approach, we propose a topic-based language model, which matches questions not only on a term level but also on a topic level. We conducted experiments on large scale data from Yahoo! Answers and Baidu Knows. Experimental results show that the proposed model can significantly outperform state-of-the-art retrieval models in CQA.},

Presence or lack of trust can have serious implications for organizations with respect to the quality and of their business processes. Several scientific works have confirmed the direct correlation between social-cognitive capital, in terms of competencies and experiences, and a feeling of trust in both learning and working collaborative environments. On the other hand, Competency-Based Management allows organizations to link human resources processes to competencies in order to shape its workforce capabilities and to achieve better results. Typically, employees' competencies (and proficiency levels) are stored and used by specific enterprise software, whereas the trust is not considered or left to managers' feeling. This work proposes an approach to the improvement of collaborative learning activities by refining and allowing (at workers' level) competency-finding processes through the social calculus of trust-in-competencies degree.},

The results of qualitative and quantitative analyses showed that while knowledge management practices include knowledge organizing, knowledge storage security, knowledge sharing intention and knowledge application were introduced as the important factors for implementing the e-Insurance based on the manager's opinion, the application of such practices in the place of the study is lower than average. Therefore, to fill this gap, managers need to pay more attention to implement the knowledge management practices in order to meet their goals of implementing e-Insurance.},

By leveraging the differing strengths of individual SAT solvers, portfolios employing older solvers have often fared as well or better than newly designed ones, in several categories of the annual SAT Competitions and Races. We propose two simple yet powerful techniques to further boost the performance of sequential portfolios, namely, a generic way of knowledge sharing suitable for sequential SAT solver schedules which is commonly employed in parallel SAT solvers, and a meta-level guardian classifier for judging whether to switch the main solver suggested by the portfolio with a recourse action solver. With these additions, we show that the performance of the sequential portfolio solver &lt;Emphasis FontCategory="NonProportional"&gt;3S&lt;/Emphasis&gt;, which dominated other sequential categories but was ranked 10th in the application category of the 2011 SAT Competition, can be boosted significantly, bringing it just one instance short of matching the performance of the winning application track solver, while still outperforming all other solvers submitted to the crafted and random categories.},

abstract = {List Comprehension is a succinct syntactic form to describe lists in functional languages. It uses nested generators (i.e., iterators) and filters (i.e., Boolean expressions). The former generates lists, whereas the latter restricts the contents of these lists. List Comprehension translation is commonly based on Wadler's rules that emit code based on recursive functions. This code often results either in stack overflow or in inefficient execution for many Common Lisp implementations.We present a very simple technique to compile List Comprehension in the Loop Facility of Common Lisp, resulting in efficient code that avoids stack overflow. Our translation code is also very short, with an emitted code very close to the user-specified list comprehension.We also present a translation into more fundamental constructs of Common Lisp that often results in even more efficient code, although this translation is more complex than using the Loop Facility.The author has used the first translation technique for compiling a new language called Bio Velo, which is part of bioinformatics software called Pathway Tools [2].},

abstract = {Existing community question-answering forums usually provide only textual answers. However, for many questions, pure texts cannot provide intuitive information, while image or video contents are more appropriate. In this paper, we introduce a scheme that is able to enrich text answers with image and video information. Our scheme investigates a rich set of techniques including question/answer classification, query generation, image and video search reranking, etc. Given a question and the community-contributed answer, our approach is able to determine which type of media information should be added, and then automatically collects data from Internet to enrich the textual answer. Different from some efforts that attempt to directly answer questions with image and video data, our approach is built based on the community-contributed textual answers and thus it is more feasible and able to deal with more complex questions. We have conducted empirical study on more than 3,000 QA pairs and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.},

To achieve this goal, the following methods were applied: literature review, Delphi survey, professional interview and sampling questionnaire survey. Through the structure equation modeling (SEM) with two-order confirmatory factor analysis, validity and reliability analysis, the model was tested with good fit, and the contents were certainly a second-order factor of health technology literacy, including first-order factors, that is, cognition, innovation propensity, health belief and knowledge sharing. And then, by using a survey method with cluster and stratified random sampling from 16 technological colleges in Taiwan, 3, 600 questionnaires were sent out, and 3, 012 effective questionnaires were returned; the survey reached 83.67\% of return-ratio. The results indicated that the students' literacy content of health technology consisted of cognition, innovation propensity, belief and knowledge sharing, according to the theories of planning behavior, social cognition, innovative diffusion, technology acceptance and health belief. The model of students' literacy contents of health technology was tested with good fit via the structural equation modeling (SEM), and it revealed, via SEM test, that a scale could be developed with high validity and reliability to examine the current situation of students' literacy about health technology. Finally, conclusions and suggestions were advanced as references for the curriculum teaching and research in universities and industries in order to benefit the teachers and practitioners in mobile learning.},

However it is very difficult, even for a large organization, to plan the equilibrium of competencies in terms of knowledge and behaviours needed inside a particular market. We propose a business model of a distributed network of partners, organizations and individuals, and a knowledge based management system to dynamically find and maintain the equilibrium between generalization and specialization while organizations in the business model work on opportunities. In meantime we depict, as a part of the system, the processes to face with the problem of knowledge protection towards competitors. Such a distributed network of partners will be the best way to face both the problems of generalization/specialization and knowledge sharing/protection. The paper details roles and other items of the K-based management System in the designed framework.},

However, ontology construction is a big challenge, especially in collaborative ontology development, in which conflicts are often a problem. Traditional collaborative methods are suitable for centralized teamwork only, and are ineffective if the ontology is developed and maintained by mass broadly distributed participators lacking communications. In this kind of highly collaborative ontology development, automated conflicts detection is essential. In this paper, we propose an approach to classify and detect collaborative conflicts according to some mechanisms: 1) impact range of a revision, 2) semantic rules, and 3) heuristic similarity measures. Also we present a high effective detecting algorithm with evaluation.},

Empirical software engineering researchers can mine the artifacts from these tools to better understand how FLOSS is made. As the landscape of distributed software development has grown and changed, the tools needed to make FLOSS have changed as well. There are three newer tools at the center of FLOSS development today: distributed version control based forges (like Github), programmer question-and-answer communities (like Stack Overflow), and paste bin tools (like Gist or Pastebin.com). These tools are extending and changing the toolset used for FLOSS development, and redefining what a software forge looks like. The main contributions of this paper are to describe each of these tools, to identify the data and artifacts available for mining from these tools, and to outline some of the ways researchers can use these artifacts to continue to understand how FLOSS is made.},

In this paper, a novel information-theoretic multi-task learning model, i.e. IBMTL, is proposed. The key idea of IBMTL is to minimize the loss mutual information during the classification, while constrain the Kullback Leibler divergence between multiple tasks to some maximal level. The basic trade-off is between maximize the relevant information while minimize the "dissimilarity" between multiple tasks. The IBMTL algorithm is compared with TrAdaBoost which extends AdaBoost for transfer learning. The experiments were conducted on two data sets for transfer learning, Email spam-filtering data set and sentiment classification data set. The experimental results demonstrate that IBMTL outperforms TrAdaBoost.},

Due to this popularity it is critical to help the identification of best answers to existing questions for simplifying the access to relevant information.Although it is possible to identify relatively accurately best answers by using binary classifiers coupled with user, content and thread} features, existing works have generally ignored to incorporate the thread-like structure of Q&amp;A communities in the design of best answer identification predictors and algorithms.This paper investigates this particular issue by studying structural normalisation techniques for improving the accuracy of feature based best answer identification models.Thread-based normalisation methods are introduced for improving the accuracy of identification models by introducing a systematic normalisation approach that normalise predictors by taking into account relations between features and the thread-like structure of Q&amp;A communities.Compared to similar non normalised models, better results are obtained for each of the three communities studied. These results show that structural normalisation methods can improve the identification of best answers compared to non-normalised models.},

And the results (decisions or actions) based on practical knowledge sometimes conflict. The aim of this research is to develop an intelligent system to support externalizing practical wisdom, and sharing this wisdom among medical experts. In this paper, the authors propose a method to model each medical staff member's sense of values as his/her way of task-grasp (or task-perception) in medical service workflow, and to obtain the practical knowledge using ontological models. The method was tested by developing a knowledge-sharing system based on the method and running it at Miyazaki University Hospital.},

abstract = {MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play important roles in various biological processes by regulating their target genes. Therefore, miRNAs are closely associated with development, diagnosis, and prognosis for many diseases. The prediction of miRNA targets remains a challenging task for biologists because it involves an extremely large amount of data sources to be explored: to manually integrate information of identified targets and related information from various sources is time-consuming and error-prone; most of all, it is subject to biologists' limited prior knowledge. In this paper we investigated an ontology-based knowledge sharing framework to assist biologists in unraveling important roles of miRNAs in human disease in an automated and more efficient manner, (i) We developed the very first domain-specific ontologies in the miRNA field, Ontology for MicroRNA Target (OMIT), (ii) According to the global metadata model defined in ontologies, heterogeneous data sources were annotated and seamlessly integrated and stored into a central Resource Description Framework (RDF) data repository, (iii) We then enabled ontology-based queries, instead of traditional SQL queries, by inferring new statements from RDF data triples. Consequently we were able to acquire hidden knowledge originally implicit and unclear, yet critical, to biologists.},

In these communities, there are typically a small number of experts amongst the large population of users. We study which questions a user select for answering and show that experts prefer answering questions where they have a higher chance of making a valuable contribution. We term this preferential selection as question selection bias and propose a mathematical model to estimate it. Our results show that using Gaussian classification models we can effectively distinguish experts from ordinary users over their selection biases. In order to estimate these biases, only a small amount of data per user is required, which makes an early identification of expertise a possibility. Further, our study of bias evolution reveals that they do not show significant changes over time indicating that they emanates from the intrinsic characteristics of users.},

An increasing need of cooperation and resource sharing is emerging in the electromagnetic arena as well. The range of potential semantic-based applications seems to be wide and the knowledge to be codified is complex and diverse. Therefore the implementation of a well structured ontology in the electromagnetic domain is important. This paper describes a proposal for an electromagnetic ontology framework. The main design criteria were reusability and shareability, in order to make electromagnetic knowledge embeddable in larger and more general frameworks. The implementation of an ontology for aperture-antenna array design is provided as a specific example of a practical application.},

abstract = {This paper presents an ontology-based approach to promote the interoperability among agents that represent their knowledge through Bayesian networks. This research relies on semantic web foundations to achieve knowledge interoperability in the context of multiagent systems. Our first step was the specification of an ontology that formalizes the structures of the Bayesian network representation. Once handled the issue of the knowledge representation, we specify how a Bayesian agent operates such representation. Thus, we define a model of internal architecture to support Bayesian agents in the knowledge sharing and maintenance tasks.},

abstract = {We propose a hierarchical auto-tagging system, TagHats, to improve users' knowledge sharing. Our system assigns three different levels of tags to Q&amp;A documents: category, theme, and keyword. Multiple category tags can organize a document according to multiple viewpoints, and multiple theme and keyword tags can identify what the document is about clearly. Moreover, these hierarchical tags will be helpful in organizing documents to support everyone because different users have different demands in terms of tag specificity. Our system consists of a hierarchical classification method for assigning category and theme tags, a new keyword extraction method that considers the structure of Q&amp;A documents, and a new method for selecting theme tag candidates from each category. Experiments with the documents of Oshiete! goo demonstrate that our system is able to assign hierarchical tags to the documents appropriately and is capable of outperforming baseline methods significantly.},

First, you get what you pay for in Q&amp;A sites. Answer quality was typically higher in Google Answers (a fee-based site) than in the free sites we studied, and paying more money for an answer led to better outcomes. Second, we find that a Q&amp;A site's community of users contributes to its success. Yahoo!

Many solutions have been proposed to protect against a direct stack smashing attack overwriting a return address. In this paper, we present a new approach against stack overrun. Our new countermeasure does not rely on exception handle (Such as Safe SEH) or secret values (Such as canaries). Our opinion separates the standard stack to two parts, original stack saves the return address and the address of buffer with read permissions only, and the true values of buffer we save in other space. Then the former saved address as a pointer link to our space of the values in buffer. This approach synthesizes several customized protections against stack overflow.},

From the view of facilitating knowledge sharing and reusing, modularization is introduced into ontology.

Thus, a novel approach for semi-automatic decomposition of ontology into modules, which takes fuzzily computing concept semantic similarity based ontology as the base, is proposed in this paper. Meanwhile, knowledge base based fuzzy and modular ontology is established. Finally, through a experiment on Grab Ontology the method's validity is proved.},

HiRBF is constructed under a hierarchical Bayesian framework. In the model all tasks are combined in a single RBF network. The input-to-hidden weights are shared between tasks, and the hidden-to-output weights are assumed to be sampled randomly from a certain prior distribution. The HiRBF algorithm is compared with two transfer-unaware approaches. The experiments demonstrate that HiRBF significantly outperforms the others.},

In this paper we present an architecture and a system implementation based on semantic technologies which allows a seamless information and knowledge sharing between VEA in a PLC scenario. Our approach is validated through a Plant Layout Design application which is able to collect knowledge provided by different VEA available.

abstract = {User votes are important signals in community question-answering (CQA) systems. Many features of typical CQA systems, e.g. the best answer to a question, status of a user, are dependent on ratings or votes cast by the community. In a popular CQA site, Yahoo! Answers, users vote for the best answers to their questions and can also thumb up or down each individual answer. Prior work has shown that these votes provide useful predictors for content quality and user expertise, where each vote is usually assumed to carry the same weight as others. In this paper, we analyze a set of possible factors that indicate bias in user voting behavior -- these factors encompass different gaming behavior, as well as other eccentricities, e.g., votes to show appreciation of answerers. These observations suggest that votes need to be calibrated before being used to identify good answers or experts. To address this problem, we propose a general machine learning framework to calibrate such votes. Through extensive experiments based on an editorially judged CQA dataset, we show that our supervised learning method of content-agnostic vote calibration can significantly improve the performance of answer ranking and expert ranking.},

year = {2012},
publisher = {AAAI Press},
abstract = {Automatic Subjective Question Answering (ASQA), which aims at answering users' subjective questions using summaries of multiple opinions, becomes increasingly important. One challenge of ASQA is that expected answers for subjective questions may not readily exist in the Web. The rising and popularity of Community Question Answering (CQA) sites, which provide platforms for people to post and answer questions, provides an alternative to ASQA. One important task of ASQA is question subjectivity identification, which identifies whether a user is asking a subjective question. Unfortunately, there has been little labeled training data available for this task. In this paper, we propose an approach to collect training data automatically by utilizing social signals in CQA sites without involving any manual labeling. Experimental results show that our data-driven approach achieves 9:37\% relative improvement over the supervised approach using manually labeled data, and achieves 5:15\% relative gain over a state-of-the-art semi-supervised approach. In addition, we propose several heuristic features for question subjectivity identification. By adding these features, we achieve 11:23\% relative improvement over word n-gram feature under the same experimental setting.},

abstract = {Given a newly posted question on a Question and Answer (Q&amp;A) site, how long will it take until an answer is received? Does response time relate to factors about how the question asker composes their question? If so, what are those factors? With advances in social media and the Web, Q&amp;A sites have become a major source of information for Internet users. Response time of a question is an important aspect in these sites as it is associated with the users' satisfaction and engagement, and thus the lifespan of these online communities. In this paper we study and estimate response time for questions in StackOverflow, a popular online Q&amp;A forum where software developers post and answer questions related to programming. We analyze a long list of factors in the data and identify those that have clear relation with response time. Our key finding is that tag-related factors, such as their "popularity" (how often the tag is used) and the number of their "subscribers" (how many users can answer questions containing the tag), provide much stronger evidence than factors not related to tags. Finally, we learn models using the identified evidential features for predicting the response time of questions, which also demonstrate the significance of tags chosen by the question asker.},

abstract = {Community question answering (CQA) has become a very popular web service to provide a platform for people to share knowledge. In current CQA services, askers post their questions to the system and wait for answerers to answer them passively. This procedure leads to several drawbacks. Since new questions are presented to all users in the system, the askers can not expect some experts to answer their questions. Meanwhile, answerers have to visit many questions and then pick out only a small part of them to answer. To overcome those drawbacks, a probabilistic framework is proposed to predict best answerers for new questions. By tracking answerers' answering history, interests of answerers are modeled with the mixture of the Language Model and the Latent Dirichlet Allocation model. User activity and authority information is also taken into consideration. Experimental results show the proposed method can effectively push new questions to the best answerers.},

abstract = {Collaborators on cross-disciplinary, cross-organizational teams must decide what knowledge is sharable. The sharability of a set of private knowledge is defined as the degree to which one feels willing to reveal that knowledge to people who are not members of one's own organizational unit. This paper proposes a Value Frequency Model of Knowledge Sharing (VFKS) to explain knowledge sharability and sharing. It reports qualitative findings from an exploratory field study of the degree to which constructs and relationships proposed by the model were consistent with the attitudes, opinions, and reported actions of professional Chief Knowledge Management Officers (CKMO) from 16 organizations in France. CKMO's were consistent with most aspects of the model, suggesting quantitative investigation of the model may be useful. Critical incidents and utterances of the CKMO's did not address two constructs in the model during this study. Further investigation may show whether these effects manifest in other contexts.},

The structured entities are represented by data structures called qualia, culture, and ethnicGroup, based on fine-grained lexical semantics [16,19]. As a result, we can not only specify the conceptualizations relating to each culture and ethnic group for knowledge sharing, but also we can define functions treating and transforming qualia, culture and ethicGroup by using a type-theoretical framework including implementation by functional programming.},

abstract = {In complex natural systems (such as ecological systems) it is common for those studying the macro-dynamics of systems to aim to describe, as simply as possible, the interactions between individuals occupying different niches in a system and to validate these by studying whether they account for the complex network of relationships observed in the actual system. We explore a similar principle applied to multi-agent systems: we develop interactions among intelligent agents; these interactions produce complex networks of relationships among the entities in the system in a similar fashion in which ecological networks are formed in nature. The study of the topological features displayed by these networks is helpful for determining the stability of the system of software agents and its relation to the complexity of the network itself. An interaction centred approach for coordination and knowledge sharing among artificial agents is adopted for the implementation of the system.},

Based on users' book-loan history in a university library, we could build a book-borrowing network between users and books. Furthermore, users who borrow the same books are linked together. The users and links then form a co-borrowing network which can be regarded as a knowledge sharing network. Both the book-borrowing network and the co-borrowing network can be used to study users' bookloan behavior patterns. This paper presents a study in analyzing users' book-loan behaviors and mining knowledge dependency between schools and degrees in Peking University. The mining work is based on the book-borrowing network and its corresponding co-borrowing network. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first work to mine knowledge dependency in digital library domain.},

An open forum can facilitate knowledge sharing, but there are no features for maintaining the trace of peer-to-peer assistance.

abstract = {The mining of software repository involves the extraction of both basic and value-added information from existing software repositories. Depending on stakeholders (e.g., researchers, management), these repositories are mined several times for different application purposes. To avoid unnecessary pre-processing steps and improve productivity, sharing, and integration of extracted facts and results are needed. The motivation of this research is to introduce a novel collaborative sharing platform for software datasets that supports on-the-fly inter-datasets integration. We want to facilitate and promote a paradigm shift in the source code analysis domain, similar to the one by Wikipedia in the knowledge-sharing domain. In this paper, we present the SeCold project, which is the first online, publicly available software ecosystem Linked Data dataset. As part of this research, not only theoretical background on how to publish such datasets is provided, but also the actual dataset. SeCold contains about two billion facts, such as source code statements, software licenses, and code clones from over 18.000 software projects. SeCold is also an official member of the Linked Data cloud and one of the eight largest online Linked Data datasets available on the cloud.},

abstract = {Ideally, we can learn lessons from software projects across multiple organizations. However, a major impediment to such knowledge sharing are the privacy concerns of software development organizations. This paper aims to provide defect data-set owners with an effective means of privatizing their data prior to release. We explore MORPH which understands how to maintain class boundaries in a data-set. MORPH is a data mutator that moves the data a random distance, taking care not to cross class boundaries. The value of training on this MORPHed data is tested via a 10-way within learning study and a cross learning study using Random Forests, Naive Bayes, and Logistic Regression for ten object-oriented defect data-sets from the PROMISE data repository. Measured in terms of exposure of sensitive attributes, the MORPHed data was four times more private than the unMORPHed data. Also, in terms of the f-measures, there was little difference between the MORPHed and unMORPHed data (original data and data privatized by data-swapping) for both the cross and within study. We conclude that at least for the kinds of OO defect data studied in this project, data can be privatized without concerns for inference efficacy.},

abstract = {Software is created by people and for people. People are heterogeneous in their beliefs, backgrounds, and preferences. Accommodating and exploiting the social variety is crucial for successful engineering and usage of software. On the one hand, software engineering is a social activity, performed by different individuals and teams. This necessitates methodologies and tools to deal with issues such as communication, coordination, knowledge sharing, compensation, and reconciliation. On the other hand, Social Software (Internet Forums, Wikis, Social Networks, Blogs, etc.) is an expanding computing paradigm, which inherently incorporates intensive social interactions and implications. Engineering Social Software magnifies a spectrum of challenges like group requirements engineering, social-awareness, privacy, security, and trust.Both directions -- engineering Social Software and treating software engineering as a social activity -- require competency from other disciplines as diverse as psychology, sociology, and organizational science. While both directions receive considerable attention, research in both fields is fragmented, uncoordinated, and partially redundant. The goal of this workshop is to confluence the research on social aspects in software engineering and engineering of Social software into a new field of Social Software Engineering (SSE).},

To address these limitations, we introduce Meta: a language extension for Python that allows programmers to share functions and track how they are used by a crowd of other programmers. Meta functions are shareable via URL and instrumented to record runtime data. Combining thousands of Meta functions with their collective runtime data, we demonstrate tools including an optimizer that replaces your function with a more efficient version written by someone else, an auto-patcher that saves your program from crashing by finding equivalent functions in the community, and a proactive linter that warns you when a function fails elsewhere in the community. We find that professional programmers are able to use Meta for complex tasks (creating new Meta functions that, for example, cross-validate a logistic regression), and that Meta is able to find 44 optimizations (for a 1.45 times average speedup) and 5 bug fixes across the crowd.},

In this paper, we present ActivitySpace, a remembrance framework that unobtrusively tracks and analyze a developer's daily work in separate applications, and provides various semantic and episodic UIs that help developers correlate and re-find cross-cutting information across applications based on information content, time and place of his/her activities. Through a user study of 8 participants, we demonstrate how ActivitySpace helps to tackle information fragmentation problem in developers' daily work.Tool website: http://baolingfeng.weebly.com/ase2015-demonstration.html},

The intermediate level that is responsible of correlating the alerts coming from different domains of the infrastructure and to deploy the reaction actions. The architecture is elaborated using a MAS associated to the OntoBayes model for decision mechanism. This model helps agents to make decisions according to preference values and is built upon ontology based knowledge sharing, Bayesian networks based uncertainty management and influence diagram. The major novelty of this Decision Support System is the layered view of the infrastructure thanks to MAS architecture, which enables the decision making with different levels of knowledge.},

In an effort to characterize and understand these differences we examine two Google-led projects, Android and Chromium OS, three Microsoft projects, Bing, Office, and MS SQL, and projects internal to AMD. We contrast our findings with data taken from traditional software inspection conducted on a Lucent project and from open source software peer review on six projects, including Apache, Linux, and KDE. Our measures of interest include the review interval, the number of developers involved in review, and proxy measures for the number of defects found during review. We find that despite differences among projects, many of the characteristics of the review process have independently converged to similar values which we think indicate general principles of code review practice. We also introduce a measure of the degree to which knowledge is shared during review. This is an aspect of review practice that has traditionally only had experiential support. Our knowledge sharing measure shows that conducting peer review increases the number of distinct files a developer knows about by 66\% to 150\% depending on the project. This paper is one of the first studies of contemporary review in software firms and the most diverse study of peer review to date.},

The ties with the external organizations and internal firms of the supply chain create the external social capital and it conduces getting the external knowledge; the firm’s internal ties create the internal social capital and it aids knowledge sharing among the employees.

abstract = {The fundamental issue of knowledge sharing in the web is the ability to share the ontological constrains associated with the Uniform Resource Identifiers (URI). To maximize the expressiveness and robustness of an ontological system in the web, each ontology should be ideally designed for a confined conceptual domain and deployed with minimal dependencies upon others. Through a retrospective analysis of the existing design of BioPAX ontologies, we illustrate the often encountered problems in ontology design and deployment. In this paper, we identify three design principles --- minimal ontological commitment, granularity separation, and orthogonal domain --- and two deployment techniques --- intensionally normalized form (INF) and extensionally normalized form (ENF) --- as the potential remedies for these problems.},

abstract = {OWL ontologies are used to represent knowledge in web. In recent years, with the wide application of Semantic Web, large numbers of OWL ontologies have appeared on Internet, especially, in some virtual knowledge communities. These ontologies are distributed in different sites and provide an amount of knowledge to query. But, it has become a pressing issue that, given a semantic query, how to efficiently gather the related knowledge from these ontologies located in different sites to process it. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose a P2P-based approach to publish axioms in sharable ontologies and freely sharing them in an open distributed environment. Given a query of SPARQL, this approach can automatically gather published axioms related to the query to process the query. As a knowledge sharing approach, our approach can directly share axioms coming from different ontologies on different nodes. It overcomes limitations of those approaches which focus on how to locate related ontologies for a query. We also conducted two experiments to evaluate the effectiveness and the efficiency of our approach. The experimental results demonstrated that it is effective and efficient.},

The focal point of the DLN performance is efficiency of knowledge processing in asynchronous learning mode and facilitating cooperation between students. In addition, the DLN articulates attention to social aspects of the learning process as well. In this paper, a method for the DLN development is proposed. The main research objectives for the proposed method are the processes of acceleration of social collaboration and knowledge sharing in the DLN. The method introduces knowledge-disposed agents (who represent students in educational scenarios) that form a network of individuals aimed to increase their competence. For every agent the competence expansion process is formulated. Based on that outcome the process of dynamic network formation performed on the social and knowledge levels. The method utilizes formal apparatuses of competence set and network game theories combined with an agent system-based approach.},

We illustrate our point with an ethnographical field study analyzing the European Social Forum (ESF), a network of political activist organizations. In this network different actors organize a periodic (biannual) event in which some 13,000 activists participated in 2008. We investigate how knowledge about organizing and managing the ESF is transferred between two events respectively, the actors and communities involved. Our study highlights the specific challenges in sharing nomadic knowledge and the consequences of deficiencies on the organizing process.

As the performance of a system is affected by multiple factors on each layer of the system, performance analysts require detailed knowledge about the system under test and have to deal with a huge number of tools for benchmarking, monitoring, and analyzing. In practice, performance analysts try to handle the complexity by focusing on certain aspects, tools, or technologies. However, these isolated solutions are inefficient due to the small reuse and knowledge sharing. The Performance Cockpit presented in this paper is a framework that encapsulates knowledge about performance engineering, the system under test, and analyses in a single application by providing a flexible, plug-in based architecture. We demonstrate the value of the framework by means of two different case studies.},

abstract = {Reputation is a complex concept that has a major role in fields like social sciences, economics as well as computer science. Representing it as a simple form of property-rating or a vector of ratings strips it from its original notion and postulation. It does not also facilitate the derivation of meaningful conclusions from it. This paper presents a semantic model for the representation of reputation as a complex object - a so called Reputation Object (RO). We also argue that using ontologies, and other semantic web technologies, to represent the reputation object model is essential to achieve reputation interoperability and portability between different domains. The contribution is a semantic design artifact for reputation representation that agrees with the theoretical and social formation and processing of reputation information. We also show some applications and how this ontology-based reputation model can be applied in a rule-based open reputation system. The work presented here has significant implications for e-market studies of knowledge sharing.},

The success of collaborative content creation such as Wikipedia shows the level of user's accomplishments in knowledge sharing and socialization. In this paper we extend this research in the service domain, to explore users' social behavior in Collaborative User-Generated Services (Co-UGS). We create a model which is derived from a real social network with its behavior being similar to that of Co-UGS. The centrality approach of social network analysis is used to analyze Co-UGS simulation on this model. Three Co-UGS network actors are identified to distinguish users according to their reactions to a service, i.e. ignoring users, sharing users and co-creating users. Moreover, six hypotheses are proposed to keep the Co-UGS simulation. The results show that the Co-UGS network constructed by the sharing and co-creating users is a connected group superimposed on the basis of the social network of users. In addition, the feasibility of this simulation method is demonstrated along with the validity of applying social network analysis to the study of users' social behavior in Co-UGS.},

The vision of Enterprise 2.0 places a high value on the importance of social networks inside and outside the organization stimulating flexibility, adaptability and innovation between workers, managers, customers, suppliers and consultants. The integration between the Web 2.0 tools with traditional enterprise software, the aggregation of organization inner data with external data and the choice of adequate knowledge representations are critical aspects to be faced in order to further the growth of smart applications in the Enterprise 2.0 context.

The findings indicate that forum members have different knowledge levels in the 2D or 3D design fields. The numbers of forum members willing to reply Q&amp;A questions on a forum discussion board may be an indicator of the quality of active operation of the forum. Finally, this study suggests posting some senior forum members' identities (photo and personal information) with their consent. In addition, results indicate enhancements to the functions of forums' discussion boards would allow automatic categorization of proposed Q&amp;A questions and then directly send them to the proper senior members via email.

However, only very recently, solutions for scalability of ontology alignment have begun to emerge. The goal of this research is to investigate scalability issues in alignment of large-scale ontologies. We present an alignment algorithm that bounds processing by selecting optimal subtrees to align and show that this significantly improves efficiency without major reduction in precision. We apply the algorithm in conjunction with our approach that includes modeling ontology alignment in a Support Vector Machine.},

abstract = {The proposed VANET IR-CAS is a context aware system that utilizes information retrieval (IR) techniques, such as indexing, document scoring and document similarity, to enhance context aware information dissemination in VANET. It uses a hybrid context model; spatial model for service filtering, ontology model for context reasoning and knowledge sharing, markup model for file exchange, and situational model for safety and convenience services. Its VANET OWL ontology managed by Jena semantic web framework succeeded in formalizing the semantics of VANET context domain and heightened the system abstraction level. Relevance of dispatched information to prospective recipients is enhanced by employing IR techniques and partial relevance. For commercial services, we used the hybrid vehicular communication (HVC) to increase the decentralized processing, exploit the vehicle processing power and increase user satisfaction and privacy. V2V is used for safety and convenience services where the level of abstraction has increased by using high level situation context attributes. In addition, more precise application notifications are now feasible after improving reasoning about situation certainty and severity. Hence, the main novelty of VANET IR-CAS is that it provides a highly abstract hybrid context model with IR based processing that raises the notification relevance, certainty and precision beside increasing decentralization and user satisfaction.},

In both approaches, misuse case threats were coupled with attack trees to give more insight on the attack techniques and how to mitigate them through security use cases. Seven professional software developers from two European software companies took part in the experiment. Participants were able to identify threats and mitigations they would not have identified otherwise. They also reported that both approaches were easy to learn, seemed to improve productivity and that using them were likely to improve their own skills and confidence in the results.},

abstract = {In globally distributed software projects the testing expertise may be scattered across multiple locations. We describe and discuss a globally distributed agile project at DNV GL Software, a multinational provider of software for a safer, smarter and greener future in the energy, process and maritime industries. DNV GL Software is headquartered in Norway. The project is distributed across two locations with 12 team members in Norway and three testers in China. In a distributed agile team with little overlap in working hours the challenge is to coordinate tasks and test activities in a way that makes coordination and communication efficient. DNV GL Software believes in including the remote testers as part of the agile team, enabling self-managing, cross-functional virtual teams that are capable of taking the full responsibility for implementing and verifying one entire feature. To support the communication between testers in China and the rest of the team in Norway, the team needs a shared understanding of the goal of a release and how to collaborate. We conducted interviews with the team and representatives from different roles in the organization, and we performed retrospectives with the team. In this article we describe how continuous testing based on continuous and frequent feedback ensures knowledge sharing and safeguarding the quality of the system under development. We found the following enablers for a successful virtual agile team: coordination by mutual adjustment, dedicated testers and low turnover, shifting working hours, and self-management and autonomy. Non-technical factors, such as socio-technical and organizational factors, have a significant influence on the way software testing is performed in an agile virtual team. To be successful the organization needs to invest in bringing the remote testers closer to the rest of the team, as part of the virtual team.},

abstract = {The modern organizations are facing problems which have caused them to lose personnel. Losing people, the organizations lose knowledge. One of the solutions is to collaborate and share knowledge across time and distance. Knowledge sharing in communities has attracted attention in fields like knowledge management or sociology, in both research and practice. Inter-organizational forms of network organizations are more and more accentuated. The paper focuses on the communities of practice within organizations and how through these communities collective intelligence is stimulated. First, we present the concept of communities of practice and show how multi-agent systems can simulate the behavior of complex systems composed of distinct components. Then we highlight the importance of collective intelligence in communities of practice and suggest a way to model communities of practice's dynamics. The main objective of the paper is to simulate collective intelligence capacity using agent-based models, and more specifically, the team of knowledge workers formation.},

abstract = {What makes a good question recommendation system for community question-answering sites? First, to maintain the health of the ecosystem, it needs to be designed around answerers, rather than exclusively for askers. Next, it needs to scale to many questions and users, and be fast enough to route a newly-posted question to potential answerers within the few minutes before the asker's patience runs out. It also needs to show each answerer questions that are relevant to his or her interests. We have designed and built such a system for Yahoo! Answers, but realized, when testing it with live users, that it was not enough.We found that those drawing-board requirements fail to capture user's interests. The feature that they really missed was diversity. In other words, showing them just the main topics they had previously expressed interest in was simply too dull. Adding the spice of topics slightly outside the core of their past activities significantly improved engagement. We conducted a large-scale online experiment in production in Yahoo! Answers that showed that recommendations driven by relevance alone perform worse than a control group without question recommendations, which is the current behavior. However, an algorithm promoting both diversity and freshness improved the number of answers by 17\%, daily session length by 10\%, and had a significant positive impact on peripheral activities such as voting.},

So, in this paper we define ontology, including concepts of contextual elements and the relationships among contextual elements in the port supply chain, and propose an ontology-based semantic representational approach to context awareness in the port supply chain. Also, we present cases of business processes in the port supply chain that incorporate context awareness.},

Drawing from our research on citizen relationship management (CiRM) and literature on absorptive capacity (ACAP), we argue that this setting increases an organization's ability to acquire, assimilate, transform, and exploit information and knowledge regarding the citizen's needs.

Such services enable users to ask and answer questions and to access existing question-answer pairs. CQA archives contain very large volumes of valuable user-generated content and have become important information resources on the Web. To make the body of knowledge accumulated in CQA archives accessible, effective and efficient question search is required. Question search in a CQA archive aims to retrieve historical questions that are relevant to new questions posed by users. This paper proposes a category-based framework for search in CQA archives. The framework embodies several new techniques that use language models to exploit categories of questions for improving question-answer search. Experiments conducted on real data from Yahoo!

abstract = {With the rapid development of online Knowledge Sharing Communities (KSCs), the problem of finding experts becomes increasingly important for knowledge propagation and putting crowd wisdom to work. A recent development trend of KSCs is to allow users to add text tags for annotating their posts, which are more accurate than traditional category information. However, how to leverage these user-generated tags for finding experts is still under-explored. To this end, in this paper, we develop a novel approach for finding experts in tag based KSCs by leveraging tag context and the semantic relationship between tags. Specifically, the extracted prior knowledge and user profiles are first used for enriching the query tags to infer tag context, which represents the user's latent information needs. Then, a topic model based approach is applied for capturing the semantic relationship between tags and then taking advantage of them for ranking user authority. We evaluate the proposed framework for expert finding on a large-scale real-world data set collected from a tag based Chinese commercial Q&amp;A web site. Experimental results clearly show that the proposed method outperforms several baseline methods with a significant margin.},

abstract = {In the more dynamic environments emerging from ad hoc and peer-to-peer networks, our research has explored the extent to which Web-based knowledge sharing as well as community formation require automation to understand human-readable content in a more distributed manner. RDFa is a syntactic format which can leverage this issue by allowing machine-readable data to be easily integrated into XHTML Web pages. Although there is a growing number of tools and techniques for generating and distilling RDFa, comparatively little work has been carried out on publishing existing RDF data sets as an XHTML+RDFa serialization. This paper proposes a generic approach to integrating RDF data into Web pages using the concept of automatically discovered "topic nodes". RDFa² is a proof-of-concept implementation of this approach and provides an on-line service assisting users in generating and personalizing pages with RDFa. We provide experimental results that support the viability of our approach to generating Web documents such as FOAF-based online profiles as well as RDF vocabularies with little user intervention.},

We found that task structure and knowledge practices facilitate only solicited sharing behaviors, but not voluntary sharing behaviors. In addition, the results indicate that feeling of solidarity and knowledge tools are significantly related to voluntary sharing behaviors.

The “global knowledge grid” is as an infrastructure that is suitable for implementing knowledge cluster systems on the basis of the three-site model. The knowledge cluster systems build an evolving network of community knowledge by connecting heterogeneous knowledge bases.

However, this article utilizes cost-profit analysis to find out opposite factors which will affect knowledge spillover of FDI. It reaches a conclusion that cooperation, not completely competition, has more important effect on knowledge spillover among corporations. Cooperation in knowledge innovation and to share innovation is beneficial for the rise of technology and production in foreign corporations and domestic corporations. Meanwhile, technology gap and absorbing ability of corporations will also affect knowledge spillover through affecting production and technology cooperation. So intellectual property is important to every corporation in the course of knowledge innovation cooperation. We should take measures of government support policy on knowledge innovation cooperation and make corporations self-constraint to encourage cooperation in knowledge sharing and knowledge spillover.},

abstract = {Software developers are used to seeking information from authoritative texts, such as a technical manuals, or from experts with whom they are familiar. Increasingly, developers seek information in online question and answer forums, where the quality of the information is variable. To a novice, it may be challenging to filter good information from bad. Stack Overflow is a Q&amp;A forum that introduces a social reputation element: users rate the quality of post-ed answers, and answerers can accrue points and rewards for writing answers that are rated highly by their peers. A user that consistently authors good answers will develop a good ‘reputation’ as recorded by these points. While this system was designed with the intent to incentivize high-quality answers, it has been suggested that information seekers—and particularly technical novices—may rely on the social reputation of the answerer as a proxy for answer quality. In this paper, we investigate the role that this social factor—as well as other answer characteristics—plays in the information filtering process of technical novices in the context of Stack Over-flow. The results of our survey conducted on Amazon.com’s Mechanical Turk indicate that technical novices assess information quality based on the intrinsic qualities of the answer, such as presentation and content, suggesting that novices are wary to rely on social cues in the Q&amp;A context.},

In this paper, a basic architecture of an agent system is proposed to support the exchange and sharing of design information by means of ACL (Agent Communication Language) in preliminary ship design. Above all, the conflicts that occur in the middle of knowledge sharing in the system must be resolved. One approach is to adopt a case-based conflict resolution strategy formulated to resolve current conflict on the basis of previous resolved similar cases in agent-based collaborative design system environments. In addition, conflict resolution handler located in the facilitator which is an agent to control other sub-agents, is developed to treat conflict problems effectively.},

The problem of document annotation is addressed in the literature under two broad classes of techniques namely, key phrase extraction and key phrase abstraction. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to generate summary phrases for research documents. Given the dynamic nature of scientific research, it has become important to incorporate new and popular scientific terminologies in document annotations. For this purpose, we have used crowd-source knowledge bases like Wikipedia and WikiCFP (a open source information source for call for papers) for automating key phrase generation. Also, we have taken into account the lack of availability of the document's content (due to protective policies) and developed a global context based key-phrase identification approach. We show that given only the title of a document, the proposed approach generates its global context information using academic search engines like Google Scholar. We evaluated the performance of the proposed approach on real-world dataset obtained from a computer science research document corpus. We quantitatively evaluated the performance of the proposed approach and compared it with two baseline approaches.},

Yet, relatively little is known about the socio-technical dimensions of genealogists' interactions in such forums. This study examined exchanges between genealogists on a popular Q&amp;A message board on Ancestry.com. Our findings suggest that the web context shapes the types of exchanges and cooperative activities in which genealogists engage. Research has found that in face-to-face exchanges genealogists tend to help other genealogists by providing instructional guidance both on a one-to-one and a many-to-one basis. Our findings suggest that the presence of online genealogical data and the affordances of interactive computer technologies may be pushing answerers away from providing instruction on how to find family history data and pushing them toward providing those data outright. Answerers worked cooperatively to provide family data, suggesting that the web context is leading many genealogists to engage in cooperative research not collaborative instruction.},

abstract = {We describe Quizz, a gamified crowdsourcing system that simultaneously assesses the knowledge of users and acquires new knowledge from them. Quizz operates by asking users to complete short quizzes on specific topics; as a user answers the quiz questions, Quizz estimates the user's competence. To acquire new knowledge, Quizz also incorporates questions for which we do not have a known answer; the answers given by competent users provide useful signals for selecting the correct answers for these questions. Quizz actively tries to identify knowledgeable users on the Internet by running advertising campaigns, effectively leveraging the targeting capabilities of existing, publicly available, ad placement services. Quizz quantifies the contributions of the users using information theory and sends feedback to the advertisingsystem about each user. The feedback allows the ad targeting mechanism to further optimize ad placement.Our experiments, which involve over ten thousand users, confirm that we can crowdsource knowledge curation for niche and specialized topics, as the advertising network can automatically identify users with the desired expertise and interest in the given topic. We present controlled experiments that examine the effect of various incentive mechanisms, highlighting the need for having short-term rewards as goals, which incentivize the users to contribute. Finally, our cost-quality analysis indicates that the cost of our approach is below that of hiring workers through paid-crowdsourcing platforms, while offering the additional advantage of giving access to billions of potential users all over the planet, and being able to reach users with specialized expertise that is not typically available through existing labor marketplaces.},

It is not easy to transfer experimental know-how and experimental findings. Based on our experience, this paper discusses this problem and proposes a Framework for Improving the Replication of Experiments (FIRE). The FIRE addresses knowledge sharing issues both at the intra-group (internal replications) and inter-group (external replications) levels. It encourages coordination of replications in order to facilitate knowledge transfer for lower cost, higher quality replications and more generalizable results.},

In SO, developers post questions related to a programming topic and other members of the site can provide answers to help them. The information available on this type of service is also known as "crowd knowledge" and currently is one important trend in supporting activities related to software development and maintenance.  We present an approach that makes use of "crowd knowledge" available in SO to recommend information that can assist developers in their activities. This strategy recommends a ranked list of pairs of questions/answers from SO based on a query (list of terms). The ranking criteria is based on two main aspects: the textual similarity of the pairs with respect to the query (the developer's problem) and the quality of the pairs. Moreover, we developed a classifier to consider only "how-to" posts. We conducted an experiment considering programming problems on three different topics (Swing, Boost and LINQ) widely used by the software development community to evaluate the proposed recommendation strategy. The results have shown that for 77.14\% of the assessed activities, at least one recommended pair proved to be useful concerning the target programming problem. Moreover, for all activities, at least one recommended pair had a source code snippet considered reproducible or almost reproducible.},

abstract = {Ontologies are significant for the development of the semantic web, which could implement the information reusing and knowledge sharing. With the number of ontologies increasing rapidly, ontology mapping is a useful method to clear up the heterogeneity among ontologies so that ontologies could understand each other properly. Structures information is important for mining semantic relation during ontology mapping. In the ontology hierarchy, vertical information is the main factor used in many mapping methods, while the horizontal relation is not employed fully yet. In this paper, from the aspect of the dimensions of the concept in ontologies, which describes the horizontal relation of ontology concepts, an ontology mapping approach is proposed. The values on concept dimensions could be named concepts, intersections, unions, complements or restrictions. They are compared with ontology concepts to help ontology mapping. Experiments indicate that the concept dimension is an important factor infecting ontology mapping.},

Several attempts have been made to mine the data in distributed environment however, maintaining the privacy while mining the data over cloud is a challenging task. In this paper, we present an efficient and practical cryptographic based scheme that preserves privacy and mine the cloud data which is distributed in nature. In order to address the classification task, our approach uses k-NN classifier. We extend the Jaccard measure to find the similarity between two encrypted and distributed records by conducting an equality test. In addition, our approach accelerates mining by finding nearest neighbours at local and then at global level. The proposed approach avoids transmitting the original data and sharing of the key that is required in traditional crypto based privacy preserving data mining solutions.},

abstract = {Timely information access and effective knowledge support is crucial to law enforcement officers' crime fighting and investigations. An expanding array of e-government initiatives target the development of advanced information technologies and their deployment in law enforcement agencies. Abase in point is COPLINK, an integrated system that provides law enforcement officers with timely data access, effective information support, integrated knowledge sharing, and improved collaboration within or beyond the agency boundaries. In this study, we examine law enforcement officers' acceptance of COPLONK Mobile by proposing and testing a factor model premised in established theoretical foundations. According to our results, the model is capable of explaining or predicting officers' intentions to use the technology. Our survey data support the proposed model and the hypotheses it suggests. Among the acceptance determinants we investigated, perceived usefulness appears to have the most significant influence on individual officers' intention to use COPLONK Mobile.},

Specifically in the teaching \&amp; learning environment, we are witnessing that the traditional model of presence based magisterial classes is shifting towards Web Based Learning. This new model draws on remote access systems, knowledge sharing, and student mobility. In this context, pedagogical strategies are also changing, and for instance, Project- Based Learning (PBL) is seen as a potential driver for growth and development in this arena. This study is focused on a PBL oriented course with a Distributed Remote ACcess (DRAC) system. The objective is to analyze how quantitative methods can be leveraged to design and evaluate automatic diagnosis and feedback tools to assist students on quality-related pedagogical issues in DRAC enabled PBL courses. Main conclusions derived from this study are correlation-based and reveal that the development of automatic quality assessment and feedback requires further research.},

With the number of ontologies increasing rapidly, ontology mapping is a useful method to clear up the heterogeneity among ontologies so that ontologies could understand each other properly. Structures information is important for mining semantic relation during ontology mapping. In the ontology hierarchy, vertical information is the main factor used in many mapping methods, while the horizontal relation is not employed fully yet. In this paper, from the aspect of the dimensions of the concept in ontologies, which describes the horizontal relation of ontology concepts, an ontology mapping approach is proposed. The values on concept dimensions could be named concepts, intersections, unions, complements or restrictions. They are compared with ontology concepts to help ontology mapping. Experiments indicate that the concept dimension is an important factor infecting ontology mapping.},

In order to discover what architectural knowledge needs architects have, we conducted a study in a large organization. In this study we discovered that architects are especially in need for `Just-In-Time architectural knowledge'. To fulfill this need we designed and implemented an architectural knowledge sharing portal. Our portal's integrated functionality supports architects in their decision-making process, by providing easy access to the right architectural knowledge at any given point in time.},

Efficient ways of sharing and managing knowledge is imperative for the effectiveness of e-government initiatives in any country. Thus, e-government and knowledge management initiatives should not be managed separately. This paper, based on an interpretative research approach discusses the theoretical and practical aspects of knowledge management and e-government initiatives in the context of developing countries. For the purpose of analysis, online research papers and reports were investigated and Bangladesh was considered as representative of a typical developing country. The case for Bangladesh shows that while the government can easily present online a number of its services, these may not be effective for the targeted users as those services have failed to address some critical implementation factors. Furthermore, the paper discusses critical factors for e-government initiatives that are important for policy makers to enable them efficiently participate in the knowledge sharing process using the appropriate methods and technologies.},

Hence, efficient knowledge management counts amongst the most important challenges for software teams. In international teams, one of the most important issues regarding knowledge sharing is the impact of culture under different aspects: national, organizational and professional. There seem to be very few studies dealing with the issue of culture in regard to knowledge management practices in GSE. We want to contribute to the discussion by presenting case studies of small size software teams dealing with international software development in the context of offshoring. In doing so, we illustrate how cultural and social issues influence the way knowledge exchange is performed by analyzing several knowledge management practices, considering the role of meetings, artifacts and tools, knowledge brokers and mutual visits between sites.},

abstract = {Recently, query suggestions have become quite useful in web searches. Most provide additional and correct terms based on the initial query entered by users. However, query suggestions often recommend queries that differ from the user's search intentions due to different contexts. In such cases, faceted query expansions and their usages are quite efficient. In this paper, we propose faceted query expansion methods using the resources of Community Question Answering (CQA), which is social network service (SNS) that shares user knowledge. In a CQA site, users can post questions in a suitable category. Others answer them based on the category framework. Thus, the CQA "category" makes a "facet" of the query expansion. In addition, the time of year when the question was posted plays an important role in understanding its context. Thus, such seasonality creates another "facet" of the query expansion. We implement two-dimensional faceted query expansion methods based on the results of the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) analysis of CQA resources. The question articles deriving query expansion are provided for choosing appropriate terms by users. Our sophisticated evaluations using actual and long-term CQA resources, such as "Yahoo! CHIEBUKURO," demonstrate that most parts of the CQA questions are posted in periodicity and in bursts.},

However, the problem of locating and matching appropriate knowledge resources from across organisational boundaries to various tasks within specific e-Work projects remains a huge challenge. This often stems from lack of collective trust among virtual teams and the high value which organisations attach to knowledge as an asset of competitive advantage. In this paper, we present an approach for task-centred knowledge sharing in e-Collaboration. Our approach uses task-aware knowledge element models for locating and matching knowledge resources for specific e-Work tasks, and a work context tree for contextually determining the semantics of knowledge resources at different levels. We illustrate the approach using e-Workbench – a prototype adaptive collaborative e-Work support system based on the Knowledge Grid.},

Through an ethnographic study of a U.S. based teaching hospital it was found that doctors and nurses organize a hodgepodge of information systems, some electronic, other paper-based or wall mounted into circular patterns. The data allows a description of how these cyclical organized systems oscillate between documents that address a broader and narrower configuration of participants, times, places and content. In doing so, organizational members continuously adjust their system use to meet the level of background knowledge held by their collaborators, that is, how intimately their collaborators know the context and the routine work practices at hand. The cyclical organization of information systems does not prevent breakdowns in knowledge sharing. To avert such problems each cycle starts and ends with a dialog and reflection among collaborators.},

abstract = {The highest level of mathematics has traditionally been seen as a solitary endeavour, to produce a proof for review and acceptance by research peers. Mathematics is now at a remarkable inflexion point, with new technology radically extending the power and limits of individuals. Crowdsourcing pulls together diverse experts to solve problems; symbolic computation tackles huge routine calculations; and computers check proofs too long and complicated for humans to comprehend.The Study of Mathematical Practice is an emerging interdisciplinary field which draws on philosophy and social science to understand how mathematics is produced. Online mathematical activity provides a novel and rich source of data for empirical investigation of mathematical practice - for example the community question-answering system mathoverflow contains around 40,000 mathematical conversations, and polymath collaborations provide transcripts of the process of discovering proofs. Our preliminary investigations have demonstrated the importance of "soft" aspects such as analogy and creativity, alongside deduction and proof, in the production of mathematics, and have given us new ways to think about the roles of people and machines in creating new mathematical knowledge. We discuss further investigation of these resources and what it might reveal.Crowdsourced mathematical activity is an example of a "social machine", a new paradigm, identified by Berners-Lee, for viewing a combination of people and computers as a single problem-solving entity, and the subject of major international research endeavours. We outline a future research agenda for mathematics social machines, a combination of people, computers, and mathematical archives to create and apply mathematics, with the potential to change the way people do mathematics, and to transform the reach, pace, and impact of mathematics research.},

Automated learning and online knowledge sharing are employed among the participating nodes, while the distillation of the network traffic is performed by each individual each node. This approach for local analysis of the network traffic gives the opportunity for utilization of simple automated learners at each node and the reduction of the amount of information exchanged among the peers.},

The questions with the most votes are then recommended and ranked on the top when users browse questions by category. As users are not obligated to rate questions, usually only a small proportion of questions eventually gets rating. Thus, in this paper, we are concerned with learning to recommend questions from user ratings of a limited size. To overcome the data sparsity, we propose to utilize questions without users rating as well. Further, as there exist certain noises within user ratings (the preference of some users expressed in their ratings diverges from that of the majority of users), we design a new algorithm called 'majority-based perceptron algorithm' which can avoid the influence of noisy instances by emphasizing its learning over data instances from the majority users. Experimental results from a large collection of real questions confirm the effectiveness of our proposals.},

The importance of ontologies has been recognised within the biomedical domain and work has begun on developing and sharing biomedical ontologies. In this paper, we define ontology and ontology commitments and explain the main characteristics and representations of ontology models. Ontologies are highly expressive knowledge models and as such increase expressiveness and intelligence of a system. We highlight the significance of ontologies in a variety of semi-automatic and automatic tasks, and provide an illustrative example of an ontology-based multi-agent system designed to intelligently retrieve information about human diseases from a number of heterogeneous and dispersed information resources.},

abstract = {Debugging compiler errors is essential to programming and can be challenging for novice programmers. In introductory computer science courses, challenging errors can discourage students. One reason these errors are difficult to resolve is that most online help systems do not match a student's code. For example, online reference pages use different variable names, identifiers, and method names compared with a student's particular code. To utilize existing resources, students must wade through other people's code (which is often too advanced for novices to comprehend). This is time-consuming and does not provide novices with solutions.To address this problem, we developed MatchingRef -a reference system that helps novices resolve compiler errors. It is a web-based reference guide that catalogs common Processing/Java compiler errors. MatchingRef integrates with the Processing programming environment to provide users with explanations and that match users' particular code. It includes a list of strategies to fix each error, accompanied by one or more concrete examples. Importantly, the key feature that distinguishes MatchingRef from prior reference systems (e.g., Decaf [1], HelpMeOut [4], CodeWrite [2]) is that MatchingRef examples are all dynamically generated using variable, method, and class names from users' programming environments.There are four guiding design principles behind MatchingRef. First is readability, which is listed as a criterion that good error messages should exhibit [5]. The description from Java documentation is usually technical and causes confusion for novice programmers. Hence, we provide explanations that are less cryptic and more familiar in wording. Second is learning by examples. Examples have been shown to be effective way to learn and fix programming errors, such as in online forum like Stack Overflow [7]. Therefore, we include examples in each suggestion so that users can have a concrete idea on how to fix the problems. Third is familiarity, a common design principle across domains [3]. MatchingRef matches elements in the fixing examples with the original code of the users. Finally, our system is intended to reduce cognitive load by customizing the pages to users' code to show the relevant information. According to Cognitive Load Theory (CLT), humans have a finite ability to efficiently process input [6]. As MatchingRef provide users with matching error messages and matching names, their brain only needs to process useful information such as ways to fix the errors or roots of the errors. Users can avoid reading some information in the page multiple times such as variable names or class names because they are already familiar with them.We conducted a within-subjects pilot study (n = 4) to evaluate whether MatchingRef improved novices' performance and comprehension while debugging compiler errors. Participants interacted with two designs of our system, one with matching variable names in the examples and one without this feature. Otherwise, the systems were identical. The participants were students in introductory computer science courses that use Processing. Due to the small sample size, we could not detect significant differences in task completion time. Although the conclusions we can draw are limited, we are encouraged to evaluate MatchingRef in a more formal study.},

Knowledge sharing mechanisms become especially important in a large organization which operates in multiple locations. These call for infrastructures, rules and procedures.

In this paper we present a formalisation of the problem based upon a specific game, the English Auction, that results independent of the number of involved agents and of the negotiation subject. In our framework, each agent's viewpoint is denoted by a logical theory. We show that the problem as posed in the framework is decidable, under a very general assumption and that the computational complexity of the algorithm is polynomial in the number of agents and in the number of preferred representations of the agents.},

P2PKM can be seen as a natural extension of practicing KM from an individual level to sharing knowledge with a group of peers. In this paper, the author proposed a P2PKM framework, the framework is comprised of three components: P2P knowledge sharing, P2P knowledge exchange and P2P collaboration. The framework will help us understand P2PKM better. We can also use the framework to develop some valuable KM systems.},

An overall framework of a context agent is established, which consists of behavior interpreter, ontology context repository, inference engine, contexture behavior sequence planner and evaluation repository. We formalize behaviors of context entity and services, and take them into consideration in behavior-planning based service composition. An ontology model of context environment is built to describe context semantic in order to enable knowledge sharing. The predictability and controllability of context entities are addressed and corresponding evaluation mechanism and planning algorithm are proposed. Dynamic Description Logic is applied in contextual behavior sequence decision, and its satiability-checking algorithm is extended to enhance the constraining power of pre-conditions in a contextual behavior.},

Although the topic is the same, arguably the two users in each case will satisfy their information needs with very different texts. Yet today search engines mostly adopt the one-size-fits-all solution, where personalization is restricted to topical preference. We found that users do not uniformly prefer simple texts, and that the text comprehensibility level should match the user's level of preparedness. Consequently, we propose to model the comprehensibility of texts as well as the users' reading proficiency in order to better explain how different users choose content for further exploration. We also model topic-specific reading proficiency, which allows us to better explain why a physician might choose to read sophisticated medical articles yet simple descriptions of SLR cameras. We explore different ways to build user profiles, and use collaborative filtering techniques to overcome data sparsity. We conducted experiments on large-scale datasets from a major Web search engine and a community question answering forum. Our findings confirm that explicitly modeling text comprehensibility can significantly improve content ranking (search results or answers, respectively).},

This omission prevents OWL from being a satisfactory ontology language for automated semantic annotation. We can resolve this problem by adding to ontological OWL declarations epistemological instance recognition semantics that include external representations and context recognition information for atomic, lexical ontology concepts. Our implementation shows that the new automated annotation prototype system using OWL ontologies with rich instance-recognition semantics not only has high precision and recall, but also overcomes the post-processing problem of linking extracted data to semantic-web ontologies. Our study also shows that the use of instance recognition semantics in ontologies can lead to enhanced knowledge sharing and reuse through the Semantic Web.},

abstract = {Community Question Answering (CQA) has emerged as a popular forum for users to ask and answer questions. Over the last few years, CQA portals such as Yahoo answersand Baidu Zhidao have exploded in popularity, and now provide a viable alternative to general purpose Web search. A number of answers submitted to address questions on CQA sites compose a valuable knowledge repository, which could be a gold mine for information retrieval as well as text mining. Two important questions in CQA research are focused on the quality of contents and the reputation of the answerers. Previous approaches for retrieving relevant and high quality content have been proposed, but not much work has been done on providing an integrated framework to solve these two problems. Besides, no research work has used both text and link information in their methods via leveraging existing ratings of answers and questions. In this paper, we present a novel approach to analyze questions and answers based on the topic modeling framework with Dirichlet forest priors (LDA-DF)[8]. We utilize information obtained from LDA-DF to construct a joint topical and link model to identify authorities and reliable answers on a CQA site.We evaluate our methods in a dataset obtained from Yahoo!

abstract = {The present Indian Technical Education needs to adopt to the rapidly changing technological changes and bridge the gap between academics and Industry needs. With the ever changing expectations of the learner, we need to adapt to the technology to a larger extent to share knowledge. Knowledge sharing using technology is the need of the hour today. Institutes will have the best resources with lot of skills and experience. This resulting knowledge has to be stored and managed effectively resulting in a vast knowledge bank. Retrieving the tacit knowledge of the teachers of the Institute will always be a big challenge. Knowledge, being the most important resource needs to be managed effectively. Knowledge Management not only retrieves and stores the existing knowledge but also supports the growth of new knowledge. Most educational institutions have some type of Information systems in place to store knowledge, but there is lot of barriers that makes the sharing of knowledge difficult. There should be a proper framework to store assimilate and share knowledge in an institution. To cater to the knowledge needs of the institution, a framework for the knowledge management is designed. This system is designed keeping in mind the requirements of an Indian Technical Institute. This system will be used for creating, assimilating, sharing and overall Knowledge Management of an Institution.},

abstract = {The traditional "publish-find-bind" architecture for web services paid little attention to the problem of communication and knowledge sharing between the service providers and the service consumers. This problem is very important because, in order to discover required services effectively and efficiently, the consumers need to know more about the published services. We should consider how customers represent their requirements and how service providers represent their services, and hence to bridge the knowledge gap between the service providers and the service consumers. This paper investigates the use of structured description and representation of natural language in the matchmaking of web-services with customer requirements. A semantic framework for the representation of such descriptions is motivated based upon the limitations of current approaches. A matchmaking algorithm is given along with a concrete example of how the matchmaking process may be applied.},

abstract = {Multi-task learning aims at learning multiple related but different tasks. In general, there are two ways for multi-task learning. One is to exploit the small set of labeled data from all tasks to learn a shared feature space for knowledge sharing. In this way, the focus is on the labeled training samples while the large amount of unlabeled data is not sufficiently considered. Another way has a focus on how to share model parameters among multiple tasks based on the original features space. Here, the question is whether it is possible to combine the advantages of both approaches and develop a method, which can simultaneously learn a shared subspace for multiple tasks and learn the prediction models in this subspace? To this end, in this paper, we propose a feature representation learning framework, which has the ability in combining the autoencoders, an effective way to learn good representation by using large amount of unlabeled data, and model parameter regularization methods into a unified model for multi-task learning. Specifically, all the tasks share the same encoding and decoding weights to find their latent feature representations, based on which a regularized multi-task softmax regression method is used to find a distinct prediction model for each task. Also, some commonalities are considered in the prediction models according to the relatedness of multiple tasks. There are several advantages of the proposed model: 1) it can make full use of large amount of unlabeled data from all the tasks to learn satisfying representations, 2) the learning of distinct prediction models can benefit from the success of autoencoder, 3) since we incorporate the labeled information into the softmax regression method, so the learning of feature representation is indeed in a semi-supervised manner. Therefore, our model is a semi-supervised autoencoder for multi-task learning (SAML for short). Finally, extensive experiments on three real-world data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. Moreover, the feature representation obtained in this model can be used by other methods to obtain improved results.},

abstract = {A distributed logical framework designed to serve as a declarative semantic foundation for Networked Cyber-Physical Systems provides notions of facts and goals that include interactions with the environment via external goal requests, observations that generate facts, and actions that achieve goals. Reasoning rules are built on a partially ordered knowledge-sharing model for loosely coupled distributed computing. The logic supports reasoning in the context of dynamically changing facts and system goals. It can be used both to program systems and to reason about possible scenarios and emerging properties.The underlying reasoning framework is specified in terms of constraints that must be satisfied, making it very general and flexible. Inference rules for an instantiation to a specific local logic (Horn clause logic) are given as a concrete example. The key novel features are illustrated with snippets from an existing application-a theory for self-organizing robots performing a distributed surveillance task. Traditional properties of logical inference and computation are reformulated in this novel context, and related to features of system design and execution. Proofs are outlined for key properties corresponding to soundness, completeness, and termination. Finally, the framework is compared to other formal systems addressing concurrent/distributed computation.},

abstract = {As online community question answering (cQA) portals like Yahoo! Answers1 and Baidu Zhidao2 have attracted over hundreds of millions of questions, how to utilize these questions and accordant answers becomes increasingly important for cQA websites. Prior approaches focus on using information retrieval techniques to provide a ranked list of questions based on their similarities to the query. Due to the high variance of question quality and answer quality, users have to spend lots of time on finding the truly best answers from retrieved results. In this paper, we develop an answer retrieval and summarization system which directly provides an accurate and comprehensive answer summary instead of a list of similar questions to user’s query. To fully explore the information of relations between queries and questions, between questions and answers, and between answers and sentences, we propose a new probabilistic scoring model to distinguish high-quality answers from low-quality answers. By fully exploiting these relations, we summarize answers using a maximum coverage model. Experiment results on the data extracted from Chinese cQA websites demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed method.},

The ontological knowledge management framework supports the tasks of adding a new ontological concept, updating and editing an existing ontological concept and querying ontological concepts to facilitate knowledge retrieval through conceptual clustering, cluster-based identification and concept-based query. The framework can be used to facilitate ontology reuse and ontological concept visualization and navigation in concept lattice form through the formal context space.},

Several case studies have been conducted showing positive influence on student's success. However, those case studies are based on the fact of introducing weblogs as an obligatory part of coursework for the students. The research presented sought to determine the influence of maintaining a weblog as a personal learning log and ePortfolio would positively influence the students' performance in a large programming course with the explicit precondition that blogging was voluntary and no necessary part of coursework.},

abstract = {In safety-critical embedded systems the stack typically is the only dynamically allocated memory area. However, the maximal stack usage must be statically known: at configuration time developers have to reserve enough stack space for each task. Stack overflow errors are often hard to find but can cause the system to crash or behave erroneously. All current safety standards, e.g., ISO-26262, require upper estimations of the storage space; due to its dynamic behavior the stack is an especially critical storage area.Typically neither testing and measuring nor static source code analysis can provide safe bounds on the worst-case stack usage. A safe upper bound can be computed by whole-program static analysis at the executable code level. When an Abstract Interpretation based static analyzer is used, it can be formally proven that the maximal stack usage will never be underestimated. The challenge for binary-code level analyzers is to minimize the necessary amount of user interactions, e.g., for function pointer calls. To minimize user interaction, the analysis has to be precise, and the annotation mechanism has to be flexible and easy-to-use. The analyzer configuration has to be done once for each software project; afterwards the analysis can be run automatically, supporting continuous verification.In this article we describe the principles of Abstract Interpretation based stack analysis. We present an annotation language addressing all properties of typical automotive and avionics software and report on practical experience.},

abstract = {The Web and, in particular, knowledge-sharing communities such as Wikipedia contain a huge amount of information encompassing disparate and diverse fields. Knowledge bases such as DBpedia or Yago represent the data in a concise and more structured way bearing the potential of bringing database tools to Web Search. The wealth of data, however, poses the challenge of how to retrieve important and valuable information, which is often intertwined with trivial and less important details. This calls for an efficient and automatic summarization method.In this demonstration proposal, we consider the novel problem of summarizing the information related to a given entity, like a person or an organization. To this end, we utilize the rich type graph that knowledge bases provide for each entity, and define the problem of selecting the best cost-restricted subset of types as summary with good coverage of salient properties.We propose a demonstration of our system which allows the user to specify the entity to summarize, an upper bound on the cost of the resulting summary, as well as to browse the knowledge base in a more simple and intuitive manner.},

Hive is a conference-centric, but cross-conference platform, where researchers can seed and expand their research networks, keep track of the technical research sessions they are attending, meet new colleagues, share their ideas, ask questions, give and receive comments, or simply keep and/or view records of interactions at a conference they have attended (or wanted to attend, but missed due to other commitments). In its core, Hive leverages dynamically evolving knowledge structures, including user connections, concept maps, co-authorship networks, content from papers and presentations, and contextual knowledge to create and to promote networks of peers. These peer networks support each other explicitly through direct communication or indirectly through collaborative filtering. Hive provides the following online integrated services: a) understanding the personal activity context through access patterns and analysis of user supplied content, b) context-aware resource discovery, including search, presentation, and exploration support within the scientific knowledge structures, and c) peer discovery, and peer driven resource and knowledge sharing and collaborative recommendations.},

It exploits the technological flexibility of software applications to enable these actors to change usages and configurations. Taking the case of the BSCWeasel groupware, we demonstrate how an appropriation infrastructure can be realized. Empirical results from the BSCWeasel project demonstrate the impact of such an infrastructure on the appropriation and design process.

This study is based on an electronic survey with more than 200 systems administrators, or sysadmins, working on incident management in a large scale IT service delivery organization. The survey covered their information needs in both complex and routine situations. The results of the survey described in this paper go beyond previous work on system administrators by presenting a much more complex picture, suggesting that sysadmins make low usage of knowledge management tools; largely adopt personal communication and collaboration tools: and finally, need to gather information about customers from a complex set of stakeholders. The system administrators also indicated in our survey that the most useful sources of information in handling complex incidents are: (i) the customer; (ii) the customer account team; and (iii) other employees who were experts both in the customer and in particular aspects of the delivery of services. This study indicates that knowledge management in IT service factories is very challenging and possibly should evolve from the often adopted passive model to a dynamic knowledge management style emphasizing both knowledge reusability through information technologies and knowledge sharing through informal discussions among employees.},

For instance, a developer performing a task using the android.app.Activity class could consult various project resources including the class's source file, API documentation, issue tracker, mailing list discussions, code reviews, or questions on Stack Overflow.  These information sources are logically connected by the source code elements they describe, but are generally decoupled from each other. This has historically been tolerated by developers, since there was no obvious way to easily navigate between the data sources. However, it is now common for these sources to have web-based front ends that provide a standard mechanism (the browser) for viewing and interacting with the data they contain. Augmenting these front ends with hyperlinks and search would make development easier by allowing developers to quickly navigate between disparate sources of information about the same code element.  In this paper, we propose a method of automatically linking disparate information repositories with an emphasis on high precision. We also propose a method of augmenting web-based front ends with these links to make it easier for developers to quickly gain a comprehensive view of the source code elements they are investigating. Research challenges include identifying source code tokens in the midst of natural language text and incomplete code fragments, dynamically augmenting the web views of the data repositories, and supporting novel composition of the link data to provide comprehensive views for specific source code elements.},

Yet these are crucial in distributed and collaborative worlds such as the Semantic Web, where ontologies and their communities of use naturally and mutually co-evolve. Through a deep understanding of the real-time, community-driven, evolution of so-called ontologies, a semantic agent system can be made operationally relevant and sustainable over long periods of time. Such a paradigm shift in knowledge-intensive and community-driven systems would affect knowledge sharing and communication across diverse communities in business, industry, and society. In this paper, we give an overview of the practical and theoretical challenges and limitations, and based on that introduce an ontological and methodological foundation for community evolution processes.},

abstract = {Severe memory constraint of wireless sensor networks (WSN) causes lots of problems such as irrecoverable stack overflow and out-of-memory failure. These problems motivated to develop efficient memory management schemes for WSNs. A shared-stack is the memory-efficient thread stack, designed for memory-constrained environments such as WSNs. However, stack switching of shared-stacks makes external memory fragmentation, which induces memory space overhead, or CPU overhead to eliminate it. In this paper, we propose a novel stack buffer management scheme for shared-stacks, called linked stack buffer management. It manages context of threads as multiple linked stack buffers. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme alleviates external fragmentation of shared-stacks efficiently.},

Digital library systems generally require integration with minimal or no changes to their code. IntegraL users see a totally integrated environment. They use their digital library system just as before. They also see extra link anchors. Selecting one generates a list of links to relevant meta-information (structural, content-based and knowledge-sharing relationships, and metadata). IntegraL generates the vast majority of supplemental link anchors and meta-information links automatically through the use of relationship rules. This paper presents the concept of meta-information, describes the IntegraL infrastructure and architecture supported by single sign-on authentication middleware, and explains how systems can integrate into the infrastructure. This research’s primary contribution is providing a relatively straightforward, sustainable infrastructure for integrating digital library collections and services.},

Doing so has required innovative thinking about the roles of the students, faculty, and project sponsors. In this paper, we discuss issues with scaling up the components that have made this program successful. These include housing the courses in an NSF IUCRC that enable the cultivation of highly-committed industry partners, the creation of strong pre-requisite courses, careful development of faculty resources through the selective hiring and mentoring of clinical faculty, a commitment of the faculty to give up close management and control, strong partnerships with other organizations within the university to provide students greater access to resources, an emphasis on cross-team knowledge sharing and learning, and the development of unique assessment and evaluation tools so as to be able to monitor, measure and fairly assess a wide-spectrum of projects.},

Proponent's arguments explain one's thoughts or beliefs to the opponent. The knowledge shared by the proponent may be invalid or inconsistent with respect to the opponent's common sense knowledge. Therefore, the opponent reverts rationally through a counter- argument. The proponent then removes the contradictions and proposes subsequent argument to the opponent. This exchange of propositions or arguments continues until the participant(s) is convinced about the shared knowledge. The validity of the shared knowledge shall be evaluated by measuring the components of the participants' knowledge base.},

While the proposed system, called SemWIQ (Semantic Web Integrator and Query Engine) is primarily designed for sharing data for scientific collaboration, it is regarded as a base technology useful for many other Semantic Web applications which use ontologies to describe highly-structured data.At its core, SemWIQ is based on the mediator-wrapper architecture and a specialized SPARQL query processor which is able to virtually integrate data using declarative queries (Note: SPARQL is a standardized declarative query language for the Semantic Web). Combined with latest research towards new graphical user interfaces for the Web of Data, the proposed approach is very well suited for large-scale collaborative knowledge sharing in research as well as in the industry.},

To overcome this limitation, we present HARE, a novel hybrid query processing engine that brings together machine and human computation to execute SPARQL queries. We propose a model that exploits the characteristics of RDF in order to estimate the completeness of portions of a data set. The completeness model complemented by crowd knowledge is used by the HARE query engine to on-the-fly decide which parts of a query should be executed against the data set or via crowd computing. To evaluate HARE, we created and executed a collection of 50 SPARQL queries against the DBpedia data set. Experimental results clearly show that our solution accurately enhances answer completeness.},

Each buyer agent independently models a seller after having purchased goods from the seller and, upon request, shares this knowledge with friends. We investigated if having a larger number of friends enables buyers to find good quality low priced sellers in the market more rapidly and also if there is a point of diminishing returns, beyond which increasing the number of friends will not have any positive effects. Our results show that, by sharing information with friends, the buyers are able to identify good sellers earlier. However the marginal gain of having more friends decreases as the number of friends increases.},

abstract = {Context: In large-scale distributed software projects the expertise may be scattered across multiple locations.Goal: We describe and discuss a large-scale distributed agile project at Ericsson, a multinational telecommunications company headquartered in Sweden. The project is distributed across four development locations (one in Sweden, one in Korea and two in China) and employs 17 teams. In such a large scale environment the challenge is to have as few dependences between teams as possible, which is one reason why Ericsson introduced cross-functional feature teams -- teams that are capable of taking the full responsibility for implementing one entire feature. To support such teams when solving problems, ensure knowledge sharing within the project and safeguard the quality Ericsson introduced a new role -- Technical Area Responsible (TAR).Method: We conducted extensive fieldwork for 9 months at two Ericsson sites in Sweden and China. We interviewed representatives from different roles in the organization, in addition to focus groups and a survey with seven teams.Results: We describe the TAR role, and how the TARs communicate, coordinate and support the teams. Also architects support the teams, however not as closely as the TARs. We found that the TAR is usually a senior developer working halftime or fulltime in the role. We also present measures of the actual knowledge network of three Chinese and three Swedish teams and the TARs position in it.Conclusions: TARs are central in the knowledge network and act as the boundary spanners between the teams and between the sites. We learned that availability of the TARs across sites is lower than that with local TARs. We also found that the size of a team's knowledge network depends on how long the team members have been working in the company. Finally we discuss the advantages and the challenges of introducing experts in key roles in large scale distributed agile development.},

abstract = {Given a large graph with millions or billions of nodes and edges, like a who-follows-whom Twitter graph, how do we scalably compute its statistics, summarize its patterns, spot anomalies, visualize and make sense of it? We present OPAvion, a graph mining system that provides a scalable, interactive workflow to accomplish these analysis tasks. OPAvion consists of three modules: (1) The Summarization module (Pegasus) operates off-line on massive, disk-resident graphs and computes graph statistics, like PageRank scores, connected components, degree distribution, triangles, etc.; (2) The Anomaly Detection module (OddBall) uses graph statistics to mine patterns and spot anomalies, such as nodes with many contacts but few interactions with them (possibly telemarketers); (3) The Interactive Visualization module (Apolo) lets users incrementally explore the graph, starting with their chosen nodes or the flagged anomalous nodes; then users can expand to the nodes' vicinities, label them into categories, and thus interactively navigate the interesting parts of the graph.In our demonstration, we invite our audience to interact with OPAvion and try out its core capabilities on the Stack Overflow Q&amp;A graph that describes over 6 million questions and answers among 650K users.},

abstract = {Community Question-Answering (CQA), where questions and answers are generated by peers, has become a popular method of information seeking in online environments. While the content repositories created through CQA sites have been used widely to support general purpose tasks, using them as online digital libraries that support educational needs is an emerging practice. Horizontal CQA services, such as Yahoo! Answers, and vertical CQA services, such as Brainly, are aiming to help students improve their learning process by answering their educational questions. In these services, receiving high quality answer(s) to a question is a critical factor not only for user satisfaction, but also for supporting learning. However, the questions are not necessarily answered by experts, and the askers may not have enough knowledge and skill to evaluate the quality of the answers they receive. This could be problematic when students build their own knowledge base by applying inaccurate information or knowledge acquired from online sources. Using moderators could alleviate this problem. However, a moderator's evaluation of answer quality may be inconsistent because it is based on their subjective assessments. Employing human assessors may also be insufficient due to the large amount of content available on a CQA site. To address these issues, we propose a framework for automatically assessing the quality of answers. This is achieved by integrating different groups of features - personal, community-based, textual, and contextual - to build a classification model and determine what constitutes answer quality. To test this evaluation framework, we collected more than 10 million educational answers posted by more than 3 million users on Brainly's United States and Poland sites. The experiments conducted on these datasets show that the model using Random Forest (RF) achieves more than 83\% accuracy in identifying high quality of answers. In addition, the findings indicate that personal and community-based features have more prediction power in assessing answer quality. Our approach also achieves high values on other key metrics such as F1-score and Area under ROC curve. The work reported here can be useful in many other contexts where providing automatic quality assessment in a digital repository of textual information is paramount.},

We adapted the Quinn's competing value framework to classify their roles into eight types. That is, intermediary actors in science-policy process play roles as monitors, coordinators, directors, producers, innovators, brokers, facilitators and mentors. We developed a list of 40 functions with each role consisting of five functions. Based on several case examples setting intermediary actors playing one of the eight roles between scientists and policy makers, we found that the intermediary actors play not only the designated roles, but also other roles for knowledge transferring. In all cases, intermediary actors play most of facilitator and mentor functions. These functions make effective knowledge transferring, that is knowledge sharing among scientists and policy makers.},

abstract = {Knowledge is considered as the main competitive asset of the organization. One of the knowledge management (KM) cornerstones is improving productivity by effective knowledge sharing and transfer. However, from the game theory perspective, the main constraint is that people tend not to collaborate in uncertainty conditions, when collaborative behavior is not guaranteed, and sharing knowledge is time- and effort-consuming. Therefore, KM must be a practical aspect of the general organizational culture. Specifically, software development is a knowledge-intensive activity and its success depends heavily on the developers' knowledge and experience. In this presentation we highlight how the agile approach initiates a culture change that is in line with the culture change needed for a KM initiative. We discuss KM enablers that are embedded in the agile software engineering approach, and illustrate how collaborating processes and knowledge transparency can weaken the dilemmas people face and lead to better knowledge extraction and sharing.},

abstract = {Trust can be applied to knowledge sharing on a distributed network of knowledge source agents. Each agent represents a person who trusts some other agents. Based on these trust-relationships, an agent can infer the trustworthiness of an unknown agent by asking trusted agents for recommendations. However, the person represented by an agent may not be willing to share his or her individual opinion about the trustworthiness of a particular agent to agents that do not protect information privacy. A solution for this issue is proposed using three kinds of privacy policies: generosity, caution, and non-cooperation. An agent that adopts the caution policy towards another agent will hide the details of the trust recommendation path. An analysis shows the effect of the privacy policies on the calculated reliabilities of the recommended trust values.},

abstract = {Yahoo! Answers is currently one of the most popular question answering systems. We claim however that its user experience could be significantly improved if it could route the "right question" to the "right user." Indeed, while some users would rush answering a question such as "what should I wear at the prom?," others would be upset simply being exposed to it. We argue here that Community Question Answering sites in general and Yahoo! Answers in particular, need a mechanism that would expose users to questions they can relate to and possibly answer.We propose here to address this need via a multi-channel recommender system technology for associating questions with potential answerers on Yahoo! Answers. One novel aspect of our approach is exploiting a wide variety of content and social signals users regularly provide to the system and organizing them into channels. Content signals relate mostly to the text and categories of questions and associated answers, while social signals capture the various user interactions with questions, such as asking, answering, voting, etc. We fuse and generalize known recommendation approaches within a single symmetric framework, which incorporates and properly balances multiple types of signals according to channels. Tested on a large scale dataset, our model exhibits good performance, clearly outperforming standard baselines.},

abstract = {Networked Cyber-Physical Systems (NCPSs) present many challenges since they require a tight combination with the physical world as well as a balance between autonomous operation and coordination among heterogeneous nodes. These fundamental challenges range from how NCPSs are architected, implemented, composed, and programmed to how they can be validated. In this paper, we describe a new paradigm for programming an NCPS that enables users to specify their needs and nodes to contribute capabilities and resources. This new paradigm is based on the partially ordered knowledge-sharing model that makes explicit the abstract structure of a computation in space and time. Based on this model, we propose an application framework that provides a uniform abstraction for a wide range of NCPS applications, especially those concerned with distributed sensing, optimization, and control. The proposed framework provides a generic service to represent, manipulate, and share knowledge across the network under minimal assumptions on connectivity. Our framework is tested on a new distributed version of an evolutionary optimization algorithm that runs on a computing cluster and is also used to solve a dynamic distributed optimization problem in a simulated NCPS that uses mobile robots as controllable data mules.},

There are some commercialized systems of collaborative learning now. But they only provide some simple and easy tools for instructors and learners to organize learning. These systems don’t mainly consider knowledge management during collaborative learning processes. Collaborative learning system could not only support the learning, but also achieve a seamless knowledge flow among the collaborative team members. So this paper presents a framework for collaborative learning system that integrated knowledge management technology. It can more effectively support collaborative learning processes via Internet or Intranet. This paper performs the following tasks: (1) introduction knowledge management technology and CSCL(Computer Supported Collaborative Learning); (2) presentation of a framework for collaborative learning system based on knowledge management (CLS-KM ); (3) discussion of knowledge sharing collaborative modes between members; (4) implementation of a simple prototype system; (5) conclusion and expectation of the further work.},

abstract = {Community-based Question Answering (CQA) sites, such as Yahoo! Answers, Baidu Knows, Naver, and Quora, have been rapidly growing in popularity. The resulting archives of posted answers to questions, in Yahoo! Answers alone, already exceed in size 1 billion, and are aggressively indexed by web search engines. In fact, a large number of search engine users benefit from these archives, by finding existing answers that address their own queries. This scenario poses new challenges and opportunities for both search engines and CQA sites. To this end, we formulate a new problem of predicting the satisfaction of web searchers with CQA answers. We analyze a large number of web searches that result in a visit to a popular CQA site, and identify unique characteristics of searcher satisfaction in this setting, namely, the effects of query clarity, query-to-question match, and answer quality. We then propose and evaluate several approaches to predicting searcher satisfaction that exploit these characteristics. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to predict and validate the usefulness of CQA archives for external searchers, rather than for the original askers. Our results suggest promising directions for improving and exploiting community question answering services in pursuit of satisfying even more Web search queries.},

abstract = {Knowledge Management (KM) has become a key success factor in diverse fields, given the importance of knowledge as a significant organizational asset. In order to solve problems and support complex decision-making processes, knowledge and experience have to be transmitted across individuals, business units and organizations. Thus, Knowledge Sharing (KS) can be considered as the basic element of any knowledge-oriented process: KS fosters collaboration in complex environments, and facilitates experiential knowledge discovery, distribution and use. This paper presents a proposal for the development of a Community of Practice (CoP) called the E-Decisional Community. This community uses a domain-independent knowledge representation called Set of Experience Knowledge Structure (SOEKS), and captures the decisional fingerprint inside organizations using Decisional DNA. It is based on principles from different technologies namely Software Agents, Grid and Cloud computing, in order to provide an autonomous, intelligent and coordinated large-scale KS environment. The E-Decisional Community biggest concern is to promote experiential knowledge evolution and sharing through generations of decision-makers, aiming at the creation of a marketplace where knowledge is provided as a service.},

In this paper we analyze the characteristics of knowledge generation and user participation behavior in the largest question-answering online community in South Korea, Naver Knowledge-iN. We collected and analyzed over 2.6 million question/answer pairs from fifteen categories between 2002 and 2007, and have interviewed twenty six users to gain insights into their motivations,roles, usage and expertise. We find altruism, learning, and competency are frequent motivations for top answerers to participate, but that participation is often highly intermittent. Using a simple measure of user performance, we find that higher levels of participation correlate with better performance. We also observe that users are motivated in part through a point system to build a comprehensive knowledge database. These and other insights have significant implications for future knowledge generating online communities.},

abstract = {Business processes especially those in knowledge intensive environments often emerge rather than following predefined steps. Supporting emergent processes is one of the key issues for collaborative knowledge sharing. This paper first introduces a component-based workspace metamodel used to support emergent processes. A loose-coupled collaborative process management model WorkPath is proposed based on the workspace structure to support flexible process evolution management and coordination among processes. Key elements that construct workspace and WorkPath, such as role, action, artifact, workspace and reference relation, are described in detail. An implementation prototype and future work is also discussed at the end of the paper.},

abstract = {Organizations invest in the development of knowledge repositories (KR) to foster knowledge reuse and integration. Yet many KR initiatives fail to meet expectations, in part because knowledge workers underutilize the KR as a knowledge source. To date, little empirical research has considered how enabling characteristics of a KR influence individuals' propensity to use it as a knowledge source. This paper draws on extant knowledge management literature, including research on knowledge-based system design, to develop hypotheses relating key KR characteristics to KR knowledge sourcing behavior. These hypotheses are tested using survey data from 110 technical support agents from seven companies. Results reveal that support for online action (finding knowledge in the KR), support for offline action (applying retrieved knowledge to problem solving) and support for knowledge sharing are characteristics of a KR that predict its use as a knowledge source. Moreover, two of these relationships are moderated by the degree to which the knowledge worker retains autonomy in determining her work procedures. Implications for research and practice are discussed.},

abstract = {To deploy a memory protection mechanism, it requires CPU support hardware components like Memory Management Unit (MMU) or Memory Protection Unit (MPU). However, in embedded system, most of microcontrollers lack to be equipped these features because they cause the system incurred hardware cost and performance penalty. In this paper, a method to detect memory corruption at run-time without incurring hardware cost is proposed. Embedded system processor does not require having MMU or MPU. Off-chip detection based on FPGA by hooking on memory bus to monitor memory access for multitasking Realtime Operating System (RTOS) application is explored. Our solution, called MemMON, by combining hardware/software can detect memory access error such as task's stack overflow, task's reading/writing to code/data segments of the other tasks or memory access violation to OS kernel efficiently. In experimental evaluation, a comparison of realtime schedulability is carried out for both using and not using MemMON. Using our MemMON causes realtime schedulability of the system dropped-off about 3 times.},

Grounded on a communication-based view, we examined key drivers of user intention to share knowledge in virtual communities from three aspects: the knowledge to be shared, the individual self and the environment. In particular, a self-concept-based motivation model was employed to investigate individuals’ motivational factors. An empirical study of 363 virtual community users demonstrated the salient and dominant influences of enhanced knowledge self-efficacy and self-image on knowledge contribution intention. Enjoyment in helping others, trust and system usability were also found to be important motivations for knowledge sharing. Implications for both researchers and practitioners are discussed.},

In this article we argue that those technologies can be adapted to improve user experience in e-Learning; we present an online social bookmarking system called Social Semantic Collaborative Filtering (SSCF). SSCF supports SIOC (Semantically-Interlinked Online Communities) metadata which ultimately transforms it in to a browser of blogs, fora, and other community sites. We show how a digital library system, such as JeromeDL, utilising this technology can be used in the e-Learning process, which takes advantage of recent research in the Internet.},

To reach a high level of automation we propose to take an inference-based approach: codify best practices so that they can be reasoned about and adapted at runtime. Concerns specific to distributed systems are dealt with by the innate support for knowledge sharing. We introduce the methodology along with a reference architecture. The method\'{y}s validity is tested by applying a preliminary implementation to a handful of practical problems.},

In this paper we report on a longitudinal study in which we have followed a project over a three-year period. We compared software quality assurance processes and software defects of the project between a 17-month phase with a plan-driven process, followed by a 20-month phase with Scrum. The results of the study did not show a significant reduction of defect densities or changes of defect profiles after Scrum was used. However, the iterative nature of Scrum resulted in constant system and acceptance testing and related defect fixing, which made the development process more efficient in terms of fewer surprises and better control of software quality and release date. In addition, software quality and knowledge sharing got more focus when using Scrum. However, Scrum put more stress and time pressure on the developers, and made them reluctant to perform certain tasks for later maintenance, such as refactoring.},

Each SE Q&amp;A website is created to address questions on specific user interest or domain. However, often users post questions on SE websites that do not match the domain of the website. Such questions are considered as Off-topic for the origin site. Off-topic questions must be detected and migrated to more appropriate On-Topic site in SE network. Off-topic questions are migrated manually to other sites by moderators or experts users (through a voting process). The process of migrating questions from one site to other is known as Question Migration. We study migrated questions on SE Q&amp;A website. We identify several distinguishing features of migrated questions and propose a machine learning based framework to predict migrating questions. Effectiveness of proposed model is tested on five SE Q&amp;A sites. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model is effective (maximum accuracy of 73\%) in predicting migrating questions.},

In most cases, the domain expertise is not available which increases the complexity to manifold. A critical success factor in such a scenario is to have a collaborative platform for managing and sharing the domain specific knowledge across distributed locations. In our ongoing research we have developed a human assisted collaborative knowledge sharing tool called CollabDev. The aim of this tool is to analyze applications in multiple languages and render various structural, architectural, and functional insights to the people involved in maintenance. The novelty of this platform lies in integrating different elements of application knowledge by linking them to source code and allowing multiple developers to collaborate on-line by using annotations for the knowledge elements. The platform also provides diagnostic information on architecture of source code.},

Organizations must grapple with issues such as how partial knowledge is shared across functional and task-related application domains, how knowledge-work practices in different workgroups are defined and coordinated, and how knowledge is embedded in various forms of ICT. These issues are all related to distributed ways of knowing.

By drawing on relevant insights from IT innovations literature, our conceptual piece of research aims at identifying organizational context factors which are critical for the success of business process outsourcing (BPO) as part of a firm's overall Business Process Management activities. More specifically, process readiness, IT readiness and business management readiness are proposed to be important dimensions of organizational readiness for BPO. Furthermore, IT business alignment, as a routine-based process of knowledge sharing and creation, is proposed to be a driver of organizational readiness for BPO.},

abstract = {Question recommendation that automatically recommends a new question to suitable users to answer is an appealing and challenging problem in the research area of Community Question Answering (CQA). Unlike in general recommender systems where a user has only a single role, each user in CQA can play two different roles (dual roles) simultaneously: as an asker and as an answerer. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first to systematically investigate the distinctions between the two roles and their different influences on the performance of question recommendation in CQA. Moreover, we propose a Dual Role Model (DRM) to model the dual roles of users effectively. With different indepen-dence assumptions, two variants of DRM are achieved. Finally, we present the DRM based approach to question recommendation which provides a mechanism for naturally integrating the user relation between the answerer and the asker with the content re-levance between the answerer and the question into a uni-fied probabilistic framework. Experiments using a real-world data crawled from Yahoo! Answers show that: (1) there are evident distinctions between the two roles of users in CQA. Additionally, the answerer role is more effective than the asker role for modeling candidate users in question recommendation; (2) compared with baselines utilizing a single role or blended roles based methods, our DRM based approach consistently and significantly improves the performance of question recommendation, demonstrating that our approach can model the user in CQA more reasonably and precisely.},

This paper discusses the main challenges of supporting cross-community knowledge exchange and presents an approach to addressing them based on collaborative knowledge visualization. The developed method enables the visualization of implicit structures of personal and community knowledge and their use for multi-perspective access to community information spaces. The results of an empirical evaluation in a comparative laboratory study suggest that this method provides valuable support for facilitating crosscommunity knowledge exchange.},

Due to their time-constrained nature and the anonymity among members, we believe that team goal commitment might be a more pertinent factor driving task performance. We hypothesize that members' perceived distributive, interactional, and procedural justice are viable antecedents leading to the inducement of team goal commitment among virtual project team members. A longitudinal field experiment was carried out to test these hypotheses. The results suggest that: (1) distributive justice is a consistently strong predictor of team goal commitment over time; (2) the effect of interactional justice on team goal commitment manifests over time, and; (3) procedural justice has no effect on team goal commitment over time. Implications for both theory and practice are discussed.},

abstract = {An increasingly popular method for finding information online is via the Community Question Answering (CQA) portals such as Yahoo! Answers, Naver, and Baidu Knows. Searching the CQA archives, and ranking, filtering, and evaluating the submitted answers requires intelligent processing of the questions and answers posed by the users. One important task is automatically detecting the question's subjectivity orientation: namely, whether a user is searching for subjective or objective information. Unfortunately, real user questions are often vague, ill-posed, poorly stated. Furthermore, there has been little labeled training data available for real user questions. To address these problems, we present CoCQA, a co-training system that exploits the association between the questions and contributed answers for question analysis tasks. The co-training approach allows CoCQA to use the effectively unlimited amounts of unlabeled data readily available in CQA archives. In this paper we study the effectiveness of CoCQA for the question subjectivity classification task by experimenting over thousands of real users' questions.},

The two main trees are delegated to solving two different visual tasks and are allowed to share knowledge with each other by calling the remaining GP trees (subfunctions) included in the same individual. The method is applied to the visual learning task of recognizing simple shapes, using generative approach based on visual primitives. We compare this approach to a reference method devoid of knowledge sharing, and conclude that in the worst case cross-task learning performs equally well, and in many cases it leads to significant performance improvements in one or both solved tasks.},

In this paper we examine the suitability of Web Search Engines (SE)and Community Question-Answering (community QA) to satisfy the different expectations of users: queries expecting knowledge-based answers, and queries expecting subjective opinion-based answers. From this categorization, we conducted a user study of the results obtained from three Web SE, and three Communities QA. In this way, we found that SE result in a better alternative when the query is designed to get a uni-objective answer, while communities QA provide better results if the question gets multi-objective answers. On the other hand, when the query expects a subjective answer, none of these systems provides a very effective answer that can fulfill the expectations from the user. Knowing more about the type of queries that require human support would be useful to improve the user search experience in SE.},

abstract = {The impact of open source software development has challenged commercial companies and government bodies alike to develop new strategies for a changing information and communication technology (ICT) environment. The balanced scorecard---already a widely recognized management best-practice---is well-suited both as a framework for this imperative, and as a mechanism for knowledge-sharing between industry and public sector managers.First, a balanced scorecard initiative must embrace a multi-disciplinary, multi-stakeholder and community-oriented approach, taking into account the needs of diverse constituencies. Second, public sector e-Government leaders can benefit from the same robust perspective on learning, innovation, and customer satisfaction in addition to financial measures that the balanced scorecard has brought to private sector managers.This paper shares the experience of one commercial company (Microsoft Corporation) taking a balanced scorecard approach to open source policy and strategy development, and offers an analysis of implications and opportunities for e-Government leaders.},

Online Collaborative Lesson Preparation (OCLP) is a platform for teachers to create, share and utilize their knowledge. This paper adopts Ikujiro Nonaka and Hirotaka Takeuchi's knowledge management (KM) theory so as to effectively manage the knowledge and to provide the lesson preparation community the mechanism for the dialogue space and knowledge sharing. According to our research experience, we defined the role orientation of OCLP system from the perspective of SECI model, a KM strategy in OCLP and the practical application of KM associated with the workflow of OCLP are also depicted in this paper. The method of the research adopts systematical research. The researchers collect the practical lesson preparation community's critical knowledge, which is built and managed by the OCLP system.},

abstract = {Reliability issues arise in Peer-to-Peer Semantic Knowledge Sharing (P2PSKS) systems. P2PSKS systems are prone to disconnection failures. Disconnection failures deprive the network peers from having access to complete knowledge in the PSPSKS system. Disconnection failures arise when the P2PSKS systems employ the adaptive query routing methods in order to avoid flooding the networks with redundant search messages or queries during information exchange. P2PSKS systems need to utilize fault-tolerant query result evaluation function in order to be reliable. The current publication will focus on two objectives in P2PSKS research: 1. reliability problem identification and 2. reliability problem solutions. The P2PSKS system reliability problem will be identified through the use of simulation modeling techniques. The P2PSKS system reliability problem solutions will be advanced through adaptations of the generous tit-for-tat method which was originally developed in evolutionary game theory. The current research will demonstrate more reliable solutions to address P2PSKS system reliability issues by advancing the Fault-Tolerant Adaptive Query Routing (FTAQR) algorithm.},

We adapted the Quinn’s competing value framework to classify their roles into eight types. That is, intermediary actors in science-policy process play roles as monitors, coordinators, directors, producers, innovators, brokers, facilitators and mentors. We developed a list of 40 functions with each role consisting of five functions. Based on several case examples setting intermediary actors playing one of the eight roles between scientists and policy makers, we found that the intermediary actors play not only the designated roles, but also other roles for knowledge transferring. In all cases, intermediary actors play most of facilitator and mentor functions. These functions make effective knowledge transferring, that is knowledge sharing among scientists and policy makers.},

Electronic commerce is an example of such systems. In this project, we introduce a model and devise an implementation for the large-scale knowledge sharing using Bayesian networks, game theory and network security. The agent model for the system components blends the traditional expert systems' reasoning engine with a multi-layer knowledge base, communication and documentation engines. Electronic Commerce (EC) is a potential application for such a system. EC is viewed as a society of software agents, such as customer, search, catalog, manufacturer, dealer, delivery and banker agents, distributed over the Internet and interact and negotiate with each other.},

abstract = {Community Question Answering (CQA) sites such as Yahoo! Answers have emerged as rich knowledge resources for information seekers. However, answers posted to CQA sites can be irrelevant, incomplete, redundant, incorrect, biased, ill-formed or even abusive. Hence, automatic selection of "good" answers for a given posted question is a practical research problem that will help us manage the quality of accumulated knowledge. One way to evaluate answer selection systems for CQA would be to use the Best Answers (BAs) that are readily available from the CQA sites. However, BAs may be biased, and even if they are not, there may be other good answers besides BAs. To remedy these two problems, we propose system evaluation methods that involve multiple answer assessors and graded-relevance information retrieval metrics. Our main findings from experiments using the NTCIR-8 CQA task data are that, using our evaluation methods, (a) we can detect many substantial differences between systems that would have been overlooked by BA-based evaluation; and (b) we can better identify hard questions (i.e. those that are handled poorly by many systems and therefore require focussed investigation) compared to BAbased evaluation. We therefore argue that our approach is useful for building effective CQA answer selection systems despite the cost of manual answer assessments.},

The ease and speed with which staff can adapt to new projects and environments is crucial for the success and profitability of the consultancy company. This paper investigates how management in a Swedish software company can facilitate test staff relocation practices. Consultants in the testing department were interviewed to elicit the differences between testing projects they are involved in and their views on the challenges of and learning needed when relocating between projects. Based on this we present an approach to better support such staff relocations. The approach is based on a knowledge sharing process and the introduction of specific templates to capture testing experience. Initial, static validation in the associated company shows that the approach has merit and should be further evaluated.},

The library has been in fruitful practical use for four years.We present the library as an implementation of an abstract machine derived by elaborating the definitional machine. The abstract view lets us distill a minimalistic API , scAPI , sufficient for implementing multi-prompt delimited control. We argue that a language system that supports exception and stack-overflow handling supports scAPI . Our library illustrates how to use scAPI to implement multi-prompt delimited control in a typed language. The approach is general and can be used to add multi-prompt delimited control to other existing language systems.},

All the projects were citizen-oriented, ICT-driven and grouped into main five project clusters, so-called "Five P.O.I.N.T.s": (1) Kri\v{z}evci info Platform, (2) Direct Actions, (3) Education, (4) Culture Shock, (5) e-Publishing. During the given timeline, at least two of the projects coexisted in the community and became partly interconnected. The positive user feedback from one of the projects drove to success of the other, showing the evolution nature of these so-called "digital components" in this online local community digital ecosystem. Online collaboration between other local and regional organizations was also a vital part of daily interaction and knowledge sharing, so the aim was also to provide continuous and free internet hosting services to all the partners and associates in order to enforce these goals. Future project development efforts will include fully functional implementation and deploying of new web-based social media platform for sustainable online local community. This paper presents a chronological case study of building and running an ICT-driven NGO, representing its projects as digital components from the project clusters that coexist in the local community digital ecosystem.},

A case in which an ODBS failed to foster the interactions among learners / instructors for knowledge sharing is introduced and hypotheses to explain the failure are developed based on thorough literature review in technology acceptance model (TAM) and knowledge hoarding. The hypotheses are tested via statistical analysis on the data collected from a questionnaire survey against the students who actually involved in the case study. The result shows that the low perceived usefulness of the ODBS by the students played major role in the failure of the system. Also it is hinted that network externalities as an intrinsic motivator is more effective than extrinsic motivators to increase the students' activities on the ODBS. Finally the paper provides the designers of eLearning systems with advice for successful operation of ODBS in eLearning.},

abstract = {Effective conceptual modeling requires a shared understanding of the concepts that are found in an application domain. Achieving such understanding, especially for large design problems, is a challenging, and long-standing problem. Conceptual models tend to be either subjective representations of individuals that require mutual knowledge sharing between members of a modeling team or externalized normative representations that require knowledge transfer from model preceptors to model receptors. Model preceptors have either created a conceptual model or conceived it by another preceptor. In prior studies, normative conceptual models were used to investigate knowledge transfer between preceptors and receptors. This research, in contrast, investigates knowledge transfer of conceptual models between model owners and receptors. A 2x2 study design with modeling novices was used that varied the type of conceptual modeling language and the type of information system. Further testing investigated whether knowledge transfers were affected by additional verbal explanations given by the preceptor. Each modeler was provided access to two conceptual modeling languages that naturally support structure or process representations. The study investigated whether the use of particular conceptual modeling languages differ in their effects on shared understanding between two persons and whether additional verbal explanations might increase shared understanding. The results of this exploratory empirical study provide useful insights into the use of Conceptual Modeling Language pairs for shared understanding in conceptual modeling in small groups.},

Main contributions to research in the field of web computing and CSCW are (1) an experience report on how to shape web-based coordination support for care planning and (2) a discussion of how to apply concepts from the areas communities of practice and coordination mechanisms to the field of care planning. Analysis of facilities useful for communities of practice led to a number of proposals for functional enhancement of the developed application in the field of knowledge sharing. The concept of computational coordination mechanisms was very helpful for understanding the nature of care planning work and evaluating the coordination support provided.},

abstract = {As the exponential growth of information generated on the World Wide Web, Social Recommendation has emerged as one of the hot research topics recently. Social Recommendation forms a specific type of information filtering technique that attempts to suggest information (blogs, news, music, travel plans, web pages, images, tags, etc.) that are likely to interest the users. Social Recommendation involves the investigation of collective intelligence by using computational techniques such as machine learning, data mining, natural language processing, etc. on social behavior data collected from blogs, wikis, recommender systems, question \&amp; answer communities, query logs, tags, etc. from areas such as social networks, social search, social media, social bookmarks, social news, social knowledge sharing, and social games. In this tutorial, we will introduce Social Recommendation and elaborate on how the various characteristics and aspects are involved in the social platforms for collective intelligence. Moreover, we will discuss the challenging issues involved in Social Recommendation in the context of theory and models of social networks, methods to improve recommender systems using social contextual information, ways to deal with partial and incomplete information in the social context, scalability and algorithmic issues with social computational techniques.},

Thus, it is essential to clarify the structure of knowledge in ontologies. In this paper, we discuss how ontology developers can define the identity conditions of classes explicitly, and can utilize them to develop structured taxonomies with adequate consistency. The background of this paper is OntoClean which is a domain independent methodology for ontology modeling using some philosophical notions. We exemplify the classification of sorts with necessary conceptual constraints. Then, we provide an explicit, simplified, and practical ontological analysis system regarding our subsumption constraints.},

To address the comment scarcity issue, we propose a new automatic comment generation approach, which mines comments from a large programming Question and Answer (Q&amp;A) site. Q&amp;A sites allow programmers to post questions and receive solutions, which contain code segments together with their descriptions, referred to as code-description mappings. We develop AutoComment to extract such mappings, and leverage them to generate description comments automatically for similar code segments matched in open-source projects. We apply AutoComment to analyze Java and Android tagged Q&amp;A posts to extract 132,767 code-description mappings, which help AutoComment to generate 102 comments automatically for 23 Java and Android projects. The user study results show that the majority of the participants consider the generated comments accurate, adequate, concise, and useful in helping them understand the code.},

Updating and maintaining an ontology requires highly specialized experts and is very time-consuming given the amount of literature that has to be analyzed and the difficulty in reaching consensus.This paper outlines a proposal for the development of automated processes for the enrichment of the Gene Ontology (GO) that will use text mining techniques and ontology alignment techniques to extract new terms and relations. We also identify the areas of GO whose level of detail is too low to answer the community's needs at large. We have found that although GO's content is well suited to the manual annotations, revealing the coordination between GO developers and GO annotators, there are 17 areas that would benefit from enrichment to support electronic annotation efforts.With this work we hope to provide biomedical researchers with an extended version of GO that can be used 'as is' or by GO developers as a starting point to enrich GO.},

The proposed concepts are demonstrated on the basis of a selected area of medical studies: the analysis of the incidence of hospital infections. Sample ontologies (exhibiting structural or lexical similarities) have been developed and for each case a suitable algorithm is proposed.},

Secondly, the researcher explores the relations among KM style, classroom climate, and learning attitude. The conclusion can be: teacher's KM style from the senior high school students' perception is that the knowledge application is mostly used, then knowledge sharing, and the last, knowledge creation. The classroom climate from the senior high school students' perception is generally positive. The students' learning attitude is active, but should be improved. The senior high school teacher's KM style and learning attitude are closely related. The students' positive classroom climate will benefit the learning attitude, and the learning attitude will convey positive impact on the teacher's knowledge management. Teacher's KM style and classroom climate will have good predict ability to learning attitude.},

abstract = {Current views of sustainable development recognize the importance of accepting the Indigenous Knowledge (IK) of rural people. However, there is an increasing technological gap between Elder IK holders and the younger generation and a persistent incompatibility between IK and the values, logics and literacies embedded, and supported by ICT. Here, we present an evaluation of new technology that might bridge generations and preserve key elements of local IK in Namibia. We describe how we applied insights, generated by ethnographic, dialogical and participatory action research, in designing a structure in which users can store, organize and retrieve user-generated videos in ways that are compatible with their knowledge system. The structure embeds videos in a scenario-based 3D visualization of a rural village. It accounts for some of the ways this rural community manages information, socially, spatially and temporally and provides users with a recognizable 3D simulated environment in which to re-contextualize de-contextualized video clips. Our formative in situ evaluation of a prototype suggests the visualization is legible to community members, provokes participation in design discussions, offers opportunities for local appropriation and may facilitate knowledge sharing between IK holders and more youthful IK assimilators. Simultaneously differing interpretations of scenarios and modeled objects reveal the limitations of our modeling decisions and raises various questions regarding graphic design details and regional transferability.},

However, comparisons of how KM capabilities and KS Culture perform in similar contexts (same organization) but different goals (separate business units) are limited. Invariance testing is used as a method to assess the similarity between groups. Data collected from knowledge workers at two business units from a large microchip manufacturing company identifies KS cultural differences and yet provides evidence of similar functioning on the KM capability scales.

The problem is to what extend the user can trust the blogs. Blog is a technical media of knowledge sharing between professional technical bloggers. They publish various technical contents which is very new to blog readers. It creates some incredible questions to blogs readers. So it is necessary for the researchers to address this issue to assure the blog reader that the blog is credible.

Using search engines to retrieve the documents can harvest lots of information, facilitating information exchange and knowledge sharing, including foreign information. However, to better understand by local readers, foreign words, like English, are often translated to local language such as Chinese. Due to different translators and the lack of translation standard, translating foreign words may pose a notorious headache and result in different transliterations, particularly in proper nouns like person names and geographical names. For example, "Bin Laden" is translated into terms "???"(binladeng) or "???"(benladeng). Both are valid synonymous transliterations. In this research, we propose an approach to determining synonymous transliterations via mining Web pages retrieved by a search engine. Experiments show that the proposed approach can effectively extract synonymous transliterations given an input transliteration.},

Although the number of existing information security risk management methodologies is enormous, in practice a lot of resources are invested by organizations in creating new information security risk management methodologies. This is a crucial knowledge-intensive process for organizations, but in most cases it is addressed in an ad hoc manner. We believe that the existence of a systematic approach for the development of new (and the improvement of existing) information security risk management methodologies would enhance the effectiveness of the process. In this paper we propose a systematic meta-process for developing new, or improving existing, information security risk management methods. We also present our vision for a collaboration and knowledge-sharing platform capable of supporting a virtual intra-organizational cross-disciplinary team, which aims at improving information security risk management methodologies by adopting the proposed meta-process.},

At the user level, it has been employed extensively to develop various analysis, bug-finding, and security tools. Such tools are currently not available for operating system (OS) binaries since no comprehensive DBT framework exists for the OS kernel. To address this problem, we have developed a DBT framework that runs as a Linux kernel module, based on the user-level DynamoRIO framework. Our approach is unique in that it controls all kernel execution, including interrupt and exception handlers and device drivers, enabling comprehensive instrumentation of the OS without imposing any overhead on user-level code. In this paper, we discuss the key challenges in designing and building an in-kernel DBT framework and how the design differs from user-space. We use our framework to build several sample instrumentations, including simple instruction counting as well as an implementation of shadow memory for the kernel. Using the shadow memory, we build a kernel stack overflow protection tool and a memory addressability checking tool. Qualitatively, the system is fast enough and stable enough to run the normal desktop workload of one of the authors for several weeks.},

To address this problem, we have developed a DBT framework that runs as a Linux kernel module, based on the user-level DynamoRIO framework. Our approach is unique in that it controls all kernel execution, including interrupt and exception handlers and device drivers, enabling comprehensive instrumentation of the OS without imposing any overhead on user-level code. In this paper, we discuss the key challenges in designing and building an in-kernel DBT framework and how the design differs from user-space. We use our framework to build several sample instrumentations, including simple instruction counting as well as an implementation of shadow memory for the kernel. Using the shadow memory, we build a kernel stack overflow protection tool and a memory addressability checking tool. Qualitatively, the system is fast enough and stable enough to run the normal desktop workload of one of the authors for several weeks.},

abstract = {Discrete-event simulation (DES) is used to evaluate alternative resource configurations and production operation plans and schedules in the manufacturing environment. However, benefits from using simulation to guide these decisions has to be weighed against the time and cost usually required to create and exercise the simulations. Where such decisions are taken frequently, a common practice is to create a simulator which accommodates the typical production alternatives, and link it to an Excel-database for specifying the scenario and displaying the simulation results. This is an effective approach when the simulator can be reused with sufficient frequency, but it suffers from several deficiencies. It can be difficult to maintain the simulator in conformance with the actual production capabilities (changing products, changing processes, etc). Knowledge about the production process is captured in the simulator and in the Excel-database, neither of which is a particularly effective knowledge sharing platform. We propose an alternative model-driven approach that automates the creation of DES models from SysML models specified using domain-specific semantics. Our approach enables domain stakeholders to define the problem in its own terms, and eliminates manual simulation model coding. In an industrial case study, we have used Arena™ as the DES platform and created a domain specific language (DSL) for electronics assembly. Not only is knowledge about production captured in a form that is accessible by all the stakeholders, the time and cost for simulation analysis is reduced by an order of magnitude.},

Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) tools represent a key platform to support knowledge sharing at multi-disciplinary design teams working under collaborative engineering concepts. However, an important issue is to capture valuable expertise at collaborative work using the PLM platform reusing key knowledge. This paper contributes to knowledge management showing how the usage of knowledge structures at a PLM environment is suitable for assembly engineering applications. The present research encompasses multidisciplinary engineering work teams defining the assembly process of an airplane part. This paper argues that knowledge structures enable the capture and exchange of expertise at collaborative work increasing value added between collaborators. A case study is presented to validate this idea.},

isbn = {9780769555942},
publisher = {IEEE Press},
abstract = {API design is known to be a challenging craft, as API designers must balance their elegant ideals against "real-world" concerns, such as utility, performance, backwards compatibility, and unforeseen emergent uses. However, to date, there is no principled method to collect or analyze API usability information that incorporates input from typical developers. In practice, developers often turn to Q&amp;A websites such as stackoverflow.com (SO) when seeking expert advice on API use; the popularity of such sites has thus led to a very large volume of unstructured information that can be searched with diligence for answers to specific questions. The collected wisdom within such sites could, in principle, be of great help to API designers to better support developer needs, if only it could be collected, analyzed, and distilled for practical use.In this paper, we present a methodology that combines several techniques, including social network analysis and topic mining, to recommend SO posts that are likely to concern API design-related issues. To establish a comparison baseline, we introduce two more recommendation approaches: a reputation-based recommender and a random recommender. We have found that when applied to Q&amp;A discussion of two popular mobile platforms, Android and iOS, our methodology achieves up to 93\% accuracy and is more stable with its recommendations when compared to the two baseline techniques.},

Social capital is built on the foundation of social interactions; developing and maintaining it relies on communications that are increasingly supported by communication technologies (CT). Various studies have reported that computer-mediated communication (CMC) increases, decreases and has no effect on social capital [10]. These conflicting effects necessitate a disaggregated approach to theoretical understanding and empirical analysis of effects of CMC on social capital. In this research program, I synthesize and extend research on CMC and social capital by theorizing about the influence of CT on structural, cognitive, and relational social capital and thus on the outcomes of the social capital such as information sharing, satisfaction and performance.},

abstract = {In this paper, we explore the different ways in which people collaborate and share knowledge in public Internet venues, or cybercaf\'{e}s, in Ghana, West Africa. Based on 150 survey interviews conducted in two different cybercaf\'{e}s, one urban and business-oriented and the other peri-urban and family-oriented, we find that most cybercaf\'{e} customers, largely regardless of their demographic, would like to engage in collaborative work in public Internet venues and that a large percentage already are.Contrary to the belief of resource constraints driving shared use, those participants who reported already working together in the cybercaf\'{e}s generally did not cite economic motivations for their collaboration but instead identified enhanced productivity as the main reason. These collaborating respondents also reported performing more instrumental activities in the caf\'{e} and were more likely to have learned critical computing skills there when compared to those who were not already collaborating. Furthermore, they report being more social in their activities at the venue. Finally, we note that collaboration and peer learning is not always planned or made public; voyeuristic forms of knowledge sharing, such as when someone glances at a stranger's computer screen, are also cited by our survey participants as a learning opportunity in these public venues.We argue that these reported benefits demonstrate a unique value of public Internet venues, where collaboration is shown to be a tool for learning, enhancing productivity, and facilitating instrumental output.},

Essentially, UIE is composed of collections of Ubiquitous Intelligent Objects (UIOs) and their interactions. Conceptualize and abstract the UIOs as well as exploring more UIO-oriented applications are essential to the future development of UIEs. However, so far, there has been no work on the formal description and modeling of UIOs. Addressing this deficiency, in this paper, we study the modeling of UIOs. We identify the model design principles and develop a model for representing the abstract data types and operations, as well as the relationships between the UIOs. We also discuss the challenging issues in implementing the model and present a ubiquitous searching application as an example to show how the proposed modeling techniques can be used.

abstract = {This paper presents an ontology-based approach to promote the interoperability among agents that represent their knowledge through Bayesian networks. This research relies on Semantic Web foundations to achieve knowledge interoperability in the context of multiagent systems. Our first step was the specification of an ontology that formalizes the structures of the Bayesian network representation. It was developed using OWL, which is a W3C recommendation for ontology language. Once handled the issue of the knowledge representation, we specify how a Bayesian agent operates such representation. Thus, we define a model of internal architecture to support Bayesian agents in the knowledge sharing and maintenance tasks. The utilization of the architecture is exemplified through a case study developed in the context of a multiagent educational portal (PortEdu). The case study demonstrates the interoperability resulted from the architecture integration with Bayesian agents hosted in PortEdu.},

abstract = {Matching of heterogeneous knowledge sources is of increasing importance in areas such as scientific knowledge management, e-commerce, enterprise application integration, and many emerging Semantic Web applications. With the desire of knowledge sharing and reuse in these fields, it is common that the knowledge coming from different organizations from the same domain is to be matched. We propose a knowledge matching method based on our previously developed tree mining algorithms for extracting frequently occurring subtrees from a tree structured database such as XML. Using the method the common structure among the different representations can be automatically extracted. Our focus is on knowledge matching at the structural level and we use a set of example XML schema documents from the same domain to evaluate the method. We discuss some important issues that arise when applying tree mining algorithms for detection of common document structures. The experiments demonstrate the usefulness of the approach.},

abstract = {The sharing of knowledge, including information and know-how, if properly managed, allows the participating firms to enhance operation efficiency and decision making effectiveness. While there is a substantive research on the potential benefits of knowledge sharing, we do not have enough understanding of the factors leading firms to share knowledge. Drawing upon Transaction Cost Economics and Socio-political theories, we derive a research model to study the antecedent factors of firm's decision on whether to share knowledge with its trading partners. The theoretical model derived is tested by data collected with six companies, which had been sharing information and know-how with some of their trading partners. Implication and contributions of this study are discussed.},

abstract = {The resource management in 3G systems with multi-nodes environment is a demanding task to provide flexible and higher bandwidth services. To cope multi-nodes environment heterogeneity, there is a need of intelligent RNC (Radio Network Controller) at BS (Base Station), which cooperates to adapt and retrieve information to manage the resources intelligently and reliably in a consistent manner. Knowledge sharing for radio resource management, at cell level is a novel approach presented in this paper. The proposed architecture has induced the global effect through local information sharing to make reliable and consistent decisions. It provides efficient solutions for symmetric scenarios at different locations without replication of knowledge base. Our inference engine adapts the closest information retrieved from the knowledge repository efficiently through distant indexed values technique. Consequently, an Autonomous and Sociable RNC accepts, rejects or buffers a connection request to mange resources to meet QoS requirement as defined in Service Level Agreement (SLA).},

abstract = {For enterprises, customer relationships have been commonly recognized as a critical factor to succeed their business. Effective customer relationships could help enterprises deliver services to customers based on their needs, preferences, or past transactions. In this context, many discussions have already been presented where Consumer Support Systems (CSS) is most recently introduced that alleviates the shortcomings in other approaches by a 4-layer framework of collaborative mechanisms to support effective information/ service provision between enterprises and customers. Since in CSS customers get used to participate in various communities to share or co-learn information about their experiences or requests on enterprises, a comprehensive structure for such information is therefore necessary for its easy sharing or co-learning among these customers. For this need and as a pristine way for knowledge-sharing by ontology, we present in this paper a method for the construction of an ontology that describes customer information with an easy understood structure. The method starts from the specification of the ontology based on the experiences of customers, through the browsing of their new ideas, and ends with the verification of its consistency. To illustrate, the method is applied in an exemplified application for travel arrangement.},

abstract = {The proposed hyper knowledge discovery system is designed to facilitate domain users to interactively discover knowledge from complex data sets. At the first stage, this system integrates data preprocess, lexicon establishment and database construction together. Then it provides domain users with flexibility and fuzzy mechanism to retrieve information and mine knowledge interactively. The system introduces an approach to obtain joint probability distributions of an arbitrary number of variables of multi valued states. This is fundamental for mining correlation and causal relations from the complex data sources. To attain these objectives, the system creatively exploits the functionalities of the relational database and SQL engine to reduce programming while achieving good performance. All the functionalities are online and hence facilitate resource and knowledge sharing. Key words: hyper knowledge discovery system, data mining, interactive information search, fuzzy search, complex data source, multi valued state data source, database construction.},

abstract = {In collocated organisation-based work settings, knowledge workers often approach problem solving by combining explicit domain information with their practice-based knowledge in ways that are largely driven by their specific work context. In virtual collaborative work, such common grounds for decision making offered by a shared work context hardly exist. Designing context-aware systems to support decision making in virtual collaboration, thus, poses a huge challenge because of the inherent difficulty in establishing a shared context of work and users adequate for supporting cohesive collaboration and knowledge sharing among individuals across boundaries. To address this problem, this paper proposes a framework, which incorporates an explicit model of context between the domain model of an application and the activity landscapes of various individuals, workgroups and organisations collaborating across borders, and between these landscapes and the knowledge resource space model in an intelligent ubiquitous environment. We suggest that as a result of the high level of knowledge required in collaborative e-work as well as its changing work contexts, e-work support systems need to provide not only information in the form of documents and articles, but also expert-level explanations in the form of supporting literature and references to theories and related cases, to justify retrieved information and offer cognitive support to e-work.},

abstract = {The high demand to improve the quality of the presentation in the knowledge sharing field is to compete with rapidly growing technology. The needs for development of technology based learning and training lead to an idea to develop an Oil and Gas Plant Virtual Environment (OGPVE) for the benefit of our future. Panoramic Virtual Reality learning based environment is essential in order to help educators overcome the limitations in traditional technical writing lesson. Virtual reality will help users to understand better by providing the simulations of real-world and hard to reach environment with high degree of realistic experience and interactivity. Thus, in order to create a courseware which will achieve the objective, accurate images of intended scenarios must be acquired. The panorama shows the OGPVE and helps to generate ideas to users on what they have learnt. This paper discusses part of the development in panoramic virtual reality. The important phases for developing successful panoramic image are image acquisition and image stitching or mosaicing. In this paper, the combination of wide field-of-view (FOV) and close up image used in this panoramic development are also discussed.},

abstract = {The success of knowledge-sharing communities like Wikipedia and the advances in automatic information extraction from textual and Web sources have made it possible to build large "knowledge repositories" such as DBpedia, Freebase, and YAGO. These collections can be viewed as graphs of entities and relationships (ER graphs) and can be represented as a set of subject-property-object (SPO) triples in the Semantic-Web data model RDF. Queries can be expressed in the W3C-endorsed SPARQL language or by similarly designed graph-pattern search. However, exact-match query semantics often fall short of satisfying the users' needs by returning too many or too few results. Therefore, IR-style ranking models are crucially needed.In this paper, we propose a language-model-based approach to ranking the results of exact, relaxed and keyword-augmented graph pattern queries over RDF graphs such as ER graphs. Our method estimates a query model and a set of result-graph models and ranks results based on their Kullback-Leibler divergence with respect to the query model. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our ranking model by a comprehensive user study.},

This paper reports on a study with a method of conceptual analysis to elicit, analyse and compare conceptual models used by individual researchers, with the ultimate aim to facilitate researchers in sharing and integrating their conceptual notions. We build on an earlier study by extending an existing conceptual model with conceptual notions from two additional researchers from an interdisciplinary research project. The results of the present study suggest that the time costs of adding more information to the existing model diminish with each addition to the existing model, and that the method of conceptual analysis can validly represent researchers' conceptual notions. Furthermore, our results offer some indication that conceptual analysis can reduce transaction costs related to grounding.},

Tangible interfaces that support the modelling process in an intuitive way could help to reduce the cognitive load when leveraging individual mental models of work processes. In a collaborative setting the immediate and concurrent manipulation of model elements fosters the reflection and discussion of both modelling a work domain and corresponding processes. In this way, it facilitates the development of common views on work tasks and knowledge sharing.},

A model presented in this paper is the main result of an on-going national science foundation project of china, called Emergency-Driven Virtual Organization (EDVO), which aims at building and developing an innovative software infrastructure (software, models, services, etc.) for supporting collaborative work of events handling in emergency response systems. The model is to describe all kinds of resources in unified semantics and make knowledge sharing among various systems possible. With this basis, related resources and services can be flexibly and dynamically organized as a virtual organization to handle different kinds of emergent events.},

While these sites generate an enormous volume of searchable data, the problem of determining which questions and answers are archival quality has grown. One major component of this problem is the prevalence of conversational questions, identified both by Q&amp;A sites and academic literature as questions that are intended simply to start discussion. For example, a conversational question such as "do you believe in evolution?" might successfully engage users in discussion, but probably will not yield a useful web page for users searching for information about evolution. Using data from three popular Q&amp;A sites, we confirm that humans can reliably distinguish between these conversational questions and other informational questions, and present evidence that conversational questions typically have much lower potential archival value than informational questions. Further, we explore the use of machine learning techniques to automatically classify questions as conversational or informational, learning in the process about categorical, linguistic, and social differences between different question types. Our algorithms approach human performance, attaining 89.7\% classification accuracy in our experiments.},

It is not only a question of pricing and marketing the services appropriately, but also about keeping competitors from imitating them. In this study protecting service innovations against imitation are discussed in relation to the case of Finnish mobile TV. The aim is to examine how service innovation differs from other types of innovation in terms of protection, and how this shows in collaborative innovation activities. Our results indicate that characteristics that separate service innovations from product or process innovations may notably influence efficacy of protection. Furthermore, as creation of service innovations often includes collaborative activities, there is yet another twist to protection issues: On the one hand, companies should protect their knowledge in order to secure their positions. On the other hand, they need to foster knowledge sharing, which may be in conflict with protective measures.},

It requires the negotiation of competing technological frames across multiple knowledge domains. Three major challenges hinder effective innovation: (i) a mismatch between goal-driven IS design methods and the need for cross-functional knowledge-sharing, (ii) the distributed and partial knowledge possessed by stakeholders from diverse groups; (iii) the need to maintain interpretive flexibility across cycles of discovery and analysis. This paper develops an analytical framework for integrating knowledge frames across stakeholder groups, to provide a common language for the co- design of business and IT systems.},

abstract = {The paper expands theoretical and empirical understanding of the interaction between formal boundary spanning mechanism (i.e. individuals formally nominated to span boundaries for knowledge sharing) and informal boundary spanning mechanism (i.e., informal seeking of information via social ties crossing boundaries) in a far-flung operation of a global company. Through a case study of engineering groups at a U.S. based manufacturing plant, we found that both formal and informal boundary spanning mechanisms had a positive effect on the ability of dispersed groups to identify and transfer remotely situated knowledge from other sites. However, we also found that the formal boundary spanning mechanism may have a suppressing effect on the informal boundary spanning mechanism when jointly pursued in certain circumstances. The findings call into question the implicit view of the boundary spanner and virtual team literatures that has largely portrayed the effects of both mechanisms on cross-boundary knowledge transfer as independent or complementary.},

abstract = {Knowledge management has emerged as a field blending a systems approach with methods drawn from organizational management and learning. In contrast, knowledge representation, a branch of artificial intelligence, is grounded in formal methods. Research in the separate behavioral and the structural disciplines - knowledge management and knowledge engineering - have not traditionally cross-pollinated, preventing the development of many practical uses. Organization managers lack guidance in where to direct improvement efforts targeted at specific groups of knowledge workers. Demonstrated here is Knowledge Improvement Measurement System, an optimization solution that employs marginal utility theory in a metric space, and formal reasoning via software agents realized in conceptual graphs. This allows for repeated evaluation of knowledge improvement measurements. The KIMS method can measure activities that organize and encourage knowledge sharing to achieve competitive advantage. The solution takes into account the body of knowledge related to human understanding and learning, and formal methods of knowledge organization.},

abstract = {The problem of sharing data in peer-to-peer environment has received considerable attention in recent years. However, knowledge sharing in peer architectures has received very little attention. This paper proposes a framework for query reformulation in peer architectures. We first consider a mapping language based on a particular description logic that includes class connectors. Then a set of rules are proposed for building graphs. Because the axioms in a knowledge base have different properties, our graph generation algorithm classifies the generated graphs into four sets (Ugraph, Bgraph, Cgraph and Dgraph). Furthermore, based on the properties of the unification nodes, our algorithms can reformulate each kind of atom in a special way. Finally we do extensive simulation experiments and simulation results show that the proposed method has better performance than those of Mork's [8].},

abstract = {Managers of information systems face a knowledge crisis as they operate in increasingly heterogeneous, hostile, expertise-poor environments. This problem is compounded for small organizations. This paper presents results from field research on the feasibility of fostering cross-organizational knowledge sharing in order to expand access to expertise for pernicious problems while minimizing the loss of context, such as situational and environmental factors, that impacts the usefulness of solutions. This essentially creates a virtual, cross-organizational helpdesk.In order to understand the utility of such a system we explore how employees' satisfaction with helpdesk articles changes as the source of the articles moves further away from local creation to generic solutions. Our findings suggest that procedurally-based information available within major Internet repositories tends to be the most highly relevant and valued within organizations. However, when no documentation is available from manufacturers, information contributed by partner sites is more effective than those solely developed in-house. This paper suggests strategies for reusing information to impact work within small organizations.},

The system, "Squidz", automatically classifies browsed web pages against an ontology, and allows users to share comments made about those pages to members of a community. As the user browses web pages, recommendations of relevant documents which have already been shared are produced, based upon both the user's social network as well as the semantic content of the page currently in view. Key to the design of the system has been the requirement, evidenced by earlier studies, that sharing should be easily effected as a side-effect of browsing rather than comprising a separate and distracting task. Another feature of the system is the linkage of a formal ontology with user-provided tags of shared information, thus combining the proven popularity of folksonomy-based systems with the shared and formal domain model provided by an ontology.},

With further increase in digitalization of mathematics the situation will get worse without significant advances.When searching a formula, we often want to find not only structurally identical occurrences, but also all (logically) equivalent ones. Furthermore, we want to retrieve whole mathematical theories (i.e. objects with prescribed properties), and we want to find them irrespective of the nomenclature chosen in the respective formalization.In this paper, we propose a normalization-based approach to mathematical formula and theory retrieval modulo an equivalence theory and concept renaming, and apply the proposed algorithm to end-user querying and knowledge sharing. We test the implementation by applying it to a first-order translation of the Mizar library.},

Standardized infrastructure for information or knowledge sharing is required to make autonomous agents interdependent on each other for effective collaboration in a multi-agent system. In order to enhance productivity of knowledge workers knowledge management tools should support collaborative environments among desktop, web, and even mobile devices. The Semantic Web is the place where software agents perform various intelligent tasks using standard knowledge representational schemes that are named "ontologies." This paper presents a conceptual framework of the social knowledge activities and knowledge processes with regard to the social software agents. Our prototype, called WANT, is a wiki-based semantic tagging system for collaborative and communicative knowledge creation and maintenance by a human or software agent. It can be supported in both desktop and mobile environments.},

Key applications include service discovery and selection, and knowledge sharing. This use of referrals is inspired by human interactions, where referrals are a key basis for judging the trustworthiness of a given service.The use of referrals enable an agent to control how its request is processed, it also provides an architectural basis for four kinds of interaction policies. InterPol is a language and framework supporting such policies. InterPol has been implemented using a Datalog-based policy engine for each agent. It has been applied on scenarios from a (multinational) health care project. The contribution of this paper is in a general referrals-based framework for privacy and trust management, which is shown to effectively capture a variety of privacy and trust requirements of autonomous users.},

abstract = {Recently, quite a few researches upon context-awareness, ubiquitous computing and automatic surveillance have emerged. Their objectives are to appropriately react to current context situation over the web, rather than in a single machine. This requires exchanging the context of extremely dynamic web environment, as well as reasoning about the context to achieve goal. Thus, context representation and context reasoning play significant roles. This paper presents an ontology-based approach to: 1) employing web ontology language (OWL) to describe context knowledge, and 2) using semantic web rule language (SWRL) to represent rule-based inference rules for context reasoning. OWL describes context knowledge in details by defining relationships among knowledge. As an XML-based language, OWL enjoys good interoperability for knowledge sharing and reuse over the web. Further, SWRL represents rule-based first-order logic (FOL) inference rules, which are expressed in terms of predefined OWL taxonomic context knowledge. By doing so, SWRL rules perfectly integrate with OWL, making it easy to develop and maintain application systems. Besides, as SWRL is also XML-based, it is not so dependent upon inference engine. That is, inference engine can be changed without rewriting the rules for engine-specific syntax. This enhances system maintainability.},

Improved mechanisms for interpreting the terms used to describe knowledge across system boundaries are proposed and tested. The method is also capable of handling complex product designs and realistic manufacturing scenarios involving several parties. This is achieved using an agent-architecture to simulate the effects of individual manufacturing facilities (e.g. machine tools and foundries) on product features. It is hypothesised that knowledge sharing between such agents can be enhanced by integrating common product and manufacturing information models with a shared ontology, and that the shared ontology can be based largely on The Process Specification Language (PSL).},

It reveals that an informal knowledge authoring tool such as MASE is used for sharing content for problem understanding, instrumental, projective, social, expertise location, and content navigation purposes. We also observe self-organized maintenance of the repository content among the ordinary repository users as a result of the open-edit nature of the Wiki-based repository.},

The useful features included a blog for small and informal announcements, introducing new researchers with the subject and recommending resources to other researchers.

Antipattern OWL ontologies can be used to build a dynamic antipattern knowledge base, which can up- date itself automatically. This will allow the accessibility and transferability of up-to-date computer-mediated soft- ware project management knowledge to software project managers by encoding antipatterns into computer under- standable ontologies.

abstract = {The method of finding high-quality answers has significant impact on user satisfaction in community question answering systems. However, due to the lexical gap between questions and answers as well as spam typically existing in user-generated content, filtering and ranking answers is very challenging. Previous solutions mainly focus on generating redundant features, or finding textual clues using machine learning techniques; none of them ever consider questions and their answers as relational data but instead model them as independent information. Moreover, they only consider the answers of the current question, and ignore any previous knowledge that would be helpful to bridge the lexical and semantic gap. We assume that answers are connected to their questions with various types of latent links, i.e. positive indicating high-quality answers, negative links indicating incorrect answers or user-generated spam, and propose an analogical reasoning-based approach which measures the analogy between the new question-answer linkages and those of relevant knowledge which contains only positive links; the candidate answer which has the most analogous link is assumed to be the best answer. We conducted experiments based on 29.8 million Yahoo!Answer question-answer threads and showed the effectiveness of our approach.},

The overhead of consistency management of replicated data can be tamed by built-in DBMS functionality. Different kinds of applications, e.g., update-intensive online transaction processing, cyclical updates for data warehousing, knowledge sharing of repository data, and so on, have different requirements for the availability, up-to-dateness and consistency of replicated data. Thus, replication strategies should be adaptable to the specific requirements of diverse enterprise applications. We describe a middleware for enterprise-wide data replication. It maintains meta data for several protocols, so that the replication strategy can be adapted on the fly to the actual needs of an application.},

abstract = {One of the possibilities for improving decision processes, and the knowledge management across interacting organizations is to explore successful past experiences. Case-based reasoning (CBR) is a problem solving strategy which is based on the reuse of past solutions (cases) to address new problems. Ontologies are a means to facilitate sharing and reuse of bodies of knowledge across organizations and applications on the basis of a well-defined and precise semantics for concepts and terms. This work presents a proposal aimed at knowledge reuse, during the decision activities by means of interwoven concepts from the knowledge management, CBR and ontologies research. This blended approach presents an ontological case construction for CBR systems as theoretical and empirical support for knowledge sharing. We obtain a formal characterization of a case by means of an ontological description of particular cases, and their interrelationships with cases stored in different case-repositories. An architecture for a distributed CBR system is proposed on the basis of a multiagent setting for semantic-based access to knowledge.},

CSCL targets the development of problem-solving skills by means of a collaborative process of knowledge construction. Unfortunately most recent e-Learning systems lack of the fundamental characteristics that guarantee knowledge sharing such as accessibility, interoperability, durability and reusability. In this paper, we propose the use of the Shareable Courseware Object Reference Model (SCORM) as the technological foundation for a CSCL environment based on the scientific method. The contribution of this work is on showing the design of a web-based learning system that promotes the use of the scientific method as a general methodology for problem-solving by helping the participants to find, import, share, reuse, and export learning content in a standardized way.},

We apply item-based similarity computation in a CF framework to retrieve N information objects based on the user's interests and recommended by peer.

abstract = {Incident analysis is an important activity to maintain the safety of nuclear power plants. Much discussion is required to utilize the collected incidents effectively in the incident analysis activity. On-line Computer Mediated Communication(CMC) activity is an appropriate circumstance for geographically dispersed workers in nuclear power plants to discuss about the incident analysis. Some studies, however, indicate that the discussion activity in CMC tends to stagnate after a short period of time. For this study, the authors developed a discussion system for knowledge sharing and collaborative analysis of incidents, and proposed a method to promote discussion among users through introduction of "Active Participant". The Active Participant always behaves actively, and such behaviors are expected to promote the other members' incident analysis in the discussion group. To evaluate the effectiveness of the introduction of the Active Participant and obtain concrete guidance of the Active Participant, an experiment was conducted with nuclear power plant workers who were asked to evaluate the discussion system. The results of the experiment show that Active Participant can promote discussion among group members if enough number of incidents are submitted to the discussion system.},

In a Witkey site, users offer a small award for a solution to a task, and other users compete to have their solution selected.In this paper, we examine the behavior of users on one of the biggest Witkey websites in China, Taskcn.com. On Taskcn, we observed several characteristics in users' activity over time. Most users become inactive after only a few submissions. Others keep attempting tasks. Over time, users tend to select tasks where they are competing against fewer opponents to increase their chances of winning. They will also, perhaps counterproductively, select tasks with higher expected rewards. Yet, on average, they do not increase their chances of winning, and in some categories of tasks, their chances actually decrease. This does not paint the full picture, however, because there is a very small core of successful users who manage not only to win multiple tasks, but to increase their win-to-submission ratio over time. This core group proposes nearly 20\% of the winning solutions on the site. The patterns we observe on Taskcn, we believe, hold clues to the future of crowdsourcing and freelance marketplaces, and raise interesting design implications for such sites.},

abstract = {After years of rapid growth, Q&amp;A websites, such as Yahoo Answers and Baidu Zhidao now start to utilize recommender systems to route questions to potential answerers. Traditional studies on question recommendation on Q&amp;A website usually presume that answerers are always instantly available for askers. They neglect the importance of timely response of answerers to question askers. Such negligence of time-efficiency leads to lower quality of recommender systems, namely the question starvation problem. In this paper, we focus on improving time-efficiency of recommendations on a large scale online Q&amp;A website in order to boost the answer ratio of new posted questions. To achieve this goal, we design an answerer recommender system (ARS) that is capable of instantly routing a new question the potential answerers with the right expertise. We test our system on a real-world large-scale Q&amp;A website. Experimental results demonstrate that compared with a previously used baseline system, in our system both the time-efficiency and the number of answers given to a question are dramatically improved. In addition, we find that timely response to questions can stimulate interactions between question askers and answerers. Such interaction can boost the answer acceptance ratio by askers since it encourages answerers to improve their answers actively and continuously.},

In this paper, a new mathematical model that caters to the special requirements of classification and argumentative reasoning techniques based on Indian philosophy has been described. The main focus of this model is the emphasis given to relation descriptions between concepts and the foundation of invariable connection between concepts/relations that is dictated by the philosophy.},

This paper reports on an experiment with a method of conceptual analysis to elicit, analyse and compare conceptual models used by individual researchers, with the ultimate aim to facilitate researchers in sharing these models. Using an open coding method, we analysed the papers of two researchers from an interdisciplinary research project. The resulting conceptual models were validated in semi-structured interviews. The method was found to be effective in eliciting concepts, also those used implicitly. The interviews also revealed certain mechanisms by which researchers adopt new concepts and choose words for strategic reasons. However, the analysis costs are high, while the benefits remain as of yet uncertain.},

In view of these, this paper will explore the role of trust in successful relationship management, and further in the ultimate IT outsourcing success. The paper will also contribute by categorizing trust into two levels--organizational level and individual level, and exploring especially the effects of interpersonal trust.

Querying the entity names in image search engines yields large candidate lists, but they often have low precision and unsatisfactory recall.Our goal is to populate a knowledge base with photos of named entities, with high precision, high recall, and diversity of photos for a given entity. We harness relational facts about entities for generating expanded queries to retrieve different candidate lists from image search engines. We use a weighted voting method to determine better rankings of an entity's photos. Appropriate weights are dependent on the type of entity (e.g., scientist vs. politician) and automatically computed from a small set of training entities. We also exploit visual similarity measures based on SIFT features, for higher diversity in the final rankings. Our experiments with photos of persons and landmarks show significant improvements of ranking measures like MAP and NDCG, and also for diversity-aware ranking.},

Key needs addressed by the introduced multi-agent system refer to interoperation among distributed resources and knowledge sharing, reuse and integration. An ontology library creates a common shared understanding of the domain for interoperating agents. The proposed system employs agents for information storage and retrieval, for enhancing collaboration within a distributed design environment and for providing a suitable interface to the user. The agents offer content-related support to the user by committing to the same library of ontologies. The proposed multi-agent design information management system aims to facilitate the optimization of the solution space of the collective dispersed design team.},

abstract = {Networked Cyber-Physical Systems (NCPS) present many challenges that are not suitably addressed by existing distributed computing paradigms. They must be reactive and maintain an overall situation awareness that emerges from partial distributed knowledge. They must achieve system goals through local, asynchronous actions, using (distributed) control loops through which the environment provides essential feedback. Typical NCPS are open, dynamic, and heterogeneous in many dimensions, and often need to be rapidly instantiated and deployed for a given mission. To address these challenges, we pursue a declarative approach to provide an abstraction from the high complexity of NCPS and avoid error-prone and time-consuming low-level programming. A longer-term goal is to develop a distributed computational and logical foundation that supports a wide spectrum of system operation between autonomy and cooperation to adapt to resource constraints, in particular to limitations of computational, energy, and networking resources. Here, we present first steps toward a logical framework for NCPS that combines distributed reasoning and asynchronous control in space and time. The logical framework is based on partially ordered knowledge sharing, a distributed computing paradigm for loosely coupled systems that does not require continuous network connectivity. We illustrate our approach with a simulation prototype of our logical framework in the context of networked mobile robot teams that operate in an abstract instrumented cyber-physical space with sensors.},

In such a scenario, software agents provide a realistic solution. The agent-based prototype has been developed that involves a knowledge component called an Intelligent Pediatric Assistant (IPA); and User Agents (UA) along with their Graphical User Interfaces (GUI). The GUI of UA provides the interface to the healthcare practitioner for submitting sign-symptoms and displaying the expert opinion as suggested by IPA. Depending upon the observations, the IPA decides the diagnosis and the treatment plan. The UA and IPA form client-server architecture for knowledge sharing.},

abstract = {Standardized infrastructure for information or knowledge sharing is required to make autonomous agents interdependent on each other for effective collaboration in a multi-agent system. Folksonomy has become very popular as an enabling technology to provide a common conceptualization of the data that agent systems use. However, there are problems on free-form tagging in folksonomy. Folksonomy is only concerned with a group of instances which are labeled with tags without a formal definition. No available tool provides a way to contextualize folksonomies with respect to users, communities, goals, tasks, and so on. There is no formal approach to classifying and sharing tags that reflect a user's mental model of information resources in terms of folksonomy. We present a novel approach to developing an agent environment for contextualizing folksonomies in a triadic context using Formal Concept Analysis. We conducted an experiment to build concept hieracrhies and contextualize folksonomies from tags of blogosphere.},

We propose a user driven, ontology-based overlay architecture to enable Communities of Interest (CoI) for structured resource access and knowledge sharing between users of similar interests. In this paper, we describe the overlay network architecture to support the basic functionalities of a CoI. The basic tenet of this architecture is the use of ontologies to represent objects in order to enable semantic resource discovery and retrieval which reflect the interest of the user within a specific community. Three advertising and retrieval schemes, namely aggressive, crawler-based and minimum-cover-rule, are discussed and investigated using an emulation-based experimental framework. The results show that the minimum-cover-rule scheme exhibits higher performance than the other two schemes.},

This service aspires to fulfill the above re- quirements featuring a Peer-to-Peer architecture and Dis- tributed Hash Tables (DHTs) to achieve robustness through redundancy and scalability through decentralization. Re- sources are discovered using a set of attribute-value pairs. A straightforward DHT-based approach that creates a dis- tributed inverted index suffers from a linear increase of mes- sages and replicas with the number of attributes. We try to reduce this number by proposing an efficient multi-attribute routing algorithm. We emulate and test our implementation on the DAS-2 distributed supercomputer.},

How is knowledge about money, debt and personal finance represented in novices and experts; and if and how do ideas about debt and money influence decisions on household finance? The study aims to obtain insight in these questions by investigating novices and experts on 4 cognitive aspects: representations, decisions making, knowledge and communication on finance.Research approach -- A number of studies and experiments will be carried out in for this doctoral thesis. The first study is planned for August 2012. Two groups of subjects, consumers of financial products (novices) and financial professionals (experts) will participate in a study using the Teach back method. This is a qualitative method to research mental representations of complex systems. Using the Teach back method, it will be analyzed if there is consistency in representations within both groups and differences between both groups will be investigated. The results of the study will be used for creating two or more personas. Personas are models of people. Using personas several experiments will be designed. These experiments will involve methods to create a common ground for finance concepts for novices and experts. One experiment will be the design of a workshop where groups of participants share knowledge on money and finance. A second experiment will be an online platform that supports knowledge sharing between novices and experts.},

These business ontologies enable users and developers to form agreements about system specification by using the ontologies to address three aspects of business application for local governments: legal aspects, business processes, and software design. Our method specifically examines construction of domain models based on business ontologies of the early stage of development to reduce the cost of describing specifications. To recover the completeness of specifications, we propose a Web process architecture, which enables us to transfer a domain model to a design system specification. We have implemented a full environment using JAVA language, which enables us to generate software systems from a set of work processes.},

abstract = {Yahoo Answers (YA) is a large and diverse question-answer forum, acting not only as a medium for sharing technical knowledge, but as a place where one can seek advice, gather opinions, and satisfy one's curiosity about a countless number of things. In this paper, we seek to understand YA's knowledge sharing and activity. We analyze the forum categories and cluster them according to content characteristics and patterns of interaction among the users. While interactions in some categories resemble expertise sharing forums, others incorporate discussion, everyday advice, and support. With such a diversity of categories in which one can participate, we find that some users focus narrowly on specific topics, while others participate across categories. This not only allows us to map related categories, but to characterize the entropy of the users' interests. We find that lower entropy correlates with receiving higher answer ratings, but only for categories where factual expertise is primarily sought after. We combine both user attributes and answer characteristics to predict, within a given category, whether a particular answer will be chosen as the best answer by the asker.},

In CAMPS, a formal context model, which combines First Order Probabilistic Logic with OWL ontologies, has been investigated to facilitate context modeling and reasoning about imperfect and ambiguous contextual information and to enable context knowledge sharing and reuse. A context inference mechanism based on an extended Bayesian Network approach has been studied to enable automated reactive and deductive reasoning.

Responding to an emergency often requires organizational and inter-organizational processes and complex operating procedures to be followed. We focus on the sharing of data associated with events of interest to collaborating organizations. Condition-action-alternative-action rules, logic/derivation rules, and constraint rules are used to define organizational and inter-organizational policies, regulations, and data and security constraints. Structures of these heterogeneous rules are used to capture organizational and inter-organizational processes and operating procedures. In this demonstration, operational procedures developed by collaborating organizations in USDA's National Plant Diagnostics Network (NPDN) will be used to show the knowledge definition facilities and the distributed event-triggered knowledge sharing strategy.},

abstract = {The competitive advantage of organizations is more and more related to the competence of the workers and to the capacity the organization shows in improving the organizational learning. Computer-supported learning (CSL) contributes to improve the organizational learning by supporting the knowledge sharing process. Sharing knowledge, however, is not sufficient to increase the intellectual capital of an organization. It is necessary to share the kind of knowledge that can be useful to add value to the organization business. This kind of knowledge can be identified and mapped by applying knowledge management (KM) processes. However, although positive effects of a comprehensive approach that addresses both CSL (formal learning) and KM (informal learning) could seem obvious, and despite the fact that organizations are starting to perceive the interrelations among CSL and KM, these integrations ideas are rarely implemented in practice and, in many cases, are not technologically operational. This paper fills in this gap by discussing how CSL can be useful for satisfying the requirements of KM.},

By incorporating the Web portal with a knowledge-based system, knowledge acquisition and sharing will be more efficient. This type of knowledge system is known as knowledge sharing system rather than expert system. Existing SIG portals provide the information by listing the names of the related people in a textual form. Some Web portals reveal the level of expertise of the members but the textual representation does not manage to highlight the different level of expertise among the community explicitly. Thus we have proposed KM-ClaVis approach that consists of a point-based semi automatic classification method to classify the users' expertise levels and the tree view method to visualize the classified expertise of a software engineering interest group (SEIG) e-community. We apply KM-ClaVis approach in an existing SEIG knowledge portal. We anticipate the proposed approach will improve knowledge management among the members.},

Recently the rate of scientific knowledge production is overwhelming the ability for researchers to process it. Semantic web technologies may help to handle this vast amount of scientific knowledge. However, automatic computerized techniques that extract semantics from natural language text for use in matching with the requests of knowledge seekers achieve only mediocre results. Clearly, semantic descriptions of expert knowledge that are constructed by the knowledge creators themselves will be more accurate. We report an approach and software implementation of a knowledge sharing platform based on semantic web technologies, called EKOSS for expert knowledge ontology-based semantic search, that helps knowledge creators construct semantic descriptions of their knowledge. The EKOSS system enables knowledge creators to construct computer-interpretable semantically rich statements describing their knowledge with minimal effort and without any knowledge of semantic web technologies.},

We explore both the opportunities -- new local knowledge, and concerns -- privacy risks, raised by this implicit information sharing. We conduct two empirical studies: subjects create place data when using PlaceMail, a location-based reminder system, and elect whether to share it on Sharescape, a community map-building system. We contribute by: (1) showing location-based reminders yield new local knowledge about a variety of places, (2) identifying heuristics people use when deciding what place-related information to share (and their prevalence), (3) detailing how these decision heuristics can inform local knowledge sharing system design, and (4) identifying new uses of shared place information, notably opportunistic errand planning.},

Knowledge gained in the course of a simulation project quite often remains in the heads of the people involved in the project. It is not sufficiently externalized because documentation tasks are time-consuming, seen as an add-on to the real problem-solving process and poorly supported. As a result, project-specific knowledge about assumptions, decisions, modeling philosophy, implementation, experiments and results is not kept but lost, even if it is retained by the people involved. As a contribution to overcoming this problem, logistics simulation knowledge is identified and processes of knowledge sharing, creation and acquisition in the course of a logistics simulation project are analyzed. Although closely related to logistics and supply chain simulation, the methods proposed are easily adapted to other application areas of modeling and simulation -- and should be applied to them as well.},

This research framework is operationalized through the use of Soft Systems Methodology.

Based on the approach, we developed a system called Business Stakeholder Analyzer to perform automatic classification of stakeholder types. Experimental results showed that, compared with humans, the system achieved better within-class accuracies in widespread stakeholder types such as "partner/sponsor/supplier" and "media/reviewer." It was more efficient than human classification. The encouraging findings suggest a promising future of our approach to facilitating knowledge sharing in collaborative commerce.},

There are many knowledge management systems built for large corporate companies. However, not many open source systems are available for small research communities. Currently, wiki has not only changed the conception of building knowledge in an on-going process, but also become a popular tool of sharing knowledge worldwide. In this paper, we adopt wiki tools, Tiddly-Wiki and Media-Wiki, to build two useful platforms as knowledge management systems for small research groups less than twenty members. Furthermore, we also provide integration service via the Update Server, which supports knowledge update, coherence editing, and knowledge sharing in order to satisfy the requirements of personal and group research. Our prototype intends to help students quickly grasp the expertise of their specific domain knowledge as new comers and become experienced researchers after graduation. We try to make this project as a continuous effort to accumulate more useful knowledge in a collaborative manner as required by the researchers.},

Knowledge can be classified as tacit (i.e., "knowing-how") and explicit (i.e., "knowing-what"). A gap exists in knowledge management research in that research has been dominated by an information technology perspective and tends to focus on explicit knowledge. This study seeks to address this gap by focusing on tacit knowledge management using tenets from cooperative learning theory. The research proposes that the sharing of tacit knowledge is made up of related sub-activities, and seeks more clarity in understanding autonomy, an antecedent that drives these activities. Furthermore, the research attempts to uncover the relationships between the tacit knowledge sharing sub-activities and the work outcomes produced by the knowledge work.},

abstract = {Micro logging is emerging as a suitable means for question-answering in working settings. This leads to different efforts to seamlessly integrate microblogging into the daily-used tools. Specifically, microblogging is being regarded as particularly useful during software development, akin to the tradition of Q&amp;A forums. This paper looks at a particular kind of software: the one being developed by domain experts through the use of Domain Specific Languages (DSLs). We believe this setting is specially amenable to benefit from Q&amp;A microblogging due to inherent limitations of the target audience. This brings the twist of domain specific ness into microblogging, i.e. the Q&amp;A process is now framed by the semantics of the DSL constructs. This permits the introduction of editing assistants that embed domain knowledge about the kind of questions that can be posed, and the way answers can be selected. This opens an opportunity for more focused and assisted microblogging. This paper introduces Crowd Call, an in place microblogging mediator for DSL editors. The aim is to make microblogging a natural gesture during the conception of the DSL expressions, making transparent the interplay between the DSL editor and the Social Networking Services. In addition, Crowd Call can be configured to the constructs and resolution strategies of the DSL at hand so that questions and answers are framed by the semantics of the DSL. The approach is illustrated for three DSLs: the Google Spreadsheets formula language, SQL and Sticklet. We show how Crowd Call-mediated microblogging is tuned for the semantics of each DSL.},

abstract = {The advances in information technology largely influence our life style in various aspects. The changes in the underlying economics, information technology, business processes and organizations are affecting the very character of war and are leading to the fundamental shift from platform-centric warfare to network centric warfare (NCW), also known as network centric operation (NCO) [1]. Since its emergence in 1983 [10], the debate between proponents and opponents is hotly continuous. The proponents suggest that networked entities may produce information superiority, which in turn dramatically increases combat power. The theory that power is increasingly derived from information sharing, knowledge sharing and command speeding up has been supported by results of recent military operational experience [4]. The advantages of NCW have been recognized as:Small-size networked forces can perform missions effectively at a lower cost;},

abstract = {Conventional top-down driven technology management approaches have reached their limits when quick technology identification and broad technology portfolios are needed. This paper presents a more flexible bottom-up driven technology portfolio management method, the so-called Technology Breeding. Experts are encouraged to build communities of practice for the technologies they identify as relevant for future business. Through natural selection, based on the resources the community can bind within the company's breeding environment, it comes to a growth of the fittest. Technologies that do not attract enough interest are kept latently in the environment, waiting for their chance. The implementation of this method is currently being researched at a R&amp;D division of Siemens AG Austria, having 6.200 engineers.The technology breeding method is also a driving force for cultural changes towards knowledge sharing, cooperation across borders of business units and countries, and opening top-down bottlenecks.},

abstract = {In general, document classification research focuses on the automated placement of unseen documents into pre-defined categories. This is regarded as one core technical component of knowledge management systems, because it can support to handle explicit knowledge more systematically and improve knowledge sharing among the users. Document classification in knowledge management systems should support incremental knowledge acquisition and maintenance because of the dynamic knowledge changes involved. We propose the MCRDR document classifier as an incremental and maintainable document classification solution. Even though our system successfully supported personal level document classification, we did not examine its capability as a document classification tool in multi-user based knowledge management contexts. This paper focuses on the analysis of document classification results performed by multiple users. Our analysis reveals that even though the same documents and the classification structure are given to the users, they have very different document classification patterns and different acceptance results for each other's classification results. Furthermore, our results show that the integration of multiple users' classification may improve document classification performance in the knowledge management context.},

abstract = {Software Agents can conveniently facilitate knowledge discovery and knowledge sharing across an organisation. We contend that programming tasks are often mimicked, that knowledge concerning reusable libraries can be extracted automatically from source code repositories, and that this knowledge can then be filtered and presented to a developer in a manner that will encourage and support future software reuse. We describe RASCAL, a recommender agent that continually recommends a set of task-relevant library methods to a developer. RASCAL learns information regarding how a particular reusable library is used and then employs this insight to make task-relevant recommendations to a developer. In this paper we detail our RASCAL agent and compare two recommendation techniques, namely Memory-Based and Model-Based Collaborative Filtering. We are interested in producing a scalable and efficient real-time recommender and thus ideally would favour a Model-Based approach. However, each scheme is evaluated against both runtime performance and recommendation accuracy. We present results and discuss the merits and limitations of each technique.},

abstract = {This paper describes a system developed to help people explore local communities by providing navigation services in social spaces created by members of the communities. Just as a community's social space is formed by communication and knowledge-sharing practices, the proposed system utilizes data of the corresponding social network to reconstruct the social space, which is otherwise not physically perceptible but imaginary and yet experiential and learnable. The social space is modeled with an agent network, where each agent stands for a member of the community and has knowledge about expertise and personal characteristics of other members. An agent can gather information, using its social "connections," to find community members most suitable to communicate to in a specific situation defined by the system's user. The system then deploys its multimodal interface, which operates with 3D graphics and haptic virtual environments and "maps" the social space onto a representation of the relevant physical space, to advise the user on an efficient communication strategy for the given community. A prototype of the system is built and used in a pilot study. The study results are briefly discussed, conclusions are drawn, and implications for future work are formulated.},

The main aim of this PhD Programme is to research, discuss and generate new knowledge about learning as a key element in the Knowledge Society, including both Social Sciences studies and recent technological advances, but taking a synergetic and symbiotic approach. In line with this approach a number of research lines have been established. These are open to extension, but always with a collaborative orientation, and they include:•Educational Assessment and Guidance.•Human-Computer Interaction.•eLearning.•Computers in Education.•Communication Media and Education.•Medicine and Education.•Robotics in Education.•Engineering and Education.•Information Society and Education.The PhD Programme offers a framework for facilitating synergies and symbiotic relationships between the different knowledge areas with the goal of enhancing Education as an essential right and the real engine of society today. At the same time, bridges are built which enable us to face the current pressing challenges to human progress in a reflective, collaborative and interdisciplinary way, the most relevant challenges related to the Mankind progress.Together with the PhD Programme, a new Conference is born, TEEM (Technological Ecosystems for Enhancing Multiculturality). The Conference aims and key research lines are shared with the PhD Programme, while promoting internationalization and knowledge sharing with all researchers working on these topics. The conference itself also seeks to be innovative. The TEEM Steering Committee does not want this event be simply another traditional conference in which participants present their works and return home without interacting with their peers. Consequently TEEM is divided in thematic and highly cohesive tracks. Each track shares the scientific and formal aspects for paper submissions, peer reviews and publication, but the track chairs will organize the appropriate dynamics to achieve the most important goal: the creation of a research community.},

When does effective discourse help a collective outperform individuals? What functions should the next generation of social platforms support?

However, it is still a complex and time-consuming task due to lack of appropriate infrastructure or middleware-level support. In this paper, we first propose a formal context-model based on ontology using OWL to realize semantic context representation, context reasoning and knowledge sharing, context classification and so on. Our context model captures various contexts by introducing a classification scheme; captures relationships between different context information by introducing dependency tag to the property associated with a specified context class; captures quality of context by annotating sensed context with extensible quality constraints. It also supports the use of different context reasoning engines to reason about various contexts so that applications can be given a notion of the confidence of different contexts before acting on it. And then, based on the context model, an architecture for building of context-aware services is presented.},

abstract = {The proliferation of knowledge-sharing communities like Wikipedia and the advances in automatic information extraction from semistructured and textual Web data have enabled the construction of very large knowledge bases. These knowledge collections contain facts about many millions of entities and relationships between them, and can be conveniently represented in the RDF data model. Prominent examples are DBpedia, YAGO, Freebase, Trueknowledge, and others.These structured knowledge collections can be viewed as “Semantic Wikipedia Databases”, and they can answer many advanced questions by SPARQL-like query languages and appropriate ranking models. In addition, the knowledge bases can boost the semantic capabilities and precision of entity-oriented Web search, and they are enablers for value-added knowledge services and applications in enterprises and online communities.The talk discusses recent advances in the large-scale harvesting of entity-relationship facts from Web sources, and it points out the next frontiers in building comprehensive knowledge bases and enabling semantic search services. In particular, it discusses the benefits and problems in extending the prior work along the following dimensions: temporal knowledge to capture the time-context and evolution of facts, multilingual knowledge to interconnect the plurality of languages and cultures, and multimodal knowledge to include also photo and video footage of entities. All these dimensions pose grand challenges for robustness and scalability of knowledge harvesting.},

The traditional methods of knowledge representation lack explicit expressions for knowledge sharing. This paper presents a framework of functional knowledge based on ontology which can provide a good inference mechanism, in order to represent knowledge formally and explicitly in the conceptual design. The framework consists of three-level ontology constrained by semantic and syntax. In addition, a function structure meta-model (FSFM, Function-Solution-Findings-Model) is proposed for the innovative design in the conceptual design phase according to the knowledge framework. The knowledge ontology layers are defined in the meta-model and their relationship in the meta-model is discussed as well. Ontology modeling language OWL is applied to describe function ontology. Finally, an example is proposed to illustrate the process of the solving model.},

It has been argued that current P2P systems suffer from the lack of semantics. Therefore combining P2P solutions with Semantic Web technologies for knowledge sharing become a new trend. SemreX is a P2P based semantic-enabled knowledge management system for sharing references metadata. In SemreX, we need to handle heterogeneous literature formats, and present a shared understanding about publications knowledge. Meanwhile, peers in SemreX require some compromises with respect to the use of semantic knowledge models for self-description. In this paper, we propose metadata models that combine features of ontology, for encoding and aligning semantic information from references, and for a flexible description of knowledge located in a peer. We describe these models and discuss the roles of the models in the SemreX environment as well as their creations and applications.},

abstract = {When one joins an existing community, she or he may have little-to-no knowledge of what other members already know. "Traditional" and electronic media are useful to collect information, but when the request is related to social experience, it is hard to locate and extract social knowledge from essentially subjective individual accounts. Asking somebody would then be a better way to search information, but it has disadvantages, too: the practicable area of potential contacts is limited by the range of one's personal network, the contacted individuals' knowledge, time limitations, etc. Communication on a personal basis in a new community is always trial-and-error driven, and it does not guarantee obtaining the information of interest even when such information is freely available from some of the community members. As a result of this, newcomers usually experience significant difficulties in adaptation to the community. In an attempt to help overcome this problem, the presented study proposes a system to assist personalized knowledge sharing. The system allows the user to navigate a social space of a community and to locate members who would address the user's needs.},

This framework may support critical security expert activities with respect to security requirements identification and selection of certain controls and countermeasures. In addition, we present a structured approach for establishing a security management framework and identify its critical parts.

In order to do this, they need to get the right questions to the right people to answer them, but also the existing answers to people who are interested in them. In order to accomplish this, they need to build a complex ecosystem where issues such as content quality, engagement, demand, interests, or reputation are taken into account. It is not possible to build a system like this unless most of the process are highly automated and scalable. The good news is that using high-quality data you can build machine learning solutions that can help address all of the previous requirements.In this talk I will describe some interesting uses of machine learning for Q&amp;A that range from different recommendation approaches such as personalized ranking to classifiers built to detect duplicate questions or spam. I will describe some of the modeling and feature engineering approaches that go into building these systems. I will also share some of the challenges faced when building such a large-scale knowledge base of human-generated knowledge. Finally, I will describe some of the unresolved research challenges in the Q&amp;A Space.I will use my experience at Quora as the main driving example. Quora is a Q&amp;A site that despite having over 80 million unique visitors a month, it is known for keeping a high-quality of answers and content in general.},
