abstract = {Knowledge management (KM) literature identifies numerous barriers that inhibit employees' knowledge sharing practices. Presently, there is a research gap that examines what factors promote such barriers and their direct impact on knowledge seeking and knowledge contributing behaviors via information and communication technologies (ICTs). To bridge the gap, a content analysis study of 104 KM articles identified three contributors to common KM barriers. A proposed causal model based on the contributors was tested using structural equation modeling technique on the responses collected from 314 ICT users. The results demonstrate that role conflict, role ambiguity, and locus of control predicted knowledge seeking and knowledge contributing behaviors via ICTs.},

publisher = {IEEE Press},
abstract = {Code review is an important task in software development. However, performing code review is perceived, for the most part, as an undesired task, presenting several challenges to the required collaboration and knowledge transfer between programmers and reviewers. In order to overcome these challenges and improve the effectiveness of code review, we developed SCRUT: Social Code Review Unifying Tool. By recruiting relevant cognitive theories and implementing gamification elements to motivate collaboration and knowledge sharing between programmers and reviewers, we plan to enhance the task of code review. This paper presents our vision for enhancing software engineering via gamification, and the theoretical cognitive foundation on which this vision is based, starting with the example of code review.},

abstract = {Effective knowledge sharing among members has rapidly become a competitive necessity for organizations. Thus it is essential for organizations to take steps to increase members' willingness to share knowledge, leading to desirable knowledge sharing behaviors. This study explores possible factors affecting users' intention to share knowledge in the context of system analysis. In addition to innovative climate, system analyst and user's interaction involvement, which is viewed as an important interpersonal communication competence, is proposed and further investigated, taking into consideration the links between innovative climate, interaction involvement and user intention to share knowledge. Based on data collected from 182 student analysts and 182 users, the results indicate that system analysts demonstrated higher levels of interaction involvement than users, where interaction involvement was measured by responsiveness, perceptiveness, and attentiveness. In addition, innovative climate positively and directly influences users' intention to share knowledge, while quite surprisingly, user's interaction involvement negatively affects his/her intention to share knowledge.},

abstract = {Organizations increasingly rely on teams to solve problems creatively or design new products and services. Research to date has mostly focused on individual creativity, rather than team creativity. This paper introduces the Team Creativity Model (TCM) to understand the antecedents of team creativity. TCM posits that both individual creativity and shared mental models (SMMs) contribute to team creativity. SMMs act as a mediator between knowledge sharing and team creativity. Antecedents to individual creativity include an individual's propensity to be creative and individual knowledge. Individual knowledge also is an antecedent to knowledge sharing, as are an individual's propensity to share knowledge and trust within the team. In an exploratory study at a telecom company, a team of design experts participating in four creative sessions provided initial support for the TCM constructs and their relationships. The findings suggest that further exploratory and empirical research on TCM is justified. Some tentative implications for research and practice are presented.},

abstract = {Deep learning has gained substantial popularity in recent years. Developers mainly rely on libraries and tools to add deep learning capabilities to their software. What kinds of bugs are frequently found in such software? What are the root causes of such bugs? What impacts do such bugs have? Which stages of deep learning pipeline are more bug prone? Are there any antipatterns? Understanding such characteristics of bugs in deep learning software has the potential to foster the development of better deep learning platforms, debugging mechanisms, development practices, and encourage the development of analysis and verification frameworks. Therefore, we study 2716 high-quality posts from Stack Overflow and 500 bug fix commits from Github about five popular deep learning libraries Caffe, Keras, Tensorflow, Theano, and Torch to understand the types of bugs, root causes of bugs, impacts of bugs, bug-prone stage of deep learning pipeline as well as whether there are some common antipatterns found in this buggy software. The key findings of our study include: data bug and logic bug are the most severe bug types in deep learning software appearing more than 48\% of the times, major root causes of these bugs are Incorrect Model Parameter (IPS) and Structural Inefficiency (SI) showing up more than 43\% of the times.We have also found that the bugs in the usage of deep learning libraries have some common antipatterns.},

Despite the importance of penetration testing in software security, practitioners search for strategies and guidance on how to get started in the domain of penetration testing. We hypothesize that practitioners have knowledge needs related to penetration testing, which can be synthesized using penetration testing-related questions posted on questions and answer (Q&amp;A) websites. A systematic investigation can identify the knowledge needs of practitioners related to penetration testing, helping the cyber-security community in advancing the field of cyber-security education. The goal of this paper is to help cyber-security researchers in advancing the field of cyber-security education by analyzing penetration testing-related questions posted by practitioners.},

Programmers often search for online code examples in Q&amp;A forums and read tutorials and blog posts to learn how to use a given API. However, there are often a massive number of related code examples and it is difficult for a user to understand the commonalities and variances among them, while being able to drill down to concrete details. We introduce an interactive visualization for exploring a large collection of code examples mined from open-source repositories at scale. This visualization summarizes hundreds of code examples in one synthetic code skeleton with statistical distributions for canonicalized statements and structures enclosing an API call. We implemented this interactive visualization for a set of Java APIs and found that, in a lab study, it helped users (1) answer significantly more API usage questions correctly and comprehensively and (2) explore how other programmers have used an unfamiliar API.},

An important and challenging task is to identify reliable and trusted experts on large popular CQA platforms. State-of-the-art graph-based approaches to expertise estimation consider only user-user interactions without taking the relative contribution of individual answers into account, while pairwise-comparison approaches consider only pairs involving the best-answerer of each question. This research argues that there is a need to account for the user's relative contribution towards solving the question when estimating user expertise and proposes a content-agnostic measure of user contributions. This addition is incorporated into a competition-based approach for ranking users' question answering ability. The paper analyses how improvements in user expertise estimation impact on applications in expert search and answer quality prediction. Experiments using the Yahoo! Chiebukuro data show encouraging performance improvements and robustness over state-of-the-art approaches.},

Outcomes from the natural language processing community have been adapted in software engineering research for leveraging this rich textual information; these include methods and readily available tools, often furnished with pre-trained models. State of the art pre-trained models however, capture general, common sense knowledge, with limited value when it comes to handling data specific to a specialized domain. There is currently a lack of domain-specific pre-trained models that would further enhance the processing of natural language artefacts related to software engineering. To this end, we release a word2vec model trained over 15GB of textual data from Stack Overflow posts. We illustrate how the model disambiguates polysemous words by interpreting them within their software engineering context. In addition, we present examples of fine-grained semantics captured by the model, that imply transferability of these results to diverse, targeted information retrieval tasks in software engineering and motivate for further reuse of the model.},

Our approach advocates involving micro-crowds (MCs), where in each micro-crowd, the population is relatively cohesive and familiar with each other. Using this approach, the evolving product is developed iteratively. At each iteration, a new MC can join the already established crowd to enhance the requirements for the next version, while adding terminology to an evolving folksonomy. We are currently using this approach in an on-going research project to develop an online social network (OSN) for academic researchers that will facilitate discussions and knowledge sharing around conferences.},

From this perspective, the broad use of online communities of practice (COPs) among teachers seems to be a common training model for in-service professional teachers. The utilization of communities of practice facilitates teachers' sharing of knowledge by creating opportunities for its members to interact and exchange good practices. The present study explores (a) the patterns of knowledge sharing amongst teachers in an official online community for PD purposes and (b) teachers' perceptions and motivation to participate in such online community. Data were collected through the analytics of the online community, in conjunction with questionnaires and interviews with community members. Results demonstrate that the most important motivation of teachers to participate in online community is the opportunity to share knowledge, ideas and successful practices. The paper discusses the potential training model through online communities of practice based on sharing of knowledge, aiming to contribute to PD research, shedding light to new challenges related to the PD of in-service teachers.},

abstract = {Software testing represents an important activity to achieve quality during mobile application development. The constant evolution of mobile applications in previous years relating to size and complexity entails the need to improve testing techniques and tools. In this context, developers/testers often resort to specialized communities or Question \&amp; Answer repositories to clarity doubts regarding testing in a practical and efficient way. Thus, these repositories become a popular source of data to understand the current context of software testing practices. In this paper, we present a study using the Stack Overflow repository for analyzing and clustering the main topics on Android testing. We employed the LDA algorithm to summarize the mobile testing related questions. Our findings show that topics such as testing tools, functional testing, and unit testing are often discussed when compared to other topics. We also analyzed the evolution of the interest of Android testing tools. Results show that developers are more interested in Appium, Espresso, Monkey, and Robotium tools.},

Drawing on Nevis, DiBella and Gould's [28] various organizational learning processes, we explore how knowledge creation, knowledge sharing, and knowledge application at the individual level impact their task related conceptual, contextual and operational knowledge. The model is empirically tested using structural equation modeling with data from a sample of knowledge workers in a wide variety of enterprises. Results suggest that conceptual knowledge is impacted by knowledge sharing and knowledge application. However, contextual knowledge is enhanced mainly by knowledge application. Greater conceptual and contextual knowledge contributes to better operational knowledge.},

abstract = {Q&amp;A communities are playing an important role in online knowledge sharing, where a large number of users with various knowledge background make tremendous contributions to solving many technical problems based on crowd intelligence. However, as new questions are increasingly posted, it is a non-trivial issue to find a matching answerer for each question. As a result, many questions fail to receive satisfying answers in time. This paper addresses the problem by predicting the best answerer for the new question. Many existing efforts are devoted to predicting the best answerer mainly by calculating the textual similarity between questions and a user’s historical post documents. Some works consider other features, such as the similarity of tags between questions and users, the average quality of a user’s historical answers, and so on. But few works consider interaction within the community. In recent years, works that take account of the interaction between community items (such as GCN and GAT) have made considerable progress in graph mining tasks like item recommendation, node representation, node classification, and link prediction. This kind of graph mining method can easily leverage interactive information in the community and encode it in an easy-to-use way which is very helpful for downstream tasks such as recommendation. However, questions that need to be recommended to answerers are new coming ones and with no interaction with any other node in the community yet. How to make reasonable use of collaborative information to improve recommendation performance is a real challenge. In this paper, we use the interactive information between candidate answerers and combine text information to make our best answerer recommendation. There are two main parts, LDA(Latent Dirichlet Allocation) topic model is used to capture the text information and graph attention networks (GATs) for interaction. We evaluated our approach on a real dataset from Stack Exchange. The result shows that our approach outperforms all the baseline methods.},

abstract = {Searching repositories of existing source code for code snippets is a key task in software engineering. Over the years, many approaches to this problem have been proposed. One recent tool called NCS, takes in a natural language query and outputs relevant code snippets, often being able to correctly answer Stack Overflow questions. But what happens when the developer doesn’t provide a query with a clear intent? What if shorter queries are used to demonstrate a more vague intent? We find that the performance of NCS regresses with shorter queries. Furthermore, data from developers’ code search history logs shows that shorter queries have a less successful code search session: there are more query reformulations and more time is spent browsing the results. These observations lead us to believe that using NCS alone with short queries may not be productive enough. In this paper, we explore an additional way of using neural networks in code search: the automatic expansion of queries. We present NQE, a neural model that takes in a set of keywords and predicts a set of keywords to expand the query to NCS. NQE learns to predict keywords that co-occur with the query keywords in the underlying corpus, which helps expand the query in a productive way. Our results show that with query expansion, NQE + NCS is able to perform better than using NCS alone.},

abstract = {Deep neural networks (DNNs) are becoming an integral part of most software systems. Previous work has shown that DNNs have bugs. Unfortunately, existing debugging techniques don't support localizing DNN bugs because of the lack of understanding of model behaviors. The entire DNN model appears as a black box. To address these problems, we propose an approach and a tool that automatically determines whether the model is buggy or not, and identifies the root causes for DNN errors. Our key insight is that historic trends in values propagated between layers can be analyzed to identify faults, and also localize faults. To that end, we first enable dynamic analysis of deep learning applications: by converting it into an imperative representation and alternatively using a callback mechanism. Both mechanisms allows us to insert probes that enable dynamic analysis over the traces produced by the DNN while it is being trained on the training data. We then conduct dynamic analysis over the traces to identify the faulty layer or hyperparameter that causes the error. We propose an algorithm for identifying root causes by capturing any numerical error and monitoring the model during training and finding the relevance of every layer/parameter on the DNN outcome. We have collected a benchmark containing 40 buggy models and patches that contain real errors in deep learning applications from Stack Overflow and GitHub. Our benchmark can be used to evaluate automated debugging tools and repair techniques. We have evaluated our approach using this DNN bug-and-patch benchmark, and the results showed that our approach is much more effective than the existing debugging approach used in the state-of-the-practice Keras library. For 34/40 cases, our approach was able to detect faults whereas the best debugging approach provided by Keras detected 32/40 faults. Our approach was able to localize 21/40 bugs whereas Keras did not localize any faults.},

The research was conducted with undergraduate students through questionnaire and analysis methods to test all the proposed research hypotheses. And research model was evaluated with structural equation modeling. Results of this empirical study indicated that computer self-efficacy, Internet self-efficacy and personal outcome expectation positively affect undergraduate students’ knowledge sharing in learning virtual communities.

abstract = {Stack Overflow, a question and answer website, uses a reward system called badges to publicly reward users for their contributions to the community. Badges are used alongside a reputation score to reward positive behaviour by relating a user's site identity with their perceived expertise and respect in the community. A greater number of badges associated with a user profile in some way indicates a higher level of authority, leading to a natural incentive for users to attempt to achieve as many badges as possible. In this study, we examine the publicly available logs for Stack Overflow to examine three of these badges in detail. We look at the effect of one badge in context on an individual user level and at the global scope of three related badges across all users by mining user behaviour around the time that the badge is awarded. This analysis supports the claim that badges can be used to influence user behaviour by demonstrating one instance of an increase in user activity related to a badge immediately before it is awarded when compared to the period afterwards.},

abstract = {Previous studies have documented the application of administrative claim dataset for health services research purposes. In addition to administrative and billing details of healthcare services, insurance claim datasets can reveal important information regarding professional interactions or links that evolve among healthcare service providers through, for example, informal knowledge sharing. The aim of this study is to develop a research framework, which uses details of such professional interactions, to learn about effective healthcare coordination and collaboration. The proposed framework has been exercised to analyse Patient-centric Care Coordination Network and Physician Collaboration Network. The usefulness of this framework and its applications in exploring different collaborative efforts of healthcare service providers have been discussed in this paper.},

abstract = {Creating a standard for knowledge representation and reasoning in autonomous robotics is an urgent task if we consider recent advances in robotics as well as predictions about the insertion of robots in human daily life. Indeed, this will impact the way information is exchanged between multiple robots or between robots and humans and how they can all understand it without ambiguity. Indeed, Human Robot Interaction (HRI) represents the interaction of at least two cognition models (Human and Robot). Such interaction informs task composition, task assignment, communication, cooperation and coordination in a dynamic environment, requiring a flexible representation. Hence, this paper presents the IEEE RAS Autonomous Robotics (AuR) Study Group, which is a spin-off of the IEEE Ontologies for Robotics and Automation (ORA) Working Group, and and its ongoing work to develop the first IEEE-RAS ontology standard for autonomous robotics. In particular, this paper reports on the current version of the ontology for autonomous robotics as well as on its first implementation successfully validated for a human-robot interaction scenario, demonstrating the developed ontology's strengths which include semantic interoperability and capability to relate ontologies from different fields for knowledge sharing and interactions.},

However, since the E-health subject is a multi-disciplinary and cross-organizational area, to have shared concepts, vocabulary plus a specification of its intended meaning, namely an ontology, has been an obstacle to develop e-health system. We will in this paper propose a knowledge sharing ontology on the basis of Activity Theory. We believe that Activity Theory can provide high level and rich ontology for the developers of E-health system to encompass the multi-disciplinary and cross-organizational knowledge. We validate our approach in the end by demonstrating our project IMIS (Integrated Mobile Information System for Healthcare) that uses the activity theory as ontological architecture for the construction of the whole system.},

Many agent-based applications either employ a basic form of knowledge sharing, or employ a more complicated form, such as the communication by word-of-mouth. The purpose of this paper is to provide an agent-based formalization of knowledge sharing. Such a unique solution includes the design and implementation of an agent-based Application Programming Interface (API) capable of allowing different forms of knowledge sharing between agents. In addition, a GUI is provided that interfaces with the agent-based API and provides visualization of agent simulations. The functionality of the API, and accompanying GUI, is demonstrated by the implementation of an agent-based traffic simulation. Moreover, the results of the agent-based traffic simulation are used to evaluate the effectiveness of alternative knowledge sharing methods.},

abstract = {It is widely acknowledged that the knowledge and skills of individuals directly affect the ability of organisations to innovate and to provide quality end-products or services, thus, gaining competitive benefits and higher revenues [1], [2], [3]. However, it is difficult to manage knowledge as it resides in human minds. Many efforts have been made for capturing tacit knowledge of employees and making it available in knowledge management systems, however, the initial failures have resulted in applying more "soft tools" (e.g. creativity and group facilitation techniques) and supporting communication and knowledge sharing among employees [12], [13]. Subsequently, for finding expertise in organisations are proposed techniques for visualising knowledge sources (e.g. yellow pages, skills maps, etc.) [4], [12].This paper extends the patterns discussed at VikingPLoP 2014 and EuroPLoP 2015 in the area of Knowledge Management Systems design. Its goal is to present a pattern related to Info-Structure design [8], and more specifically focused on knowledge profiles of employees.},

abstract = {Community Question Answering (CQA) sites facilitate users to ask questions and get answered by fellow users interested in the topic of the question. A vast number of questions are posted on these sites every day. Some questions receive numbers of good quality answers whereas some questions fail to attract even a single answer from the community users. Also, some questions receive very late answers. The problem behind the unanswered question or late answers was that the question was not seen or not routed to the expert user or interested users. There are no identified experts of given topic on these sites. Hence, finding users who will be interested in answering a question of the specific topic and sending the question to that user is a challenging task. We have developed a system to identify the group of users who can potentially be the answerer of a given question. The group of users is identified using their past question and answers. We rank the users of the identified group considering their answering behaviour, time of posting their answers etc. The proposed methodology has several advantages such as routing questions to recently active users and at the time of their convenience. Experimental analysis shows that to get at least one answer, the question must be routed to at least eight answerers.},

Recently, various approaches have been proposed to automatically find experts in Question answering websites. In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid approach to effectively find experts for the category of the target question in question answering websites. Our approach considers user subject relevance, user reputation and authority of a category in finding experts.

Different robot expertness measures are applied to these knowledge sharing techniques in order to improve learning performance. We proposed a new robot expertness measure based on regret evaluation. The regret takes uncertainty bounds of two best actions, i.e. greedy action and the second best action, into account. Simulations were performed to compare the effectiveness of the three expertness measures i.e. expertness based on accumulated rewards, on average move and on regret measure, when applied to different sharing techniques. Our proposed measure resulted in better performance than the other expertness measures. Analysis and comparison of different knowledge sharing techniques are also provided herein.},

abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) is defined as the connection between places and physical objects (i.e., things) over the internet/network via smart computing devices. IoT is a rapidly emerging paradigm that now encompasses almost every aspect of our modern life. As such, it is crucial to ensure IoT devices follow strict security requirements. At the same time, the prevalence of IoT devices offers developers a chance to design and develop Machine Learning (ML)-based intelligent software systems using their IoT devices. However, given the diversity of IoT devices, IoT developers may find it challenging to introduce appropriate security and ML techniques into their devices. Traditionally, we learn about the IoT ecosystem/problems by conducting surveys of IoT developers/practitioners. Another way to learn is by analyzing IoT developer discussions in popular online developer forums like Stack Overflow (SO). However, we are aware of no such studies that focused on IoT developers’ security and ML-related discussions in SO. This paper offers the results of preliminary study of IoT developer discussions in SO. First, we collect around 53K IoT posts (questions + accepted answers) from SO. Second, we tokenize each post into sentences. Third, we automatically identify sentences containing security and ML-related discussions. We find around 12\% of sentences contain security discussions, while around 0.12\% sentences contain ML-related discussions. There is no overlap between security and ML-related discussions, i.e., IoT developers discussing security requirements did not discuss ML requirements and vice versa. We find that IoT developers discussing security issues frequently inquired about how the shared data can be stored, shared, and transferred securely across IoT devices and users. We also find that IoT developers are interested to adopt deep neural network-based ML models into their IoT devices, but they find it challenging to accommodate those into their resource-constrained IoT devices. Our findings offer implications for IoT vendors and researchers to develop and design novel techniques for improved security and ML adoption into IoT devices.},

However, there are two important challenges to be addressed: i) combination of individual and organizational incentives that motivate employees to take part in knowledge building and sharing activities; and ii) structuring of learning and knowledge building activities and their outcomes in a representation that can assure unambiguous knowledge sharing. To address these challenges, we propose a framework of individual and organizational factors for knowledge sharing and a set of ontologies that provides a systematic and interlinked representation of concepts of individual and organizational learning. On top of these proposals, we developed and here present a software solution, which has been evaluated through a case study conducted in a large enterprise context.},

abstract = {The global open source software ecosystem contains rich information in the field of software engineering. The existing analysis methods for the text content of the knowledge community in this field are mainly focus on the structural relationship and rule-based association and mining. This paper proposes a software entity recognition method based on BERT word embedding. Firstly, the BiLSTM-CRF model is constructed, and the entity recognition model is constructed by combining the word vector embedding in software engineering field. Then, the word vector in the input layer of the model is improved by introducing the BERT pre-training language model. In the process of pre-training of BERT, the pre-training data should be constructed based on the discussion content of Stack Overflow software Q \&amp; A community. Then, we use these data to pre-training the BERT model, so as to obtain the word vector representation suitable for software engineering field, improving the effect of entity recognition in software engineering field, and solving the problem that the traditional word vector embedding is mostly based on the general domain data training, which is not fully suitable for software engineering field, and can’t well represent the context semantic information. At the same time, to solve the problem that there are few annotated data in the field of software, this paper tries to extends the data appropriately by the method of model prediction and dictionary matching, and carries out experimental test. Finally, this paper uses the method of deep learning to realize the entity recognition in the field of software engineering, so as to provide support for the extraction of software entities, the construction of software knowledge base, and the intelligent application of software engineering.},

The result shows that the manufacturer’s participation level in knowledge sharing and developing is a function of the ratio between dyadic marginal profits of the logistics collaboration performance, which is independent to the prior efforts of both sides. And the condition for manufacturer participating collaboration was identified. Then, the influence of prior efforts in logistics knowledge creation from two parts on system parameter was investigated as well.},

abstract = {Community Health workers (CHWs) are the foundation of public health services aimed to connect the gap between communities, health and social service system, and it is done by navigating the health and human services system and educating communities on disease prevention. Unfortunately, the way of sharing and accessing information for delivering the services is often very unreliable by using manual system for reporting which can cause error and falsification. Furthermore, the Staff which performs these duties often they do not have knowledge about disease and health system training or education. To address this need, a mobile application System for CHWs is needed, which enables community health workers to automatically send a report of monthly activities without using any manual input form. Making use of the digital device (the smartphone, PDAs, and The Augmented Reality Personal Digital Assistant. The mobile application will automatically allow submit a report, transfer knowledge, sharing information and receiving training by using the user interface which will have the features like social media. Also the electronic file for entering information will be filled automatically. The system will be recording and uploaded to a central server for use by CHWs supervisor and the health manager official. This article provides ICTs with a regard to Mobile Health System and the probable of field which are lacking. Its absence is root of challenges faced by CHWs, the solutions to challenges is to design technological (Mobile Health System) which create durable, imperishable answers for tending to the world's wellbeing need.},

abstract = {Modern Code Review (MCR) an effective quality assurance technique that can ensure software quality and customer satisfaction through the identification of defects, code improvement and accelerating the development process. It is an asynchronous and lightweight review process supported with review tools, for instance, Gerrit. It is a light version of Fagan's inspection process and has developed as a practice for open-source and industrial software development. Researches have been conducted in the context of MCR utilizing various data collection methodologies such as interviews, surveys and comment analysis from review tools. Besides defect detection, other benefits have been reported concerning MCR process adoption, for instance, knowledge sharing, team awareness, collaboration, etc. However, the team members involved in MCR activities are not aware of the benefits of MCR activities as the literature is dispersed. No, systematize study available reporting benefits concerning MCR. As a consequence, there is a lack of actual awareness of the adoption of the MCR process. Therefore, the objective of the study is to systematically analyze and report the benefits of the MCR process. Systematic Literature Review has been utilized to identify MCR benefits. Thematic analysis has been performed to group the identified benefits into the relevant themes. The themes and reported benefits are validated by the experts for their relevancy. The study findings report 54 unique benefits, grouped into 9 themes. This research has implications for the software industry, engineer and researchers. The industry can incorporate the MCR process widely, whereas software engineers being aware of the real benefits of MCR can provide their participation effectively in achieving those benefits in reality. In future, the researchers can extend this study by identifying more benefits in different research settings and by quantifying the reported benefits of MCR.},

abstract = {In order to solve the issues of mismatches between the intentions of questioners and respondents of Question and Answer (Q&amp;A) sites, nine factors of impressions for Q&amp;A statements have been obtained through impressive experiments. Factor scores have been then estimated through multiple regression analysis by using the feature values of statements, e.g. syntactic information, etc. The factor scores obtained have been subsequently used for inspecting the possibility of detecting respondents who are expected to post appropriate answer to a newly posted question. However, the method so far has been largely dependent on the syntactic information extracted through morphological analysis. In addition, the number of explanatory variables used for estimating factor scores has been considerably numerous and complicated. Therefore, in this paper, factor scores are estimated using the feature values of syntactic information are extracted through 2-gram, instead of morphological analysis. The feature values based on 2-gram and those other than the syntactic information are set as explanatory variable. As a result of another multiple regression analysis, estimation accuracy with 2-gram shows almost equal to or better than that with morphological analysis for all the nine factors. Moreover, monadic term is sufficient in estimating factor scores, leading to much smaller samples of explanatory variables.},

In this setting, closely related problems often lead to the same characteristic learning pattern --- people sharing a similar problem visit closely related pieces of information, perform almost identical queries or, more generally, take a series of similar actions at a similar pace. In this paper, we introduce a novel modeling framework for clustering continuous-time grouped streaming data, the Hierarchical Dirichlet Hawkes process (HDHP), which allows us to automatically uncover a wide variety of learning patterns from detailed traces of learning activity. Our model allows for efficient inference, scaling to millions of actions and thousands of users. Experiments on real data from Stack Overflow reveal that our framework recovers meaningful learning patterns, accurately tracks users' interests and goals over time and achieves better predictive performance than the state of the art.},

Answers, little is known about why answers on academic Q&amp;A sites are voted on by scholars who follow the discussion threads to be high quality answers. Using 1021 answers obtained from the Q&amp;A part of an academic social network site ResearchGate (RG), we firstly explored whether various web-captured features and human-coded features can be the critical factors that influence the peer-judged answer quality. Then using the identified critical features, we constructed three classification models to predict the peer-judged rating. Our results identify four main findings. Firstly, responders' authority, shorter response time and greater answer length are the critical features that positively associate with the peer-judged answer quality. Secondly, answers containing social elements are very likely to harm the peer-judged answer quality. Thirdly, an optimized SVM algorithm has an overwhelming advantage over other models in terms of accuracy. Finally, the prediction based on web-captured features had better performance when comparing to prediction on human-coded features. We hope that these interesting insights on ResearchGate's answer quality can help the further design of academic Q&amp;A sites.},

abstract = {Background: Docker technology has been increasingly used among software developers in a multitude of projects. This growing interest is due to the fact that Docker technology supports a convenient process for creating and building containers, promoting close cooperation between developer and operations teams, and enabling continuous software delivery. As a fast-growing technology, it is important to identify the Docker-related topics that are most popular as well as existing challenges and difficulties that developers face.Aims: This paper presents a large-scale empirical study identifying practitioners' perspectives on Docker technology by mining posts from the Stack Overflow (SoF) community. Method: A dataset of 113, 922 Docker-related posts was created based on a set of relevant tags and contents. The dataset was cleaned and prepared. Topic modelling was conducted using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), allowing the identification of dominant topics in the domain. Results: Our results show that most developers use SoF to ask about a broad spectrum of Docker topics including framework development, application deployment, continuous integration, web-server configuration and many more. We determined that 30 topics that developers discuss can be grouped into 13 main categories. Most of the posts belong to categories of application development, configuration, and networking. On the other hand, we find that the posts on monitoring status, transferring data, and authenticating users are more popular among developers compared to the other topics. Specifically, developers face challenges in web browser issues, networking error and memory management. Besides, there is a lack of experts in this domain. Conclusion: Our research findings will guide future work on the development of new tools and techniques, helping the community to focus efforts and understand existing trade-offs on Docker topics.},

abstract = {Low bug report quality and human conflicts pose challenges to keep bug tracking systems productive. This work proposes to address these issues by applying game mechanisms to bug tracking systems. We investigate the use of game mechanisms in Stack Overflow, an online community organized to resolve computer programming related problems, for which the improvements we seek for bug tracking systems also turn out to be relevant. The results of our Stack Overflow investigation show that its game mechanisms could be used to address these issues by motivating contributors to increase contribution frequency and quality, by filtering useful contributions, and by creating an agile and dependable moderation system. We proceed by mapping these mechanisms to open-source bug tracking systems, and find that most benefits are applicable. Additionally, our results motivate tailoring a reward and reputation system and summarizing bug reports as future directions for increasing the benefits of game mechanisms in bug tracking systems.},

This is often the case in bug and feature location, community question answering, or more generally the communication between technical personnel and non-technical stake holders in a software project. In this paper, we propose bridging the lexical gap by projecting natural language statements and code snippets as meaning vectors in a shared representation space. In the proposed architecture, word embeddings are first trained on API documents, tutorials, and reference documents, and then aggregated in order to estimate semantic similarities between documents. Empirical evaluations show that the learned vector space embeddings lead to improvements in a previously explored bug localization task and a newly defined task of linking API documents to computer programming questions.},

For example, in Java, the programming concept "array" does not match with its syntactic representation of "[ ]". Code search engines can assist developers more effectively over natural language queries if such mappings existed for a variety of programming languages. In this work, we present a programming language agnostic technique to discover such mappings between syntactic forms and natural language terms representing programming concepts. We use the questions and answers in Stack Overflow to create this mapping. We implement our approach in a tool called ANNE. To evaluate its effectiveness, we conduct a user study in an academic setting in which teaching assistants use ANNE to search for code snippets in student submissions. With the use of ANNE, we find that the participants are 29\% quicker with no significant drop in correctness and completeness.},

abstract = {Many ICT applications and services, including those from the Semantic Web, rely on the Web for the exchange of data. This includes expensive server and network infrastructures. Most rural areas of developing countries are not reached by the Web and its possibilities, while at the same time the ability to share knowledge has been identified as a key enabler for development. To make widespread knowledge sharing possible in these rural areas, the notion of the Web has to be downscaled based on the specific low-resource infrastructure in place. In this paper, we introduce SPARQL over SMS, a solution for Web-like exchange of RDF data over cellular networks in which HTTP is substituted by SMS. We motivate and validate this through two use cases in West Africa. We present the design and implementation of the solution, along with a data compression method that combines generic compression strategies and strategies that use Semantic Web specific features to reduce the size of RDF before it is transferred over the low-bandwidth cellular network.},

The SO license requires attribution, i.e., referencing the original question or answer, and requires derived work to adopt a compatible license. While there is a heated debate on SO's license model for code snippets and the required attribution, little is known about the extent to which snippets are copied from SO without proper attribution. In this paper, we present the research design and summarized results of an empirical study analyzing attributed and unattributed usages of SO code snippets in GitHub projects. On average, 3.22\% of all analyzed repositories and 7.33\% of the popular ones contained a reference to SO. Further, we found that developers rather refer to the whole thread on SO than to a specific answer. For Java, at least two thirds of the copied snippets were not attributed.},

abstract = {Deep learning methods are useful for high-dimensional data and are becoming widely used in many areas of software engineering. Deep learners utilizes extensive computational power and can take a long time to train- making it difficult to widely validate and repeat and improve their results. Further, they are not the best solution in all domains. For example, recent results show that for finding related Stack Overflow posts, a tuned SVM performs similarly to a deep learner, but is significantly faster to train.This paper extends that recent result by clustering the dataset, then tuning every learners within each cluster. This approach is over 500 times faster than deep learning (and over 900 times faster if we use all the cores on a standard laptop computer). Significantly, this faster approach generates classifiers nearly as good (within 2\% F1 Score) as the much slower deep learning method. Hence we recommend this faster methods since it is much easier to reproduce and utilizes far fewer CPU resources.More generally, we recommend that before researchers release research results, that they compare their supposedly sophisticated methods against simpler alternatives (e.g applying simpler learners to build local models).},

abstract = {In a post disaster scenario, assessment of resource needs is indeed challenging because needs are constantly changing and supplies trickle in at an uncertain rate. Moreover, information about resource needs of far-flung areas get rarely permeated owing to the disruption of cellular and other communication infrastructure, leading to a huge gap in perception about the actual needs in those areas. Therefore, a dynamic need assessment mechanism is essential to stay abreast of the actual situation. Movements of volunteers and relief workers are governed by two dominant characteristics of human mobility - spatial locality and spatial regularity. In this paper, we make use of such mobility characteristics to propose a knowledge sharing based approach for dynamic assessment of post disaster resource needs using a smart-phone based delay tolerant network (DTN). The proposed technique caters to the objective of bridging the gap in perception about actual resource needs.},

abstract = {In recent times, deep neural networks have found success in Collaborative Filtering (CF) based recommendation tasks. By parametrizing latent factor interactions of users and items with neural architectures, they achieve significant gains in scalability and performance over matrix factorization. However, the long-tail phenomenon in recommender performance persists on the massive inventories of online media or retail platforms. Given the diversity of neural architectures and applications, there is a need to develop a generalizable and principled strategy to enhance long-tail item coverage.In this paper, we propose a novel adversarial training strategy to enhance long-tail recommendations for users with Neural CF (NCF) models. The adversary network learns the implicit association structure of entities in the feedback data while the NCF model is simultaneously trained to reproduce these associations and avoid the adversarial penalty, resulting in enhanced long-tail performance. Experimental results show that even without auxiliary data, adversarial training can boost long-tail recall of state-of-the-art NCF models by up to 25\%, without trading-off overall performance. We evaluate our approach on two diverse platforms, content tag recommendation in Q&amp;A forums and movie recommendation.},

These evaluations can be viewed as noisy measurements of both information reliability and information source trustworthiness. Can we leverage these noisy evaluations, often biased, to distill a robust, unbiased and interpretable measure of both notions?In this talk, I will first argue that the temporal traces left by these noisy evaluations give cues on the reliability of the information and the trustworthiness of the sources. Then, I will introduce a temporal point process modeling framework that links these temporal traces to robust, unbiased and interpretable notions of information reliability and source trustworthiness. Finally, I will elaborate on large-scale experiments on real-world data gathered from Wikipedia and Stack Overflow and show that our modeling framework accurately predicts evaluation events, provides an interpretable measure of information reliability and source trustworthiness, and yields interesting insights about real-world events.},

abstract = {Social networks such as Twitter and Facebook are important and widely used communication environments that exhibit scale, complexity, node interaction, and emergent behavior. In this paper, we analyze emergent behavior in Twitter and propose a definition of emergent behavior focused on the pervasiveness of a topic within a community. We extend an existing stochastic model for user behavior, focusing on advocate-follower relationships. The new user posting model includes retweets, replies, and mentions as user responses. To capture emergence, we propose a RPBS (Rising, Plateau, Burst and Stabilization) topic pervasiveness model with a new metric that captures how frequent and in what form the community is talking about a particular topic. Our initial validation compares our model with four Twitter datasets. Our extensive experimental analysis allows us to explore several "what-if" scenarios with respect to topic and knowledge sharing, showing how a pervasive topic evolves given various popularity scenarios.},

It has many useful applications in areas such as schema matching, ontology matching, scientific knowledge management, e-commerce, enterprise application integration, etc. With the desire of knowledge sharing and reuse in these fields, merging commonly occurs among different organizations where the knowledge describing the same domain is to be matched. Due to the different naming conventions, granularity and the use of concepts in different contexts, a semantic approach to this problem is preferred in comparison to syntactic approach that performs matches based upon the labels only. We propose a concept matching method that initially does not consider labels when forming candidate matches, but rather utilizes structural information to take the context into account and detect complex matches. Real world knowledge representations (schemas) are used to evaluate the method.},

Considerable research efforts have been devoted to studying users' information and knowledge sharing within SQA sites. Past research, however, has neglected users' information sharing behavior from SQA to other social media platforms (e.g., microblogs). In this study, we utilized Zhihu, one of the most popular Chinese SQA sites, as a lens to explore users' information sharing from SQA to third parties, as this has become a widespread behavior among Chinese Web users. A survey that gathered 591 valid responses yielded interesting findings. Overall, respondents who had higher educational levels and who spent more daily time on the Internet via mobile devices were more likely to share SQA posts to other virtual spaces. Their experiences with Zhihu, their content preferences, and their friends' sharing behavior also significantly influenced their sharing behavior. Our findings generate quite a few directions for future research.},

abstract = {It is widely recognized that knowledge sharing and learning are most effective when occurring in an appropriate and supportive context. As a consequence when designing an educational process the context has to be carefully considered. Implementing "situated learning" is straightforward in traditional apprenticeship models that inspired the communities of practice model, and the centuries old university model, but poses a formidable challenge when knowledge and associated practices are to be shared with large numbers of students as it is the case in most contemporary, demand-driven universities and even more in MOOCs. The traditional, and well tested, face-to-face teaching model that is in place does not scale even if videoconferencing is utilized to include students at remote locations. A few years ago, MOOCs were presented as a viable "solution", but while participant numbers remain impressive, experiences also suggest that the learning experience does not scale as easily. In this paper we discuss an alternative knowledge sharing and learning model, the Shangh AI Lectures (SHAIL) developed at the University of Zurich, Switzerland in response to the need of making top quality higher education available to a worldwide audience. SHAIL combines some of the strongest aspects of traditional face-to-face teaching, but also allows lecturing from and to a community which is globally distributed. Findings from delivering the Shangh AI Lectures annually over five consecutive years to up to twenty universities from across the globe (North America, Africa, Europe, Asia, Oceania) suggest that SHAIL is a promising way to address "global teaching", but there are also challenges to be addressed such as: finding a common base with respect to university requirements, student goals and expectations, teaching styles, and of course the actual technologies used.},

Some candidates are missed by this approach, e.g., due to a vocabulary mismatch. We address this issue by replacing the term-based search with a generic k-NN retrieval algorithm, where a similarity function can take into account subtle term associations. While an exact brute-force k-NN search using this similarity function is slow, we demonstrate that an approximate algorithm can be nearly two orders of magnitude faster at the expense of only a small loss in accuracy. A retrieval pipeline using an approximate k-NN search can be more effective and efficient than the term-based pipeline. This opens up new possibilities for designing effective retrieval pipelines. Our software (including data-generating code) and derivative data based on the Stack Overflow collection is available online.},

abstract = {A Community of Practice (CoP) allows practitioners of a clearly defined domain to share knowledge, experience, and best practices. It provides a social context for practitioners, often distributed across multiple organizations, and emerged over the last few decades as a fundamental mechanism for knowledge sharing, management, and generation within organizations. Best practices, innovations, and solutions to shared problems first emerge within CoPs. These are, and must be perceived as, an investment in organizations' future and competitiveness.Establishing a CoP is a straightforward process, the most challenging factor being the recruitment of members to attain critical mass. The challenge is to maintain the CoP active, with members contributing with high quality, innovative content. Increasing a CoP's medium / long-term survival probabilities requires careful planning to avoid incurring in some well-known pitfalls.This paper proposes and discusses a set of nine guidelines for establishing and maintaining a community of practice within the context of Electronic Governance (EGOV) and Government Chief Information Officers (GCIO). This research was motivated by the initiative of the government of a developing country. Results are based on a review of the relevant literature, together with the detailed analysis of interviews to members or coordinators of large communities of practice. This analysis was further validated against the opinions of public servants directly involved on EGOV-GCIO-related functions during two focus groups meetings.},

abstract = {In this paper, we propose solutions to advance answer selection in Community Question Answering (CQA). Unlike previous works, we propose a hybrid attention mechanism to model question-answer pairs. Specifically, for each word, we calculate the intra-sentence attention indicating its local importance and the inter-sentence attention implying its importance to the counterpart sentence. The inter-sentence attention is based on the interactions between question-answer pairs, and the combination of these two attention mechanisms enables us to align the most informative parts in question-answer pairs for sentence matching. Additionally, we exploit user information for answer selection due to the fact that users are more likely to provide correct answers in their areas of expertise. We model users from their written answers to alleviate data sparsity problem, and then learn user representations according to the informative parts in sentences that are useful for question-answer matching task. This mean of modelling users can bridge the semantic gap between different users, as similar users may have the same way of wording their answers. The representations of users, questions and answers are learnt in an end-to-end neural network in a mean that best explains the interrelation between question-answer pairs. We validate the proposed model on a public dataset, and demonstrate its advantages over the baselines with thorough experiments.},

Novel solutions are needed so as to help ageing workers maintain workability and productivity, along with a balance between work and personal life, which supports them into good quality of life, active and healthy ageing. In this line, the "Ageing@work" project, initiated by the European Union, develops a novel ICT-based, personalized system to support ageing workers (aged 50+) into designing fit for purpose work environments and managing flexibly their evolving needs. On top of personalized, dynamically adapted worker and workplace models, computational intelligence will assess user specificities and needs i.r.t. work conditions, both in terms of ergonomics, health and safety issues and task assignments. Recommendations will then be provided both to the worker and company, under strict privacy restrictions, on how the working conditions must adapt. The worker models will be populated by unobtrusive worker sensing, both at work, at home and on the move. To foster workability and productivity, personalized, intuitive, age-friendly productivity, co-design enhancement tools will be developed, including ones for AR/VR-based context-awareness and telepresence, lifelong learning and knowledge sharing. On top of these, a novel Ambient Virtual Coach (AVC) will encompass an empathic mirroring avatar for subtle notifications provision, an adaptive Visual Analytics - based personal dashboard, and a reward-based motivation system targeting positive and balanced worker behavior at work and personal life, towards a novel paradigm of ambient support into workability and well-being. The integrated system will be developed by user-centered design and will be evaluated at two pilot sites, related to core Industry 4.0 processes of mining and machines production.},

Organizational dynamics of information management and knowledge sharing have gained less attention. This article outlines how an information security risk assessment method can be elaborated using knowledge-centric analysis of information assets. For this purpose, we suggest the use of a genre-based analysis method for identifying organizational communication patterns, through which organizational knowledge is shared. Initial experiences of the method try-outs by three experienced information security professionals are discussed. The article concludes with a look at the implications of a genre-based analysis of knowledge assets for future research and practice.},

abstract = {In this paper, we analyze the network of expertise constructed from the interactions of users on the online question-answering (QA) community of Stack Overflow. This community was built with the intention of helping users with their programming tasks and, thus, questions are expected to be highly factual. This also indicates that the answers one provides may be highly indicative of one's level of expertise on the subject matter. Therefore, our main concern is how to model and characterize the user's expertise based on the constructed network and its centrality measures. We used the user's reputation established on Stack Overflow as a direct proxy to their expertise. We further made use of linear models and principal component analysis for the purpose. We found out that the current reputation system does a decent job at representing the user's expertise and that focus matters when answering factual questions. However, our model was not able to capture the other larger half of reputation which is specifically designed to reflect a user's trustworthiness besides their expertise. Along the way, we also discovered facts that have been known in earlier studies of the other/same QA communities such as the power-law degree distribution of the network and the generalized reciprocity pattern among its users.},

abstract = {Matching a question to its best answer is a common task in community question answering. In this paper, we focus on the non-factoid questions and aim to pick out the best answer from its candidate answers. Most of the existing deep models directly measure the similarity between question and answer by their individual sentence embeddings. In order to tackle the problem of the information lack in question's descriptions and the lexical gap between questions and answers, we propose a novel deep architecture namely SPAN in this paper. Specifically we introduce support answers to help understand the question, which are defined as the best answers of those similar questions to the original one. Then we can obtain two kinds of similarities, one is between question and the candidate answer, and the other one is between support answers and the candidate answer. The matching score is finally generated by combining them. Experiments on Yahoo! Answers demonstrate that SPAN can outperform the baseline models.},

Managing this response effort was a complex undertaking that relied extensively on knowledge management systems (KMS). For the first time, however, US government agencies employed social media technologies such as wikis and collaborative workspaces as the main knowledge sharing mechanisms. In this research we present a case study developed through action research of how these social media technologies were used, what influences they made on knowledge sharing, reuse, and decision-making, and how knowledge was effectively (and at times ineffectively) maintained in these systems. First-hand knowledge of the response is used, offering strategies for future deployment of social media and important research questions that remain regarding social media as knowledge management systems, particularly for disaster and emergency management.},

abstract = {Directed graphs have been widely used in Community Question Answering services (CQAs) to model asymmetric relationships among different types of nodes in CQA graphs, e.g., question, answer, user. Asymmetric transitivity is an essential property of directed graphs, since it can play an important role in downstream graph inference and analysis. Question difficulty and user expertise follow the characteristic of asymmetric transitivity. Maintaining such properties, while reducing the graph to a lower dimensional vector embedding space, has been the focus of much recent research. In this paper, we tackle the challenge of directed graph embedding with asymmetric transitivity preservation and then leverage the proposed embedding method to solve a fundamental task in CQAs: how to appropriately route and assign newly posted questions to users with the suitable expertise and interest in CQAs. The technique incorporates graph hierarchy and reachability information naturally by relying on a nonlinear transformation that operates on the core reachability and implicit hierarchy within such graphs. Subsequently, the methodology levers a factorization-based approach to generate two embedding vectors for each node within the graph, to capture the asymmetric transitivity. Extensive experiments show that our framework consistently and significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines on three diverse real-world tasks: link prediction, and question difficulty estimation and expert finding in online forums like Stack Exchange. Particularly, our framework can support inductive embedding learning for newly posted questions (unseen nodes during training), and therefore can properly route and assign these kinds of questions to experts in CQAs.},

abstract = {Community question answering (CQA) forums can provide effective means for sharing information and addressing a user's information needs about particular topics. However, many such online forums are not moderated, resulting in many low quality and redundant comments, which makes it very challenging for users to find the appropriate answers to their questions. In this paper, we apply a user-centered design approach to develop a system, CQAVis, which supports users in identifying high quality comments and get their questions answered. Informed by the user's requirements, the system combines both text analytics and interactive visualization techniques together in a synergistic way. Given a new question posed by the user, the text analytic module automatically finds relevant answers by exploring existing related questions and the comments within their threads. Then the visualization module presents the search results to the user and supports the exploration of related comments. We have evaluated the system in the wild by deploying it within a CQA forum among thousands of real users. Through the online study, we gained deeper insights about the potential utility of the system, as well as learned generalizable lessons for designing visual text analytics systems for the domain of CQA forums.},

Specifically, we build on Zander and Kogut's work [29] and examine the relationship between knowledge dimensions and knowledge sharing. Departing from their study, we focus on person-to-person, rather than organization-to-organization, knowledge sharing. We surveyed 68 employees of a Workman's Compensation Board in Canada. To analyze the data, we employed Hierarchical Linear Modeling. The results demonstrate that complexity and teachability increased person-to-person knowledge sharing but observability did not. Contrary to expectations, the availability of codified knowledge in a knowledge management system (KMS) had no impact on person-to-person knowledge transfer; individuals were as likely to share knowledge person-to-person regardless of whether there was a KMS available that contained appropriate knowledge.},

Mathematical analysis results show that the optimal incentive contract is determined when both sides reach the stable equilibrium state. If the parameters change, enterprise will simultaneously adjust the incentive strategy, and the optimal action of project team will accordingly vary to maximize bilateral benefits.},

It is often claimed that such state-of-the-art QA systems far outperform traditional IR baselines such as BM25. However, most such studies rely on relatively small data sets, e.g., those extracted from the old TREC QA tracks. Given massive training data plus a separate corpus of Q&amp;A pairs as the target knowledge source, how well would such a system really perform? How fast would it respond? In this demonstration, we provide the attendees of SIGIR 2017 an opportunity to experience a live comparison of two open-domain QA systems, one based on a long short-term memory (LSTM) architecture with over 11 million Yahoo! Chiebukuro (i.e., Japanese Yahoo! Answers) questions and over 27.4 million answers for training, and the other based on BM25. Both systems use the same Q&amp;A knowledge source for answer retrieval. Our core demonstration system is a pair of Japanese monolingual QA systems, but we leverage machine translation for letting the SIGIR attendees enter English questions and compare the Japanese responses from the two systems after translating them into English.},

abstract = {Social networks make an essential contribution to knowledge sharing in our fast moving and changing world. However, it is difficult to apply new techniques to the complex, firm and Europe-wide differing educational systems. And this process for technology enhanced learning is still evolving and challenging. This paper presents the research results of applying social network analysis methods to a real and lively social network which intends to enhance the cooperation and knowledge sharing among over 45,000 European schools within the eTwinning network. We developed a web-based tool for network analysis and the visualization of various network views and data mining results as proof of concept. This prototype is evaluated on the educational social network eTwinning coordinated by the European Schoolnet, with special regard to its network structure and collaboration activity.},

abstract = {Abundant data is the key to successful machine learning. However, supervised learning requires annotated data that are often hard to obtain. In a classification task with limited resources, Active Learning (AL) promises to guide annotators to examples that bring the most value for a classifier. AL can be successfully combined with self-training, i.e., extending a training set with the unlabelled examples for which a classifier is the most certain. We report our experiences on using AL in a systematic manner to train an SVM classifier for Stack Overflow posts discussing performance of software components. We show that the training examples deemed as the most valuable to the classifier are also the most difficult for humans to annotate. Despite carefully evolved annotation criteria, we report low inter-rater agreement, but we also propose mitigation strategies. Finally, based on one annotator's work, we show that self-training can improve the classification accuracy. We conclude the paper by discussing implication for future text miners aspiring to use AL and self-training.},

The challenge for such teams is to align their process knowledge with specific less developed countries' cultural and political contexts. By means of a single case study, we were able to ascertain a strong demand for knowledge delivery and the possible benefits of synergetic opportunities. However, the knowledge processes, instruments, and tools at the disposal of globally dispersed teams are insufficient to meet their demands and promote optimal knowledge sharing. Consequently, we propose the implementation of a knowledge center (KC). As a service unit for knowledge management initiatives, such a center could support knowledge-sharing processes by considering a specific team's situational conditions. We present a blueprint for designing such a KC in an international development context.},

abstract = {A rapid increase in the number of questions posted on community question answering (CQA) forums is creating a need for automated methods of question quality moderation to improve the effectiveness of such forums in terms of response time and quality. Such automated approaches should aim to classify questions as good or bad for a particular forum as soon as they are posted based on the guidelines and quality standards defined/listed by the forum. Thus, if a question meets the standard of the forum then it is classified as good else we classify it as bad. In this paper, we propose a method to address this problem of question classification by retrieving similar questions previously asked in the same forum, and then using the text from these previously asked similar questions to predict the quality of the current question. We empirically validate our proposed approach on the set of StackOverflow data, a massive CQA forum for programmers, comprising of about 8M questions. With the use of these additional text retrieved from similar questions, we are able to improve the question quality prediction accuracy by about 2.8\% and improve the recall of negatively scored questions by about 4.2\%. This improvement of 4.2\% in recall would be helpful in automatically flagging questions as bad (unsuitable) for the forum and will speed up the moderation process thus saving time and human effort.},

This survey provides an overview of popular fields (e.g., Viral marketing, influence propagation and social websites) for social network, moreover, introduces representative references, in which the well-known analytical methods and techniques (e.g., Graph theory, data mining techniques and analysis of social network) are briefly described.},

abstract = {IT services need an automatic and flexible ability to react to dynamic changes in their environment. Managing change effectively and reducing the negative effects of day-to-day operations has become one of the most important tasks in IT service management, which require hiring highly skilled IT professionals with correspondingly high labor costs. There is a challenge to select, implement and integrate the right resources quickly and effectively. Although there is a growing body of research into IT management, many techniques are either too narrow (focusing on a single component rather than the entire system), or they address only configuration data collection and integration. Instead, one needs to scale or respond to special domain knowledge, collaboration and the right data for helping IT professionals to improve their work. In this paper, we propose a knowledge-sharing based collaborating management system for IT service management. It aims to bridge the gap between domain experts’ knowledge and manageable systems. We developed a proof-of-concept of an impact analysis service based on knowledge-sharing; it establishes an IT service management collaboration paradigm and ecosystem, leveraging the expert’s rich knowledge and experience to improve the management quality and reduce the cost. A case study driven by customers demonstrates that collaboration with knowledge sharing is effective both at constructing useful system analysis services and in using those services to improve system management.},

A systematic investigation on what questions are asked by programmers, can help us identify potential technical challenges about CaC, and can aid in successful use of CaC tools. The goal of this paper is to help current and potential configuration as code (CaC) adoptees in identifying the challenges related to CaC through an analysis of questions asked by programmers on a major question and answer website. We extract 2,758 Puppet-related questions asked by programmers from January 2010 to December 2016, posted on Stack Overflow. We apply qualitative analysis to identify the questions programmers ask about Puppet. We also investigate the trends in questions with unsatisfactory answers, and changes in question categories over time. From our empirical study, we synthesize 16 major categories of questions. The three most common question categories are: (i) syntax errors, (ii) provisioning instances; and (iii) assessing Puppet's feasibility to accomplish certain tasks. Three categories of questions that yield the most unsatisfactory answers are (i) installation, (ii) security, and (iii) data separation.},

The benefit of collaborating with each other is certainly undeniable, such tools, however, can be a distraction from the actual tasks for learners. The paper presents a study on social media tools supported by various eLearning systems to understand the impact on students learning activities. A survey questionnaire is designed for this purpose. The data is collected from students who have had experience using different massive open online course (MOOC) eLearning platforms and LMS from various universities. The results of the survey indicate that more than 95&nbsp;\% of the participants use at least one of the social tools in their daily life activities, and almost 84&nbsp;\% of them have used these tools in connection with the eLearning systems. It is also interesting to note that 92&nbsp;\% of the participants intend to use social tools for study purposes. The results indicate that there is a need to integrate more of these social media tools into eLearning systems.},

E-WISE blends the recently developed methods for knowledge crowdsourcing acceleration, including 1 an edit suggestion component to improve question quality; 2 a question routing component that suggests a list of ranked answerers. Both components are automatic, and meanwhile enable a human controlling part: askers can make their decisions in selecting the right edits/answerers among the suggested ones, which guarantees the effectiveness of the suggesting components and provides feedback to the suggesting methods. E-WISE will be demonstrated through a case study on Stack Overflow --- a popular QA systems, to exemplify its functions and potential in on-line knowledge creation.},

When proving their properties, a human can often take inspiration from the existing formalized proofs available in other provers or libraries. In this paper we propose and evaluate a number of methods, which strengthen proof automation by learning from proof libraries of different provers. Certain conjectures can be proved directly from the dependencies induced by similar proofs in the other library. Even if exact correspondences are not found, learning-reasoning systems can make use of the association between proved theorems and their characteristics to predict the relevant premises. Such external help can be further combined with internal advice. We evaluate the proposed knowledge-sharing methods by reproving the HOL Light and HOL4 standard libraries. The learning-reasoning system HOLyHammer, whose single best strategy could automatically find proofs for 30\"{\i} \'{z}\% of the HOL Light problems, can prove 40\"{\i} \'{z}\% with the knowledge from HOL4.},

These engines thus require carefully designed queries containing information about programming APIs for code search. Unfortunately, existing studies suggest that preparing an effective query for code search is both challenging and time consuming for the developers. In this paper, we propose a novel code search tool-RACK-that returns relevant source code for a given code search query written in natural language text. The tool first translates the query into a list of relevant API classes by mining keyword-API associations from the crowdsourced knowledge of Stack Overflow, and then applies the reformulated query to GitHub code search API for collecting relevant results. Once a query related to a programming task is submitted, the tool automatically mines relevant code snippets from thousands of open-source projects, and displays them as a ranked list within the context of the developer's programming environment-the IDE.

In this paper, we investigate how Stack Overflow promotes collaboration by allowing users to edit existing questions and answers in order to improve them. Using over 40,000 answer posts, our study reveals that collaboration in answer posts is not a function of achievement earned in terms of badges, as most edits associated with "best answer" rewards were posted by users who have not earned any answer badge. Our study further shows that posts that earned the "best answer" reward have more comments than those that did not. This study though, work in progress, can aid developers in implementing collaboration strategies in social networks that work.},

abstract = {Bug triaging and assignment is a time-consuming task in big projects. Most research in this area examines the developers' prior development and bug-fixing activities in order to recognize their areas of expertise and assign to them relevant bug fixes. We propose a novel method that exploits a new source of evidence for the developers' expertise, namely their contributions to Q&amp;A platforms such as Stack Overflow. We evaluated this method in the context of the 20 largest GitHub projects, considering 7144 bug reports. Our results demonstrate that our method exhibits superior accuracy to other state-of-the-art methods, and that future bug-assignment algorithms should consider exploring other sources of expertise, beyond the project's version-control system and bug tracker.},

Specifically we examined ways in which ‘play’ can be used to enhance collaborative work practices. In this process we elicited subjective views and opinions on playing games and the extent to which the participant’s felt these could enhance their collaboration in work. The ancient Chinese strategy game of Go was employed in an online team version as a means to evaluate and advance the knowledge sharing culture in a network centric environment. The results of this research identified that play has the power to engage participants into the collaborative work practices and that it can provide an opportunity for teams to see the value of sharing information, and hence to improve the knowledge management practices.},

abstract = {Knowledge sharing is an important part in knowledge management. The value of knowledge only can be seen in its transfer, sharing and utilizing. The transfer of individual tacit knowledge to organizational capacity can improve the competitiveness of a organization. However, there are a lot of barriers in knowledge sharing, especially in those knowledge-intensive organizations, where knowledge is very important for individuals to keep advantage, so they are usually unwilling to share it with others, or ‘contribute’ their personal knowledge to the organization. At present, most studies are emphasizing on how to create a good physical environment and platform to improve it. In this paper, we’ll analyze it using game theory. We think that to improve the efficiency of knowledge sharing efficiency, motivation mechanism and physical platform must be improved simultaneously, especially in knowledge-intensive organization, motivation mechanism is more important. Then, to problem of ‘prisoner’ dilemma’ between individuals knowledge sharing, this paper will show how to design motivation method to improve efficiency of it.},

With this kind of service, it is possible to build data visualization applications for different smart devices such as smartphones, tablets, desktop, smart TV's, etc. A Web API that supports the main functionalities of an information visualization tool in different platforms has been proposed to reaches these purposes. The REST (Representational State Transfer) Style has been employed in the service conception as the architectural communication model.

Based on theory of reasoned action and focusing on knowledge sharing setting, we propose that subjective norms and attitudes influence behavioral intention. Three processes drawing from social information processing theory (i.e., internalization, identification, and compliance) are postulated as antecedents of the intention to share knowledge. We also posit that knowledge type (as a moderator) intervenes the forming patterns of sharing behavior. Structural equation modeling was used to test hypotheses. Empirical data are collected from 229 respondents and our arguments were statistically supported. Some theoretical and practical implications are also discussed.},

abstract = {This paper proposes a system that facilitates knowledge sharing among people in similar situations by providing audio of past conversations. Our system records all voices of conversations among the users in the specific fields such as tourist spots, museums, digital fabrication studio, etc. and then timely provides users in a similar situation with fragments of the accumulated conversations. For segmenting and retrieving past conversation from vast amounts of captured data, we focus on non-verbal contextual information, i.e., location, attention targets, and hand operations of the conversation participants. All voices of conversation are recorded, without any selection or classification. The delivery of the voices to a user is determined not based on the content of the conversation but on the similarity of situations between the conversation participants and the user. To demonstrate the concept of the proposed system, we performed a series of experiments to observe changes in user behavior due to past conversations related to the situation at the digital fabrication workshop. Since we have not achieved a satisfactory implementation to sense user's situation, we used Wizard of Oz (WOZ) method. That is, the experimenter visually judges the change in the situation of the user and inputs it to the system, and the system automatically provides the users with voices of past conversation corresponding to the situation. Experimental results show that most of the conversations presented when the situation perfectly matches is related to the user's situation, and some of them prompts the user to change their behavior effectively. Interestingly, we could observe that conversations that were done in the same area but not related to the current task also had the effect of expanding the user's knowledge. We also observed a case that although a conversation highly related to the user's situation was timely presented but the user could not utilize the knowledge to solve the problem of the current task. It shows the limitation of our system, i.e., even if a knowledgeable conversation is timely provided, it is useless unless it fits with the user's knowledge level.},

However, pair programming is not popularly used in K-12. One important issue is because sometimes pair programming by K-12 students is not as effective as expected. This study examines whether pair programming is effective from cognitive load perspective in distributed situation. We compares the cognitive loads for the visual programming language, called Star Logo TNG, under three circumstances that is alone, pair programming, and distributed pair programming. The experimental results show that learners prefer traditional pair programming to alone. Moreover, the pair programming can reduce germane cognitive load significantly. However, there is no significant difference between the single and distributed pair programming. Meanwhile, there is no significant difference on learning performance between traditional and distributed pair programming. Those results indicate the learning support and knowledge sharing tools for distributed pair programming could be improved.},

abstract = {Software developers frequently solve development issues with the help of question and answer web forums, such as Stack Overflow (SO). While tags exist to support question searching and browsing, they are more related to technological aspects than to the question purposes. Tagging questions with their purpose can add a new dimension to the investigation of topics discussed in posts on SO. In this paper, we aim to automate such a classification of SO posts into seven question categories. As a first step, we have manually created a curated data set of 500 SO posts, classified into the seven categories. Using this data set, we apply machine learning algorithms (Random Forest and Support Vector Machines) to build a classification model for SO questions. We then experiment with 82 different configurations regarding the preprocessing of the text and representation of the input data. The results of the best performing models show that our models can classify posts into the correct question category with an average precision and recall of 0.88 and 0.87 when using Random Forest and the phrases indicating a question category as input data for the training. The obtained model can be used to aid developers in browsing SO discussions or researchers in building recommenders based on SO.},

According to the data, social networks, performance-based reward systems, and employee usage of IT applications are significant variables affecting employee knowledge sharing activities in the public and private organizations that were the focus of this study. Furthermore, the data show that while IT application usage is the most important factor determining employee knowledge sharing capabilities in the five government ministries, an end-user IT focus is the most important factor influencing knowledge sharing abilities in the five private-sector corporations. The results also indicate that the surveyed private sector employees have stronger perceptions of knowledge sharing abilities in their organizations compared to the surveyed public sector employees. Lessons and implications of this study for management leadership are presented.},

However, there are few Chinese-English knowledge bases due to the following reasons: 1) the scarcity of Chinese knowledge in existing cross-lingual knowledge bases; 2) the limited number of cross-lingual links; 3) the incorrect relationships in semantic taxonomy. In this paper, a large-scale Cross-Lingual Knowledge Base(named XLORE) is built to address the above problems. Particularly, XLORE integrates four online wikis including English Wikipedia, Chinese Wikipedia, Baidu Baike and Hudong Baike to balance the knowledge volume in different languages, employs a link-discovery method to augment the cross-lingual links, and introduces a pruning approach to refine taxonomy. Totally, XLORE harvests 663,740 classes, 56,449 properties, and 10,856,042 instances, among of which, 507,042 entities are cross-lingually linked. At last, we provide an online cross-lingual knowledge base system supporting two ways to access established XLORE, namely a search engine and a SPARQL endpoint.},

abstract = {Community Question Answering (CQA) portals provide rich sources of information on a variety of topics. However, the authenticity and quality of questions and answers (Q&amp;As) has proven hard to control. In a troubling direction, the widespread growth of crowdsourcing websites has created a large-scale, potentially difficult-to-detect workforce to manipulate malicious contents in CQA. The crowd workers who join the same crowdsourcing task about promotion campaigns in CQA collusively manipulate deceptive Q&amp;As for promoting a target (product or service). The collusive spamming group can fully control the sentiment of the target. How to utilize the structure and the attributes for detecting manipulated Q&amp;As? How to detect the collusive group and leverage the group information for the detection task?To shed light on these research questions, we propose a unified framework to tackle the challenge of detecting collusive spamming activities of CQA. First, we interpret the questions and answers in CQA as two independent networks. Second, we detect collusive question groups and answer groups from these two networks respectively by measuring the similarity of the contents posted within a short duration. Third, using attributes (individual-level and group-level) and correlations (user-based and content-based), we proposed a combined factor graph model to detect deceptive Q&amp;As simultaneously by combining two independent factor graphs. With a large-scale practical data set, we find that the proposed framework can detect deceptive contents at early stage, and outperforms a number of competitive baselines.},

This developed ontology supports the knowledge sharing, evaluation and review of the protocols used, contributing to the tactical and strategic planning of organizations. The construction of the ontology was based on the methodology Methontology. The domain specification and conceptualization were based in qualitative research, in which were extracted 131 terms with definitions, of which 85 were assessed by specialists. From there, in the Prot\'{e}g\'{e} tool, the domain's taxonomy and the axioms were created. The specialists validated the ontology using the assessment by human approach (taxonomy, application and structure). Thus, a sustainable ontology model to the rescue tactical phase was ensured.},

abstract = {Existing scientific workflow tools, created by computer scientists, require that domain scientists meticulously design their multi-step experiments before analyzing data. However, this is oftentimes contradictory to a domain scientist's routine of conducting research and exploration. This paper presents a novel way to resolve this dispute, in the context of service-oriented science. After scrutinizing how Earth scientists conduct data analytics research in their daily work, a provenance model is developed to record their activities. Reverse-engineering the provenance, a technology is developed to automatically generate workflows for scientists to review and revise, supported by a Petri nets-based workflow verification instrument. In addition, dataset is proposed to be treated as first-class citizen to drive the knowledge sharing and recommendation. A data-centric repository infrastructure is established to catch richer provenance to further facilitate collaboration in the science community. In this way, we aim to revolutionize computer-supported Earth science.},

The learning resources contain three categories, namely learning collaborators, content, and services. This seamless learning environment aimed for knowledge sharing in collaboration supported virtual learning communities. Content found by peer-to-peer network refers to the sources of explicit knowledge; while the discussion and interaction details recorded in instant messenger network is the source of tacit knowledge. Interaction occurred in social network can be biparties communication, message exchange, file sharing, and knowledge sharing. Results of this study demonstrate that the applied knowledge sharing mechanism helps learning collaborators find right content and related knowledgeable collaborators who are willing to share their knowledge.},

abstract = {In order to use technology to influence human behaviour and promote safer and more fuel efficient behaviour through incentive mechanisms, an instrumented vehicle is developed. The first step is to make it “perceive” the outside world, so extracting knowledge from some data sources such as sensors is crucial. More critically, there is a fundamental need for a standard that would enable knowledge sharing/exchanging among the different entities, e.g., between on-board sensors, in-vehicle controls and traffic management agencies. This paper proposes an Ontology for Context Modelling (OCM) to be used as the world model for driving context representation and reasoning, which can enable a better understanding of traffic context and sensor capability, which is the basis for providing data source to Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS), V2X (Vehicle-to-Everything) communications and even driving decision making within autonomous vehicles. Through the experiments, we evaluate the capability of the OCM to represent the driving context and the reasoning mechanism to compensate for sensor failures and recognize lane changing and overtaking events. This methodology has significant value for creating standards in autonomous and semi-autonomous cars.},

abstract = {With the proliferation of online developer forums as informal documentation, developers often share their opinions about the APIs they use. However, given the plethora of opinions available for an API in various online developer forums, it can be challenging for a developer to make informed decisions about the APIs. While automatic summarization of opinions have been explored for other domains (e.g., cameras, cars), we found little research that investigates the benefits of summaries of public API reviews. In this paper, we present two algorithms (statistical and aspect-based) to summarize opinions about APIs. To investigate the usefulness of the techniques, we developed, Opiner, an online opinion summarization engine that presents summaries of opinions using both our proposed techniques and existing six off-the-shelf techniques. We investigated the usefulness of Opiner using two case studies, both involving professional software engineers. We found that developers were interested to use our proposed summaries much more frequently than other summaries (daily vs once a year) and that while combined with Stack Overflow, Opiner helped developers to make the right decision with more accuracy and confidence and in less time.},

At first, according to the methodology of PLIB (ISO 13584), a common ontology--PLIB ontology was put forward which provide a coherent conceptual meaning within the context of CPC domain. Meanwhile, for the sake of knowledge intercommunion via internet, the PLIB ontology formalization description by EXPRESS mode was converted into XML Schema, and two mapping methods were presented: direct mapping approach and meta-levels mapping approach, while the latter was adopted. Based on above work, a parts resource knowledge-sharing framework (CPC-KSF) was put forward and realized, which has been applied in the process of automotive component manufacturing collaborative product commerce.},

Traditional information security management models tend to concentrate on the technological viewpoint to secure existing information assets. However, the use of contemporary approaches for knowledge creation and sharing offer new important possibilities for making use of internal and external knowledge. Simultaneously, their implementation involves changes in technologies, as well as a change in work processes and communications. Hence, knowledge security risk management should be developed from the current focus on relatively static containers and information assets toward more proactive management of the potential future risks of knowledge sharing. This paper introduces a proactive process for managing knowledge security risks and reports experiences of its use by professionals with experience in various topics of information and knowledge security.},

abstract = {While deep learning is an exciting new technique, the benefits of this method need to be assessed with respect to its computational cost. This is particularly important for deep learning since these learners need hours (to weeks) to train the model. Such long training time limits the ability of (a)~a researcher to test the stability of their conclusion via repeated runs with different random seeds; and (b)~other researchers to repeat, improve, or even refute that original work.  For example, recently, deep learning was used to find which questions in the Stack Overflow programmer discussion forum can be linked together. That deep learning system took 14 hours to execute. We show here that applying a very simple optimizer called DE to fine tune SVM, it can achieve similar (and sometimes better) results. The DE approach terminated in 10 minutes; i.e. 84 times faster hours than deep learning method.  We offer these results as a cautionary tale to the software analytics community and suggest that not every new innovation should be applied without critical analysis. If researchers deploy some new and expensive process, that work should be baselined against some simpler and faster alternatives.},

This paper presents our tool SimilarTech (https://graphofknowledge.appspot.com/similartech) that makes it possible to automatically recommend analogical libraries by incorporating tag embeddings and domain-specific relational and categorical knowledge mined from Stack Overflow. SimilarTech currently supports recommendation of 6,715 libraries across 6 different programming languages. We release our SimilarTech website for public use. The SimilarTech website attracts more than 2,400 users in the past 6 months.

Although new technologies in maintenance have been studied extensively, their usage is still lacking in the industry. We have studied knowledge-sharing solutions using augmented reality (AR) and wearable technologies in actual industry cases to find out if maintenance technicians find them useful and usable in their everyday work. Two test cases were included: the use of a wearable system consisting of three devices in the crane industry, and the use of AR guidance in the marine industry. In both cases two maintenance technicians tested the technologies and data were collected using questionnaires, interviews and observation. The maintenance technicians were positive towards the use of these technologies in their work. However, some practical issues were raised concerning the simultaneous use of multiple devices and the placement of the devices. A more system-level approach to designing wearable and AR technologies could be applied to ensure their utility in the field. Findings from this study can be used when designing and implementing wearable and AR technologies in maintenance, but also in other industry domains like the manufacturing industry.},

In light of these issues, we proposed a tri-modal deep boltzmann machine (tri-DBM) to extract unified representation for query, question and answer. Experiments on Yahoo!

In this exploratory study, we consider employee's willingness to knowledge share as the dependent variable. Our survey-based research of two large IT service and consulting organizations was aimed at examining cultural, technological, motivational, and organizational factors, which influence knowledge sharing within an organization from a non-executive employee's perspective. Study results showed that issues relating to the availability and usability of technology, leadership support and motivating structures were shown to have influences on knowledge sharing. The study also revealed that employee's willingness to share knowledge was not reduced by their concerns about the loss of power or job insecurity. We recommend that this research can be expanded to different types of organizations to understand influencing factors of knowledge sharing from an employee perspective with independent variables such as discipline, geographical location, organization size, and type.},

abstract = {In today's fast growing IT industry many companies are constantly experiencing shortages of software developers, a key resource in the computer-based world that we live in. This frustrating reality comes from the fact that training a competitive software developer is a long process that may take years which is incompatible with the much faster ups and downs of the software industry. As a consequence many managers from software development and consulting companies are attempting to accelerate the process of training software developers. The current article presents an example of knowledge sharing practice in which young graduates have been trained as ABAP programmers with the help of an accelerated knowledge sharing method that has enabled them to reach in only 4-6 months a level of expertise that has made them acceptable for top system integrators. Traditionally, for reaching such a level there would have been necessary almost 2 years of training on the job. The article focuses on the architecture of the knowledge sharing system and the roles of the persons involved. A simplified mathematical model of the success rate is also described. As a conclusion the article demonstrates that the time needed to acquire expertise as an ABAP programmer can be reduced from 2 years to 4-6 months with the help of knowledge sharing methods.},

abstract = {Students' performance in Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) is enhanced by high quality discussion forums or recently emerging educational Community Question Answering (CQA) systems. Nevertheless, only a small number of students answer questions asked by their peers. This results in instructor overload, and many unanswered questions. To increase students' participation, we present an approach for recommendation of new questions to students who are likely to provide answers. Existing approaches to such question routing proposed for non-educational CQA systems tend to rely on a few experts, what is not applicable in educational domain where it is important to involve all kinds of students. In tackling this novel educational question routing problem, our method (1) goes beyond previous question-answering data as it incorporates additional non-QA data from the course (to improve prediction accuracy and to involve more of the student community) and (2) applies constraints on users' workload (to prevent user overloading). We use an ensemble classifier for predicting students' willingness to answer a question, as well as students' expertise for answering. We conducted an online evaluation of the proposed method using an A/B experiment in our CQA system deployed in edX MOOC. The proposed method outperformed a baseline method (non-educational question routing enhanced with workload restriction) by improving recommendation accuracy, keeping more community members active, and increasing an average number of their contributions.},

abstract = {Software developers commonly rely on well-known software architecture patterns, such as MVC, to build their applications. In many of these patterns, classes play specific roles in the system, such as Controllers or Entities, which means that each of these classes has specific characteristics in terms of object-oriented class design and implementation. Indeed, as we have shown in a previous study, architectural roles are different from each other in terms of code metrics. In this paper, we present a study in a software development company in which we captured developers' perceptions on object-oriented design aspects of the architectural roles in their system and whether these perceptions match the source code metric analysis. We found that their developers do not have a common perception of how their architectural roles behave in terms of object-oriented design aspects, and that their perceptions also do not match the results of the source code metric analysis. This phenomenon also does not seem to be related to developers' experience. We find these results alarming, and thus, we suggest software development teams to invest in education and knowledge sharing about how their system's architectural roles behave.},

abstract = {Main focus of this paper is placed on team creativity. In order for an organization to remain competitive, team creativity level should be controlled to stay higher than an average level that rival companies are believed to show. Beyond managers' control, we emphasize a voluntarily and informally emergent structure and introduce a social network perspective within team creativity. Since a team is composed of individual members, and a certain kind of leadership and trust exist in the team to affect team creativity, it is necessary to investigate relationships between leadership, trust and team creativity in a rigorous way. In this sense, we propose a team creativity model in which shared leadership, interpersonal trust (affect-based trust and cognition-based trust), and knowledge-sharing are included and their subsequent influence on team creativity is analyzed. For the sake of empirical analysis, an e-learning course was administered in a private university, and 40 teams were organized for this study. 249 valid questionnaires were garnered, and analyzed by structural equation model. Results show that shared leadership, knowledge sharing and cognition-based trust significantly influence team creativity.},

These explicit feedback mechanisms can be viewed as noisy measurements of both information reliability and information source trustworthiness. Can we leverage these noisy measurements, often biased, to distill a robust, unbiased and interpretable measure of both notions?In this paper, we argue that the large volume of digital traces left by the users within knowledge repositories also reflect information reliability and source trustworthiness. In particular, we propose a temporal point process modeling framework which links the temporal behavior of the users to information reliability and source trustworthiness. Furthermore, we develop an efficient convex optimization procedure to learn the parameters of the model from historical traces of the evaluations provided by these users. Experiments on real-world data gathered from Wikipedia and Stack Overflow show that our modeling framework accurately predicts evaluation events, provides an interpretable measure of information reliability and source trustworthiness, and yields interesting insights about real-world events.},

Reducing the constraints to communication and knowledge sharing of a globally distributed workforce, will facilitate the workflow. People finder systems are one of the main solutions in enterprise social networks which are reducing these constraints leading to time and cost savings. Finding expertise efficiently helps organizations to unlock knowledge within the enterprise, solve problems, and identify collaborators. However, the following challenges still exist: validating expertise, determining responsiveness and accessibility, and managing expert profiles. In this paper, we propose the fuzzy OWA technique as a novel approach to ranking candidates in expertise search. We consider its application in open innovation intermediaries where the search for partners and expertise is at the center of the business model. In addition, we demonstrate its application in a software tool (InsERT) as part of a larger enterprise social network implementation.},

Stack Exchange (SE) is one such successful community which is a collection of various domain-specific forums, each acting as an independent community in itself. In this paper, we undertake a comparative measurement study across a large number of these domain-specific forums within Stack Exchange. We analyse a number of user activity-based features of each forum and try to cluster different forums based on their similarities on this feature set. For our study, we model Stack Exchange as an Across "Forum Graph" based on inter-forum similarity, and its individual forums as: (a) A user-to-user graph (question asker-answerer) (b) A bipartite graph between questions and answerers, and (c) A bipartite graph between questions and answers. Through these graphs we present a measurement study of Stack Exchange which focuses on the similarities and differences between various forums based on the patterns of user activity on them. The clusters obtained give a high level idea of similar forums based on common users and content. We observe that communities can be classified as "discussion-based" and "fact-based" and further we classify forums on the basis of question answering patterns.},

abstract = {Search as a dialogue is an emerging paradigm that is fueled by the proliferation of mobile devices and technological advances, e.g. in speech recognition and natural language processing. Such an interface allows search systems to engage in a dialogue with users aimed at fulfilling their information needs. One key capability required to make such search dialogues effective is asking clarification questions (CLARQ) proactively, when a user's intent is not clear, which could help the system provide more useful responses. With this in mind, we explore the dialogues between the users on a community question answering (CQA) website as a rich repository of information-seeking interactions. In particular, we study the clarification questions asked by CQA users in two different domains, analyze their behavior, and the types of clarification questions asked. Our results suggest that the types of CLARQ are very diverse, while the questions themselves tend to be specific and require both domain- and general knowledge. However, focusing on popular CLARQ types and domains can be fruitful. As a first step towards automatic generation of clarification questions, we explore the problem of predicting the specific subject of a clarification question. Our findings can be useful for future improvements of intelligent dialog search and question answering systems.},

Ultimately, this research is aimed at understanding whether or not such online information and knowledge sharing can influence attitude change towards IT occupations using inoculation methods to ultimately attract them to the field. In this paper, we discuss existing literature of IT occupations, their culture and functions, the online information and knowledge sharing through social networking, and attitude change using inoculation as a method of persuasion. We describe our current efforts to create online communities of potential newcomers and those who are already part of the occupation, followed by presentation of the type of information that is intended to be shared.},

abstract = {Collaborative and distributed business process elicitation may lead to a loss of quality and productivity in the construction of the business model if, in the moment of the interview, the analyst ignore relevant information obtained by other analysts. This paper proposes a context model that organizes information to be shared among analysts at the moment interviews are conducted. To validate the proposed model we conducted a case study that involved elicitation sessions and the use of a prototype of a support tool. We conclude that the application of the model using an elicitation tool is feasible, enabling knowledge sharing among analysts during the collaborative process elicitation, complementing the analyst's understanding, anticipating doubts, conflicts and ambiguities.},

abstract = {Community Question Answering (CQA) services, such as Yahoo! Answers and WikiAnswers, have become popular with users as one of the central paradigms for satisfying users' information needs. The task of question retrieval aims to resolve one's query directly by finding the most relevant questions (together with their answers) from an archive of past questions. However, as the text of each question is short, there is usually a lexical gap between the queried question and the past questions. To alleviate this problem, we present a hybrid approach that blends several language modelling techniques for question retrieval, namely, the classic (query-likelihood) language model, the state-of-the-art translation-based language model, and our proposed semantics-based language model. The semantics of each candidate question is given by a probabilistic topic model which makes use of local and global semantic graphs for capturing the hidden interactions among entities (e.g., people, places, and concepts) in question-answer pairs. Experiments on two real-world datasets show that our approach can significantly outperform existing ones.},

abstract = {Knowledge management (KM) is essential for success in any software project, but especially in global software development where team members are separated by time and space. Software organizations are managing knowledge in various ways to increase transparency and improve software team performance. One way to classify these strategies is proposed by Earl who defined seven knowledge management schools. The objective of this research is to study knowledge creation and sharing practices in a number of distributed agile projects, map these practices to the knowledge management strategies and determine which strategies are most common, which are applied only locally and which are applied globally. This is done by conducting a series of semi-structured qualitative interviews over a period of time span during May, 2012-June, 2013. Our results suggest that knowledge sharing across remote locations in distributed agile projects heavily relies on knowledge codification, i.e. Technocratic KM strategies, even when the same knowledge is shared tacitly within the same location, i.e. Through behavioral KM strategies.},

This study uses a supply chain management (SCM) game to define effective strategies for decision making in a SC. The game rules and system architecture should be simple but should capture the true SCM nature. For this purpose, our developed SCM game applies an unbalanced social networking service system platform. In contrast to previous business games, the game is accessible through mobile devices such as smart phones. The new SCM game was tested at two universities, and most of the students spontaneously grasped the bullwhip effect and the importance of knowledge sharing between SC organizations. Furthermore, their realization of various difficulties in a SC exceeded our expectations. In addition to offering educational benefits, our game could become an important tool in future SC research.},

abstract = {Background. C# maintains type safety and security by not allowing direct dangerous pointer arithmetic. To improve performance for special cases, pointer arithmetic is provided via an unsafe context. Programmers can use the C# unsafe keyword to encapsulate a code block, which can use pointer arithmetic. In the Common Language Runtime (CLR), unsafe code is referred to as unverifiable code. It then becomes the responsibility of the programmer to ensure the encapsulated code snippet is not dangerous. Naturally, this raises concern on whether such trust is misused by programmers when they promote the use of C# unsafe context. Aim. We aim to analyze the prevalence and vulnerabilities of share code examples using C# unsafe keyword in Stack Overflow (SO) code sharing platform. Method. By using some regular expressions and manual checks, we extracted C# unsafe code relevant posts from SO and categorized them into some software development scenarios. Results. In the entire SO data dump of September 2018, we find 2,283 C# snippets with the unsafe keyword. Among those posts, 27\% of posts are about Image processing, where unsafe codes are mainly used for performance reasons. The second most popular category by 21\% of the codes in the posts is used for 'Interoperability' reasons. That is 'unsafe' is used to enable 'Interoperability' between C# managed codes and unmanaged codes. The 'stackalloc' operator is the third category with 9\% of unsafe code posts. The stackalloc operator allocates a block of memory on the stack. Since C# 7.2, Microsoft recommends against using 'stackalloc' in unsafe context whenever possible. Manual inspection shows 67 code snippets with dangerous functions that can introduce vulnerability if not used with caution (e.g., buffer overflow). Finally, 35\% of 'Interoperability' posts have 'P/Invoke' tag were used outside NativeMethods class, which is in contrast to Microsoft design suggestion. Conclusion. Our study leads to 7 main findings, and these findings show the importance of cautiously using this feature.},

We study the dialogues captured in the Software Configuration Management (SCM) tool used by a global SM organization and use Pajek, a Social Network Analysis (SNA) tool, to map the interactions among users and maintenance personnel. The results revealed technical, planning and domain information as most shared information. Network bottlenecks are also identified, which evolves around a key development manager, a development team leader and a systems analyst. Also, there are lack of direct interactions between programmers and domain knowledge providers. As such, the SM environment could benefit from process automations on selected tasks of the above bottleneck areas to ensure knowledge are shared across the board.},

This rapid growth, while offering new opportunities, puts forward new challenges. In most CQA implementations there is little effort in directing new questions to the right group of experts. This means that experts are not provided with questions matching their expertise, and therefore new matching questions may be missed and not receive a proper answer. We focus on finding experts for a newly posted question. We investigate the suitability of two statistical topic models for solving this issue and compare these methods against more traditional Information Retrieval approaches. We show that for a dataset constructed from the Stackoverflow website, these topic models outperform other methods in retrieving a candidate set of best experts for a question. We also show that the Segmented Topic Model gives consistently better performance compared to the Latent Dirichlet Allocation Model.},

One such task, in which the received votes are directly used as graded relevance assessment values, is ranking replies of a question. Even though these available assessments values are very practical for evaluation purposes, they may not always reflect the correct assessment value of the content, due to the possible temporal or presentation bias introduced by the CQA system during voting process. This paper analyzes a very commonly used CQA data collection in terms of these introduced biases and their effects on the experimental evaluation of approaches. A more bias free test set construction approach, which has correlated results with the manual assessments, is also proposed in this paper.},

Indeed, they are often used as internal documentation for various in-house systems and applications as well as powerful tools for collaboration and knowledge sharing. As occurs with software, the fundamental growth of a wiki may lead to its degradation. The quality of wikis, especially in enterprise contexts, should not play a trivial role. Software quality is a very discussed topic, but there are not many studies regarding the quality of wikis. We propose a probabilistic model to represent wikis and to investigate their quality. Due to the similarity with the World Wide Web it is natural to consider the popular Google PageRank (with minor modifications) to calculate probabilities between pages. Each wiki category, a set of wiki pages, is modelled using the PRISM language in order to verify specific properties in PCTL*. Experiments conducted on a adequate number of (enterprise) wikis assess the validity of our methodology.},

abstract = {Managing and understanding the growing volumes of scientific data is one of the most challenging issues scientists face today. As analyses get more complex and large interdisciplinary groups need to work together, knowledge sharing becomes essential to support effective scientific data exploration. While science portals and visualization Web sites have provided a first step towards this goal, by aggregating data from different sources and providing a set of predesigned analyses and visualizations, they have important limitations. Often, these sites are built manually and are not flexible enough to support the vast heterogeneity of data sources, analysis techniques, data products, and the needs of different user communities. In this paper we describe CrowdLabs, a system that adopts the model used by social Web sites, allowing users to share not only data but also computational pipelines. The shared repository opens up many new opportunities for knowledge sharing and re-use, exposing scientists to tasks that provide examples of sophisticated uses of algorithms they would not have access to otherwise. CrowdLabs combines a set of usable tools and a scalable infrastructure to provide a rich collaborative environment for scientists, taking into account the requirements of computational scientists, such as accessing high-performance computers and manipulating large amounts of data.},

A new measure of expertise based on regret evaluation is proposed. Regret measure takes uncertainty bounds of two best actions, i.e. the greedy action and the second best action into account. Knowledge sharing simulations and experiments on real robots were performed to compare the effectiveness of the three expertness measures i.e. Gradient (G), Average Move (AM) and our proposed measure. The proposed measure exhibited the best performance among the three measures. Moreover, our measure that is applied to the AdpWSS does not require the predefined setting of cooperative time, thus it is more practical to be implemented in real-world problems.},

We then analyzed evidence for knowledge gaps between stakeholders, such as misunderstanding systems and business aspects, which hinder CR delivery. For each gap we mapped related risks and proposed methods, taken from advanced information system development (ISD) methodologies focused on human, collaborative and knowledge aspects, as mitigation strategies. Our analysis indicates that these methods, which encourage collaboration and knowledge sharing, can serve as feasible mitigation strategies for the knowledge gaps found in the study.

abstract = {We aim at summarizing answers in community question-answering (CQA). While most previous work focuses on factoid question-answering, we focus on the non-factoid question-answering. Unlike factoid CQA, non-factoid question-answering usually requires passages as answers. The shortness, sparsity and diversity of answers form interesting challenges for summarization. To tackle these challenges, we propose a sparse coding-based summarization strategy that includes three core ingredients: short document expansion, sentence vectorization, and a sparse-coding optimization framework. Specifically, we extend each answer in a question-answering thread to a more comprehensive representation via entity linking and sentence ranking strategies. From answers extended in this manner, each sentence is represented as a feature vector trained from a short text convolutional neural network model. We then use these sentence representations to estimate the saliency of candidate sentences via a sparse-coding framework that jointly considers candidate sentences and Wikipedia sentences as reconstruction items. Given the saliency vectors for all candidate sentences, we extract sentences to generate an answer summary based on a maximal marginal relevance algorithm. Experimental results on a benchmark data collection confirm the effectiveness of our proposed method in answer summarization of non-factoid CQA, and moreover, its significant improvement compared to state-of-the-art baselines in terms of ROUGE metrics.},

abstract = {Prior research has examined the use of Social Question and Answer (Q&amp;A) websites for answer and help seeking. However, the potential for these websites to support domain learning has not yet been realized. Helping users write effective answers can be beneficial for subject area learning for both answerers and the recipients of answers. In this study, we examine the utility of crowdsourced, criteria-based feedback for answerers on a student-centered Q&amp;A website, Brainly.com. In an experiment with 55 users, we compared perceptions of the current rating system against two feedback designs with explicit criteria (Appropriate, Understandable, and Generalizable). Contrary to our hypotheses, answerers disagreed with and rejected the criteria-based feedback. Although the criteria aligned with answerers' goals, and crowdsourced ratings were found to be objectively accurate, the norms and expectations for answers on Brainly conflicted with our design. We conclude with implications for the design of feedback in social Q&amp;A.},

A high degree of collaboration and knowledge sharing is required to take a system from business concept to production implementation in complex organizations where numerous teams are involved in the software engineering process. Much of historical knowledge management strategy has a technology focus with knowledge collected, organized, and disseminated with a push or pull approach. An approach that considers common technology implementations, such as intranets, document management systems, and email, and how those can be exploited with little or no introduction of new processes or tools to promote knowledge sharing is suggested. Human and social aspects are considered fundamental to the success of a solution that leverages current technology implementations and capitalizes on the relationships that exist and are created among individuals in the context of software engineering work.},

abstract = {Sentiment analysis has various application scenarios in software engineering (SE), such as detecting developers' emotions in commit messages and identifying their opinions on Q&amp;A forums. However, commonly used out-of-the-box sentiment analysis tools cannot obtain reliable results on SE tasks and the misunderstanding of technical jargon is demonstrated to be the main reason. Then, researchers have to utilize labeled SE-related texts to customize sentiment analysis for SE tasks via a variety of algorithms. However, the scarce labeled data can cover only very limited expressions and thus cannot guarantee the analysis quality. To address such a problem, we turn to the easily available emoji usage data for help. More specifically, we employ emotional emojis as noisy labels of sentiments and propose a representation learning approach that uses both Tweets and GitHub posts containing emojis to learn sentiment-aware representations for SE-related texts. These emoji-labeled posts can not only supply the technical jargon, but also incorporate more general sentiment patterns shared across domains. They as well as labeled data are used to learn the final sentiment classifier. Compared to the existing sentiment analysis methods used in SE, the proposed approach can achieve significant improvement on representative benchmark datasets. By further contrast experiments, we find that the Tweets make a key contribution to the power of our approach. This finding informs future research not to unilaterally pursue the domain-specific resource, but try to transform knowledge from the open domain through ubiquitous signals such as emojis.},

abstract = {Commercial-off-the-Shelf (COTS) systems continue to evolve after acquisition while adapting to an ever-changing organizational environment. Many software changes are delivered through the change request (CR) knowledge-intensive process that can be viewed as a small development cycle. In this study we mapped COTS-related risks documented in literature to COTS-based systems development (CBSD) phases. We then analyzed evidence for knowledge gaps between stakeholders, such as misunderstanding systems and business aspects, which hinder CR delivery. For each gap we mapped related risks and proposed methods, taken from advanced information system development (ISD) methodologies focused on human, collaborative and knowledge aspects, as mitigation strategies. Our analysis indicates that these methods, which encourage collaboration and knowledge sharing, can serve as feasible mitigation strategies for the knowledge gaps found in the study. Taking a knowledge-centric perspective of the CBSD process by mitigating risks via human-centric development methods is the first step toward a new model for risk management in CBSD.},

abstract = {One of the major challenges for automated question answering over Knowledge Bases (KBQA) is translating a natural language question to the Knowledge Base (KB) entities and predicates. Previous systems have used a limited amount of training data to learn a lexicon that is later used for question answering. This approach does not make use of other potentially relevant text data, outside the KB, which could supplement the available information. We introduce a new system, Text2KB, that enriches question answering over a knowledge base by using external text data. Specifically, we revisit different phases in the KBQA process and demonstrate that text resources improve question interpretation, candidate generation and ranking. Building on a state-of-the-art traditional KBQA system, Text2KB utilizes web search results, community question answering and general text document collection data, to detect question topic entities, map question phrases to KB predicates, and to enrich the features of the candidates derived from the KB. Text2KB significantly improves performance over the baseline KBQA method, as measured on a popular WebQuestions dataset. The results and insights developed in this work can guide future efforts on combining textual and structured KB data for question answering.},

Hence, it becomes critical to understand and design mechanisms that are effective to motivate user contributions. This paper studies the effects of two mechanisms, virtual rewards and reputation, on the quantity and quality of user contributions in online community. We analyze user-level panel data from a representative knowledge sharing platform Stack Exchange.com, and investigate whether these two mechanisms improve the quantity and quality of user contributions. Surprisingly, we find that a user's reputation does not directly motivate contribution. It is the relative reputation (ranking) that serves as the motivation. This finding highlights the importance of peer effect and social comparison in the incentive design of open collaboration platforms. Our study provides implications for platform designers on how to motivate community participants and build sustainable online knowledge communities.},

abstract = {As a good user interface design is important for the success of an app, so is a good API for the success of a Web service. Within the RESTful Web services community there is a need for a systematic approach in knowledge sharing, for which patterns are particularly suitable. Using a RESTful service to achieve a certain goal often requires multiple client-server interactions, i.e., to have a conversation. While patterns of such RESTful conversations can be uncovered from existing APIs' usage scenarios, or the service engineering literature, they have never been gathered in a pattern language, nor properly visualized with a Domain Specific Modeling Language (DSML). These patterns provide valuable input for API designers, as well as API consumers, by establishing a common vocabulary to describe recurring conversations. To do so, this paper uses RESTalk, a DSML, to model the basic RESTful conversation patterns structured around the life cycle of a resource (create, discover, read, edit, delete, protect) by showing the corresponding sequences of HTTP request-response interactions. We show how the resulting pattern language can be applied to individual resources, or also collections of resources.},

abstract = {Community Question Answering (CQA) sites have become valuable repositories that host a massive volume of human knowledge. How can we detect a high-value answer which clears the doubts of many users? Can we tell the user if the question s/he is posting would attract a good answer? In this paper, we aim to answer these questions from the perspective of the voting outcome by the site users. Our key observation is that the voting score of an answer is strongly positively correlated with that of its question, and such correlation could be in turn used to boost the prediction performance. Armed with this observation, we propose a family of algorithms to jointly predict the voting scores of questions and answers soon after they are posted in the CQA sites. Experimental evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of our approaches.},

Our analysis highlights how a current reliance on peers and informal networks relates to a desire to establish the authenticity and relatability of another person's experience to one's own circumstances. This connects to a perceived mistrust in information where provenance and authenticity is not clear.

Moreover, since many online communities allow their users to embed images within their messages, it is interesting to find out how people use images to share tacit knowledge online. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to investigate the image usage and tacit knowledge sharing in online communities. The research method used in this study was content analysis. The findings suggest that online community users embed digital images in their messages to aid their tacit knowledge sharing.},

How are standards set for content inclusion, and what mechanisms are used to find and remove content deemed inappropriate by the community? The subject of vandalism, or the malicious addition of "bad" content, has been widely studied. Here, he focuses on content added in good faith that has nevertheless been judged inappropriate for the specific community. He also explores the possibility of using various automated tools to assist humans in gatekeeping tasks.},

abstract = {The use of social spaces design in social computing has created an economic value in the preservation of cultural heritage. This movement has now motivated the museum community to provide a systematic establishment to support the digital cultural heritage preservation through e-museum. However some of the cultural heritage community knowledge sharing drivers has not been adequately addressed. The significant growth of community based concept shows a great economic importance in producing reliable digital object repositories. We developed a conceptual framework of a community based e-museum (ComE) to facilitate the design of community knowledge sharing in as an attempt to solve the economic issues of sustaining a cultural heritage information system [1]. In this paper we further elaborate the framework by presenting the structural knowledge modeling of the subsystem of the ComE framework within the social technical system frame based on four components of community views. We demonstrate the instantiation by using the traditional Malay textile (TMT) as the cultural artifact as the case study.},

title = {Two datasets of questions and answers for studying the development of cross-platform mobile applications using Xamarin framework},
year = {2019},
publisher = {IEEE Press},
abstract = {A cross-platform mobile application is an application that runs on multiple mobile platforms (Android, iOS). Several frameworks have been proposed to simplify the development of cross-platform mobile applications and, therefore, to reduce development and maintenance costs. Between them, cross-compiler mobile development frameworks, such as Xamarin from Microsoft, transform the application's code written in intermediate (aka non-native) language to native code for each target platform (Android, iOS). However, to our best knowledge, there is not much research about the advantages and disadvantages of the use of those frameworks during the development and maintenance phases of mobile applications.The objective of this paper is to present two datasets of questions and answers (Q \&amp; A) related to the development of mobile applications using Xamarin. Our datasets have 85,908 questions mined from the Xamarin Forum and 44,434 from Stack Overflow.To show their usefulness, we present two experiments. First, we replicate a study for discovering the main discussion topics of Xamarin development present in the two datasets using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), and we compare them with topics previously reported about mobile development. Between the main topics discovered from those questions, we found that some of them are exclusively related to Xamarin and Microsoft technologies such as the design pattern 'MVVM'. Secondly, we aim at improving the official Xamarin documentation, which does not provide a complete description of the error codes that the Xamarin platform throws during development. We use our datasets of Q \&amp; A for complementing the error codes with information mined from accepted answers. We could complement the documentation of 23,9\% of the error codes.},

And we developed a prototype of the proposed system as a web-based user interface for personal knowledge management. This system presents a personal knowledge directory to a registered user. Such a directory has a personal ontology to integrate and classify the knowledge collected by a user from the Web. And the knowledge sharing activities among registered users generate partial reputation factors of knowledge items, their domain nodes, users and groups. Then new users can obtain the knowledge items proper to their needs, by referring such reputation values of those elements. In addition, users can also take the stem that is a set of common knowledge items over the domains designated by them. Thus proposed system can prevent cold-start problem because our knowledge recommendation mechanisms depend on the results of the collaborative knowledge sharing activities among users.},

abstract = {In Web search, users may remain unsatisfied for several reasons: the search engine may not be effective enough or the query might not reflect their intent. Years of research focused on providing the best user experience for the data available to the search engine. However, little has been done to address the cases in which relevant content for the specific user need has not been posted on the Web yet. One obvious solution is to directly ask other users to generate the missing content using Community Question Answering services such as Yahoo! Answers or Baidu Zhidao. However, formulating a full-fledged question after having issued a query requires some effort. Some previous work proposed to automatically generate natural language questions from a given query, but not for scenarios in which a searcher is presented with a list of questions to choose from. We propose here to generate synthetic questions that can actually be clicked by the searcher so as to be directly posted as questions on a Community Question Answering service. This imposes new constraints, as questions will be actually shown to searchers, who will not appreciate an awkward style or redundancy. To this end, we introduce a learning-based approach that improves not only the relevance of the suggested questions to the original query, but also their grammatical correctness. In addition, since queries are often underspecified and ambiguous, we put a special emphasis on increasing the diversity of suggestions via a novel diversification mechanism. We conducted several experiments to evaluate our approach by comparing it to prior work. The experiments show that our algorithm improves question quality by 14\% over prior work and that adding diversification reduced redundancy by 55\%.},

abstract = {With Web users' search tasks becoming increasingly complex, a single information source cannot necessarily satisfy their information needs. Searchers may rely on heterogeneous sources to complete their tasks, such as search engines, Community Question Answering (CQA), encyclopedia sites, and crowdsourcing platforms. Previous works focus on interaction behaviors with federated search results, including how to compose a federated Web search result page and what factors affect users' interaction behavior on aggregated search interfaces. However, little is known about which factors are crucial in determining users' search outcomes while facing multiple heterogeneous search services. In this paper, we design a lab-based user study to analyze what explicit and implicit factors affect search outcomes (information gain and user satisfaction) when users have access to heterogeneous information sources. In the study, each participant can access three different kinds of search services: a general search engine (Bing), a general CQA portal (Baidu Knows), and a high-quality CQA portal (Zhihu). Using questionnaires and interaction log data, we extract explicit and implicit signals to analyze how users' search outcomes are correlated with their behaviors on different information sources. Experimental results indicate that users' search experiences on CQA portals (such as users' perceived usefulness and number of result clicks) positively affect search outcome (information gain), while search satisfaction is significantly correlated with some other factors such as users' familiarity, interest and difficulty of the task. Besides, users' search satisfaction can be more accurately predicted by the implicit factors than search outcomes.},

A globally dispersed project offers several advantages; however, it creates additional challenges in regard to communication, coordination and information sharing and can lead to the failure of software projects. We propose a conceptual architecture for an ontology-based multi-agent system to provide active support to access software engineering domain knowledge and to recommend software development project captured in the Software Engineering Ontology. The Software Engineering Ontology is used as a communication framework to enable knowledge sharing and reuse while the multi-agent provides the autonomy and the reactive and proactive features to the multi-site software development environment. In this paper we focus on utilizing the proposed framework to support automated requirements traceability tasks. When there is a change in requirement, software agents work cooperatively to trace and identify potentially affected software artifacts and notify the relevant team members to make them aware of any changes.},

These studies, however, have not generally analyzed how external events are associated with a social network's structure and communicative properties. Here, we study how external events are associated with a network's change in structure and communications. Analyzing a complete dataset of millions of instant messages among the decision-makers in a large hedge fund and their network of outside contacts, we investigate the link between price shocks, network structure, and change in the affect and cognition of decision-makers embedded in the network. When price shocks occur the communication network tends not to display structural changes associated with adaptiveness. Rather, the network 'turtles up'. It displays a propensity for higher clustering, strong tie inter- action, and an intensification of insider vs. outsider communication. Further, we find changes in network structure pre- dict shifts in cognitive and affective processes, execution of new transactions, and local optimality of transactions better than prices, revealing the important predictive relationship between network structure and collective behavior within a social network.},

However, there are less investigations on the security implications of concurrently running GPU applications. In this paper, we explore security vulnerabilities of CUDA from multiple dimensions. In particular, we first present a study on GPU stack, and reveal that stack overflow of CUDA can affect the execution of other threads by manipulating different memory spaces. Then, we show that the heap of CUDA is organized in a way that allows threads from the same warp or different blocks or even kernels to overwrite each other’s content, which indicates a high risk of corrupting data or steering the execution flow by overwriting function pointers. Furthermore, we verify that integer overflow and function pointer overflow in struct also can be exploited on GPUs. But other attacks against format string and exception handler seems not feasible due to the design choices of CUDA runtime and programming language features. Finally, we propose potential solutions of preventing the presented vulnerabilities for CUDA.},

abstract = {Learning from the crowd has become increasingly popular in the Web and social media. There is a wide variety of crowdlearning sites in which, on the one hand, users learn from the knowledge that other users contribute to the site, and, on the other hand, knowledge is reviewed and curated by the same users using assessment measures such as upvotes or likes. In this paper, we present a probabilistic modeling framework of crowdlearning, which uncovers the evolution of a user's expertise over time by leveraging other users' assessments of her contributions. The model allows for both off-site and on-site learning and captures forgetting of knowledge. We then develop a scalable estimation method to fit the model parameters from millions of recorded learning and contributing events. We show the effectiveness of our model by tracing activity of ~25 thousand users in Stack Overflow over a 4.5 year period. We find that answers with high knowledge value are rare. Newbies and experts tend to acquire less knowledge than users in the middle range. Prolific learners tend to be also proficient contributors that post answers with high knowledge value.},

abstract = {A significant part of all research takes place in extra-academic organizations. Practitioner researchers often present their results in publications different from those in academia, e.g. in reports, sometimes (and here) referred to as "gray literature". Gray literature is increasingly available online. However, availability does not mean that reports are exploited to their full potential in research. Disciplines like archaeology have substantial problems with the scholarly communication and knowledge sharing between extra-academic and academic research. This paper approaches this problem from a report-user perspective. For the benefit of potential report users' gray literature literacies, report-writing practices are analyzed by means of practice theory. Qualitative interviews with six practitioner researchers in Swedish archaeology firms make up the material. The analysis focuses on how report writers draw on regulative, institutional, and infrastructural resources in their practices. Based on the findings about the practices in which reports are written and become informative, the paper presents seven suggestions supporting report users' potential to critically analyze and use report content. The results contribute to the information science field with insights into extra-academic information practices, and as input in a wider critical discussion of the information-related conditions for research outside academia.},

abstract = {Community-based Question Answering (CQA) has become popular in knowledge sharing sites since it allows users to get answers to complex, detailed, and personal questions directly from other users. Large archives of historical questions and associated answers have been accumulated. Retrieving relevant historical answers that best match a question is an essential component of a CQA service. Most state of the art approaches are based on bag-of-words models, which have been proven successful in a range of text matching tasks, but are insufficient for capturing the important word sequence information in short text matching. In this paper, a new architecture is proposed to more effectively model the complicated matching relations between questions and answers. It utilises a similarity matrix which contains both lexical and sequential information. Afterwards the information is put into a deep architecture to find potentially suitable answers. The experimental study shows its potential in improving matching accuracy of question and answer.},

Programmers increasingly rely on crowdsourced knowledge and code, as they look to Q&amp;A sites for answers or use code from publicly posted snippets. Programmers play, compete, and learn with the crowd, engaging in programming competitions and puzzles with crowds of programmers. Online IDEs make radically new forms of collaboration possible, allowing developers to synchronously program with crowds of distributed programmers. Programmer reputation is increasingly visible on Q&amp;A sites and public code repositories, opening new possibilities in how developers find jobs and companies identify talent. Crowds of non-programmers increasingly participate in development, usability testing software or even constructing specifications while playing games. Crowdfunding democratizes choices about which software is built, broadening the software which might be feasibly constructed. Approaches for crowd development seek to microtask software development, dramatically increasing participation in open source by enabling software projects to be built through casual, transient work.},

abstract = {This study assesses the self-reported outcomes of engagement in a three-week-long, international humanitarian engineering fieldwork course for undergraduate and graduate students. As part of the fieldwork, multi-disciplinary teams of students designed technology-based ventures in low-resource countries, including Kenya, Tanzania, India or Nicaragua. The venture development required students to engage business partners, work closely with the local communities, and conduct formal and informal presentations. Ventures included development of a solar-powered food dryer, biogas digester, affordable greenhouses, inexpensive biomedical devices, knowledge sharing platform for self-employed women, and a networked telemedicine system. Students reflected on their experiences at the conclusion of the fieldwork course. The researchers analyzed 106 students' self-reported outcomes using a mixed-methods approach. Broad categories of outcomes identified by students included teamwork, intercultural competency, professional and personal development. In this paper, we examine the themes emerging from the self-reported outcomes with the goal of better understanding how students process their experiences and the value of such experiences to students from the course and similar community-engaged scholarship experiences. The results presented in the paper can be leveraged to strengthen fieldwork experiences and develop effective strategies for branding the value of entrepreneurship education.},

Despite its popularity in knowledge sharing, its development still faces several challenges, among which a notable one is that a majority of questions get no response. How to improve the response ratio and reduce the number of unanswered social questions has become a challenging problem. Though some research in this context has been well studied, intrinsic factors that reveal profiles of social answerers are still less understood. In this paper, we try to discover: what kind of person is likely to be an answerer? To answer this question, we study multiple hypothetical factors from the perspectives of social and personal analysis. A set of experiments are conducted to identify the relationship between these factors and the action of answering. We present a comprehensive description alongside our analysis of behavioural patterns of answerers in the scenario of social information seeking.},

abstract = {In E-commerce sites, there are platforms for users to pose product-related questions and experienced customers may provide answers voluntarily. Among the questions asked by users, a large proportion of them are yes-no questions reflecting that users wish to know whether or not the product can satisfy a certain criterion or meet a certain expectation. Both Question Answering (QA) approaches and Community Question Answering methods are not suitable for answer prediction for new questions in this setting. The reasons are that questions are product-associated and many of them are concerned about user experiences and subjective opinions. In addition to existing question-answer pairs, user written reviews can provide useful clues for answer prediction. In this paper, we propose a new framework that can tackle the task of review-aware answer prediction for product-related questions. The aspect analytics model in this framework learns latent aspects as well as aspect-specific embeddings of reviews via a 3-order Autoencoder. One advantage of this learned model is that it can generate aspect-specific representations for new questions. The predictive answer model in our framework, learned jointly from existing questions, answers, and reviews, is able to predict the answers for new yes-no questions taking into consideration of aspects. Besides, our framework can provide supportive reviews grouped by relevant aspects serving as information for explainable answers. Experiment results on 15 different product categories from a large-scale benchmark E-commence QA dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework.},

There are two groups of academicians responded to the questionnaires: academicians who served in the year 2006; and academicians who served in 2008. Statistical analysis was conducted to the data gathered and collected from the questionnaires.

The enabling environment being presented with Information and Communication Technology (ICT) is taking on greater importance for bringing a lot of benefits to educational institutions such as universities. The benefits ICTs brings include increasing productivity, improving competence, providing better services and knowledge sharing, increasing competitiveness and reducing costs. As the demand for efficiency and competence increases, so does the ICT world. Every day new applications and software's are developed to meet the demand of users. Cloud Computing qualifies as one of the demanded technology at the moment because it gives users the impression of having infinite computing means, of which they can use as much as they need, without having to worry about how those resources are provided. A preliminary review through a qualitative research approach was employed where three higher institutions in Namibia were engaged. The focus was on gaining an initial overview of the needs and resource base capabilities of such typical institutions found in a typical developing country environment. The findings from this initial exercise will inform to a greater extent the positive indicators and probable hindrances to full implementation of cloud solutions.},

abstract = {Background: Software engineers spend a substantial amount of time using Web search to accomplish software engineering tasks. Such search tasks include finding code snippets, API documentation, seeking help with debugging, etc. While debugging a bug or crash, one of the common practices of software engineers is to search for information about the associated error or exception traces on the internet. Aims: In this paper, we analyze query logs from Bing to carry out a large scale study of software exceptions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first large scale study to analyze how Web search is used to find information about exceptions. Method: We analyzed about 1 million exception related search queries from a random sample of 5 billion web search queries. To extract exceptions from unstructured query text, we built a novel machine learning model. With the model, we extracted exceptions from raw queries and performed popularity, effort, success, query characteristic and web domain analysis. We also performed programming language-specific analysis to give a better view of the exception search behavior. Results: Using the model with an F1-score of 0.82, our study identifies most frequent, most effort-intensive, or less successful exceptions and popularity of community Q&amp;A sites. Conclusion: These techniques can help improve existing methods, documentation and tools for exception analysis and prediction. Further, similar techniques can be applied for APIs, frameworks, etc.},

abstract = {Sharing of knowledge takes place mainly in social networks. Anthropological methods can help to identify networks where exchange on certain topics takes place. Once transparency about existing networks has been established, they can be fostered cautiously. Conditions for successful knowledge sharing are examined. Where people are in close contact and relationships are multiplex, knowledge sharing works best. Likewise, an anthropological theory of exchange confirms a focus on networks. An example of successful knowledge sharing in practice demonstrates important factors: Direct, oral exchange of knowledge is intrinsically motivating. People sharing knowledge orally can make their name among their peers and get immediate feedback from them. Therefore, a personalized approach is recommended where the supplier of knowledge provides advice following individual requests. KM systems should mainly establish transparency about relevant carriers of knowledge.},

From predicting election results, to customer satisfaction, to scientific surveys, polls play a crucial rule in revealing the true sentiment of a community. However, when participation in a poll is subject to having some specific expertise and skills, finding sufficient number of participants for a given poll is a serious challenge. In this paper, we propose a new method of polling crowd contextual insight which is based on decomposing a poll into some sub-polls and recruiting participants to answer the given questions. We also take into account the probability of engagement of a participant in a poll to make sure that we recruit sufficient number of suitable workers. The proposed method is implemented and tested using the simulated data, build based on a public data dump from Stack overflow. The evaluation results show the superiority of our proposed method over the other related work.},

This explosion of knowledge sharing on the web is also leading to the formation of knowledge silos and a growing need for integration of these sources. Automated solutions to mapping ontologies are emerging that address this growing need with very promising results. However, most approaches have focused on mapping ontologies using relationships of similarity and equivalence and very few have applied knowledge in upper ontologies. We built algorithms to acquire relationships between ontological components beyond similarity and equivalence that include hyponymy and more importantly, algorithms to map ontologies based on relationships that are specified within the ontologies. These algorithms employ the semantics of OWL in conjunction with online linguistic resources and upper ontologies. Initial test results are promising.},

abstract = {The momentum of the modern world increasingly requires a rapid and situational learning of new skills. Due to the growing information intensity, the trend towards shorter innovation cycles and the reduction of knowledge half-live time degrades the importance of factual knowledge. In order to enhance performance and productivity, computers are increasingly taking over the role of a learning partner supporting our individual handling of diverse information sources and exploring synergies between large communities. In such an evolutionary cyber-social environment, new potentials for co-creative systems are emerging, assisting users in understanding, learning, decision-making, and memorizing. This paper is a summary of my keynote I gave at KMO 2016. It discusses the various factors and presents examples of current research and development that will affect our way of learning in the near future. It is trying to give some answers to the following questions: What is expertise and what is the prerequisite for it? What factors influence the creation of competence today? How can technology be employed to act as associative memories for supporting knowledge work in cyber-social settings? How to support knowledge sharing? Can you measure and anticipate information needs? How to employ interactive learning aids for co-creation?},

publisher = {AAAI Press},
abstract = {We study tag recommendation for questions in community question answering (CQA). Tags represent the semantic summarization of questions are useful for navigation and expert finding in CQA and can facilitate content consumption such as searching and mining in these web sites. The task is challenging, as both questions and tags are short and a large fraction of tags are tail tags which occur very infrequently. To solve these problems, we propose matching questions and tags not only by themselves, but also by similar questions and similar tags. The idea is then formalized as a model in which we calculate question-tag similarity using a linear combination of similarity with similar questions and tags weighted by tag importance. Question similarity, tag similarity, and tag importance are learned in a supervised random walk framework by fusing multiple features. Our model thus can not only accurately identify question-tag similarity for head tags, but also improve the accuracy of recommendation of tail tags. Experimental results show that the proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on tag recommendation for questions. Particularly, it improves tail tag recommendation accuracy by a large margin.},

abstract = {For tasks like code synthesis from natural language, code retrieval, and code summarization, data-driven models have shown great promise. However, creating these models require parallel data between natural language (NL) and code with fine-grained alignments. Stack Overflow (SO) is a promising source to create such a data set: the questions are diverse and most of them have corresponding answers with high quality code snippets. However, existing heuristic methods (e.g., pairing the title of a post with the code in the accepted answer) are limited both in their coverage and the correctness of the NL-code pairs obtained. In this paper, we propose a novel method to mine high-quality aligned data from SO using two sets of features: hand-crafted features considering the structure of the extracted snippets, and correspondence features obtained by training a probabilistic model to capture the correlation between NL and code using neural networks. These features are fed into a classifier that determines the quality of mined NL-code pairs. Experiments using Python and Java as test beds show that the proposed method greatly expands coverage and accuracy over existing mining methods, even when using only a small number of labeled examples. Further, we find that reasonable results are achieved even when training the classifier on one language and testing on another, showing promise for scaling NL-code mining to a wide variety of programming languages beyond those for which we are able to annotate data.},

abstract = {Increasing social and economic imbalances as well as restricted access to production means and participation in value creation processes ask for new approaches to overcome the asymmetric distribution of knowledge and information between producers and consumers as well as between industrialized and developing countries. Technical progress in production technology, the advancement and spread of information and communication technologies (ICT) as well as the spill-over of the highly efficient and innovative open source principles to the world of physical products represent a new set of tools and concepts to address this challenge. Correspondingly, we can observe (new) modes of value creation that put into question traditional economic strategies and assumptions by stressing collaboration instead of competition and knowledge sharing instead of black box engineering. The FabLab movement (fabrication laboratory) is one emerging and promising approach for decentralized, participative, locally grounded and globally interconnected value creation. This paper presents findings from a study on the latest development, effects and success of FabLabs focusing especially on its potential for development cooperation. Based on findings from the survey and the premises of the FabLab idea, we finally present the multidisciplinary OpenLabs concept.},

In these studies we identified four CoP considered important; users, core business managers, IT coordinators and system developers. The analysis shows in what ways the communities contribute to the difficulties for a successful establishment of UCP. One example is marginalising the IT coordinator community, and another is imperialism of the system developer community as well as the lack of boundary spanning skills. The results indicate that we need to influence all levels in organisations, with a focus on boundaries between communities, in order to successfully introduce a UCP. Boundary spanning objects need to be identified and knowledge sharing needs to be enhanced.},

abstract = {To uncover interesting and actionable information from natural language documents authored by software developers, many researchers rely on "out-of-the-box" NLP libraries. However, software artifacts written in natural language are different from other textual documents due to the technical language used. In this paper, we first analyze the state of the art through a systematic literature review in which we find that only a small minority of papers justify their choice of an NLP library. We then report on a series of experiments in which we applied four state-of-the-art NLP libraries to publicly available software artifacts from three different sources. Our results show low agreement between different libraries (only between 60\% and 71\% of tokens were assigned the same part-of-speech tag by all four libraries) as well as differences in accuracy depending on source: For example, spaCy achieved the best accuracy on Stack Overflow data with nearly 90\% of tokens tagged correctly, while it was clearly outperformed by Google's SyntaxNet when parsing GitHub ReadMe files. Our work implies that researchers should make an informed decision about the particular NLP library they choose and that customizations to libraries might be necessary to achieve good results when analyzing software artifacts written in natural language.},

Then, a fuzzy ontology framework is presented, including three parts: concepts, properties of concepts and values of properties. The application, which uses fuzzy ontology to model customer and product knowledge in supply chain, shows that these models can overcome the localization of other fuzzy ontology models, and this research facilitates the fuzzy knowledge sharing and reuse on the Semantic Web.},

We explain how organizations and teams can proactively manage distributed work arrangements to best position the team to take advantage of knowledge sharing for enhanced performance.},

These web-portals whereas identified successful in communicating with the stakeholders also played a vital role in sharing and managing knowledge. Based on this notion, this article is concerned with the role of e-government portal in sharing knowledge and the way through which this portal increases the efficiency of entire public sector. In the same instance, the K-ACT model of internet portal is analyzed to identify the features that make a web-portal best and perfect. In this article, we conducted a literature review and focused our attention on analyzing the e-government portals of four countries i.e. China, Hong Kong, Beijing and Turkish Municipalities. For the analysis and comparison purposes, the checklist of K-ACT model is used. The findings revealed that the e-government portal of these countries is not fully matched with the features as described in K-ACT, which ultimately affect the knowledge management and sharing practices in the region. Therefore, recommendations are made to improve the existing portal for knowledge sharing so that citizens can take more knowledge benefits from the e-government portals.},

One important problem is how to find out experts who are qualified and willing to answer the question. Also, with the rapidly increasing number of new questions, experts of experienced in specified domains are not easy to find their interested questions. In this paper, we assume that the ones who have relationships with the questioner are more willing to answer the questions proposed by the questioner than other people. Based on this assumption, we explore the problem of Social Question and Answering and proposed a method to find out the experts who are qualified and willing to answer the questions based on the social relationships of the questioner.},

abstract = {The cyber world has seen growth in the online business over the past two decades and e-commerce continues to expand. Moreover it has brought ease and comfort in the lives of the people and now there is no distinction of states and regions. Mainstream people can buy anything from anywhere in the world through web-platforms such as Amazon.com, thus enhancing e-commerce. However, the major concern that arises is the security apprehension. This research paper studies the willingness of the online shopper to disclose personal information. The study will use a conceptual model to examine customers' online activities and how variables such as user trust, knowledge sharing behavior, and loyalty intentions influence users' privacy concerns, and further moderated by one's perceived environmental security in the B2C Internet market. Social Contract Theory (SCT) will be used to analyze the issue in the behavioral perspective, based on the human obligations towards one another and on the state as the supreme authority that establishes the principles that maintain the balance of a society.},

It seems clear that research collaborations across disciplinary, geographical, and institutional boundaries have played a critical role in the growth of knowledge on e-government and that it can become a powerful driving force for future advances in this field. Using a multi-method approach and longitudinal data, combining archival research, conventional statistics, and social network analysis, this paper explores how individuals who had joined the North American Digital Government Working Group from different disciplines, countries, and organizations form a research-oriented collaboration group and how the group evolves into an integrated and productive e-Gov knowledge network. The results show that interpersonal face-to-face communication relationships that had been sustained for a long time played a critical role in building and maintaining network ties for collaborative knowledge creation and resource sharing and that sharing research resources and creating knowledge through collaborative efforts at dyadic levels were closely intertwined in this transnational interdisciplinary knowledge-sharing network.},

abstract = {In this paper, we interpret the community question answering websites on the StackExchange platform as knowledge markets, and analyze how and why these markets can fail at scale. A knowledge market framing allows site operators to reason about market failures, and to design policies to prevent them. Our goal is to provide insights on large-scale knowledge market failures through an interpretable model. We explore a set of interpretable economic production models on a large empirical dataset to analyze the dynamics of content generation in knowledge markets. Amongst these, the Cobb-Douglas model best explains empirical data and provides an intuitive explanation for content generation through the concepts of elasticity and diminishing returns. Content generation depends on user participation and also on how specific types of content (e.g. answers) depends on other types (e.g. questions). We show that these factors of content generation have constant elasticity and a percentage increase in any of the inputs leads to a constant percentage increase in the output. Furthermore, markets exhibit diminishing returns-the marginal output decreases as the input is incrementally increased. Knowledge markets also vary on their returns to scale-the increase in output resulting from a proportionate increase in all inputs. Importantly, many knowledge markets exhibit diseconomies of scale-measures of market health (e.g., the percentage of questions with an accepted answer) decrease as a function of the number of participants. The implications of our work are two-fold: site operators ought to design incentives as a function of system size (number of participants); the market lens should shed insight into complex dependencies amongst different content types and participant actions in general social networks.},

Moreover, attackers tend to use obfuscation techniques, such as encryption, to evade intrusion detection systems. In this paper, we show that a common stack-overflow attack, namely the return-to-libc attack, coupled with a common defense, namely the Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR), together allow for constructing a key-agreement protocol that allows two entities (e.g., a Trojan and a controller) to agree on a shared key, whereas the shared key can then be used to encrypt further communication. We have developed a prototype of our key-agreement protocol to evaluate its feasibility and performance. Our results show that both time and message overhead of our protocol are linear in key length. Although our key-agreement protocol can be used by attackers for malicious purposes, it has low computation overhead, making it a candidate for adoption in CPU-constrained platforms.},

How can we spot an insightful question that would inspire massive further discussions in CQA sites? How can we detect a valuable answer that benefits many users? The long-term impact (e.g., the size of the population a post benefits) of a question/answer post is the key quantity to answer these questions. In this paper, we aim to predict the long-term impact of questions/answers shortly after they are posted in the CQA sites. In particular, we propose a family of algorithms for the prediction problem by modeling three key aspects, i.e., non-linearity, question/answer coupling, and dynamics. We analyze our algorithms in terms of optimality, correctness, and complexity. We conduct extensive experimental evaluations on two real CQA data sets to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our algorithms.},

abstract = {Vertical selection is the task of predicting relevant verticals for a Web query so as to enrich the Web search results with complementary vertical results. We investigate a novel variant of this task, where the goal is to detect queries with a question intent. Specifically, we address queries for which the user would like an answer with a human touch. We call these CQA-intent queries, since answers to them are typically found in community question answering (CQA) sites. A typical approach in vertical selection is using a vertical's specific language model of relevant queries and computing the query-likelihood for each vertical as a selective criterion. This works quite well for many domains like Shopping, Local and Travel. Yet, we claim that queries with CQA intent are harder to distinguish by modeling content alone, since they cover many different topics. We propose to also take the structure of queries into consideration, reasoning that queries with question intent have quite a different structure than other queries. We present a supervised classification scheme, random forest over word-clusters for variable length texts, which can model the query structure. Our experiments show that it substantially improves classification performance in the CQA-intent selection task compared to content-oriented based classification, especially as query length grows.},

However, parallel EA and ITIL projects can lead to wasted resources and a duplication of costs and efforts.

Our goal is twofold: on one hand to give the architect the elements, relationships and models that represent best practices in IT service management, and, on the other, to formally model ITIL for knowledge sharing, stakeholder communication and to contribute to ITIL discussion and validation. For evaluation we shall use interviews and the Wand and Weber ontological method.},

To fluidly share our knowledge in co-located environments, each person's digital experience should be merged and presented on a collaborative display device such as a face-to-face tabletop display. For capturing concrete requirements for such face-to-face fluid knowledge sharing, we built a prototype system that presents merged multi-users' Web browsing histories on a tabletop display. We experimented with our prototype in an exhibition and collected over 100 filled questionnaires and informal observations.},

abstract = {The promise of collective intelligence emerging from voluntary participation, contribution and knowledge sharing brought about by ubiquitous information and communication technologies has recently attracted the attention of academics and practitioners alike. Of many related phenomena, open source software (OSS) development has been touted as one of the leading examples that speak to the potential of collective intelligence. Recently, the advent of novel open collaboration platforms for open source software development, such as Github, has prompted researchers to examine the impact of increased work transparency induced by the introduction of social features on voluntary self-organization and allocation of resources to projects. We present both qualitative and quantitative analyses from which we derive some initial propositions regarding the impact of transparency on voluntary self-organization processes and decision mechanisms.},

abstract = {Many collaborative applications, especially in scientific research, focus only on the sharing of tools or the sharing of data. We seek to introduce an approach to scientific collaboration that is based on the sharing of knowledge. We do this by automatically building organizational memory and enabling knowledge sharing by observing what users do with a particular tool or set of tools in the domain, through the addition of activity and usage monitoring facilities to standalone applications. Once this knowledge has been gathered, we apply social networking models to provide collaborative features to users, such as suggestions on tools to use, and automatically-generated sequences of actions based on past usage amongst the members of a social network or the entire community. In this work, we investigate social networking models as an approach to scientific knowledge sharing, and present an implementation called genSpace, which is built as an extension to the geWorkbench platform for computational biologists. Last, we discuss the approach from the viewpoint of social software engineering.},

abstract = {The free technologies adoption by governments is not a new phenomenon. As an innovative contribution, this paper proposes a collective intelligence (CI) approach for improving the free software adoption by small and medium-sized municipalities. To build this CI-approach, the authors have analyzed the dynamic of the communities hosted by Brazilian Public Software (BPS) Portal and the actions related to implementation of software solution in Brazilian municipalities. They started by identifying key variables and their relationship, and mining data from the communities whose software solutions have been successfully implemented in the municipalities according to player reports available in BPS portal. Such as the relationships demonstrate, these players have been appropriated the knowledge related to solutions and created new business to support the modernization of public administration. Based on reports and statistical analysis, the authors could understand both the dynamic of the successful communities and the adoption phenomena by municipalities as a consequence of individual initiatives. The results indicate that a CI-approach based on 5W1H can improve the knowledge sharing and promote the best practice in the free software adoption by small and medium-sized municipalities.},

abstract = {In the last two decades, research on knowledge management (KM) has shifted its focus to understanding the role of knowledge management tools in achieving business objectives. However, KM initiatives often remain dispersed, especially in highly distributed organizational settings, such as business networks. Existing research on cross-organizational knowledge management focuses primarily on efficiencies through shared services while neglecting a knowledge sharing and creation perspective. Here we take a knowledge maturing perspective to propose a model for requirements knowledge which - instead of looking at single activities of retrieval -- considers a continuous cycle where the knowledge intensive processes and requirements shape each other. We develop the model using the insight from a case study of a European business network. Our findings for meeting innovation requirements reflect that the selective access to communication platforms due to the less formal network structure needs to be substituted by process based roles and tasks of employees. Considering efficiency requirements diverse data sources result in the need to capture and incorporate the semantics of concepts for elimination of duplicated process related effort. Regarding quality requirements the guidance role of matured knowledge, such as standards, best practices, controls etc. needs to be integrated.},

In this scenario, an interesting study about the first global power, China, is presented. The paper analyzes how Chinese enterprises manage their knowledge using variables linked to knowledge sharing and knowledge creation. Data were extracted by World Bank between December 2011 and February 2013, and the analysis has two parts. First the percentage of innovative enterprises within China is identified and then, a descriptive analysis about the situation of Chinese innovative firms is realized. In addition ANOVA technique is used. Results show that almost the half of Chinese enterprises (around 47 per cent) is considered as innovative, and these innovative firms make decisions focused on active measures related to knowledge management. Then they realize an active used of new technologies in order to communicate with people related to the organization (sharing knowledge) and also to develop new ideas within the organization (creation knowledge). Chinese Government could use our paper in order to know how their enterprises manage their knowledge and, accordingly, they could motivate non-innovative enterprises to incorporate actively knowledge management process.},

abstract = {Software reuse provides benefits during the software development and maintenance processes. The use of APIs is one of the most common ways to reuse. However, obtaining an easy-to-understand documentation is a challenge faced by developers. Several papers have proposed alternatives to make API documentation more understandable, or even more detailed. However, these studies have not taken into account the complexity of examples in order to make documentation adaptable to different levels of developer experience. In this work, we developed and evaluated four different methodologies to generate tutorials for APIs from the contents of Stack Overflow and organize them according to the complexity of understanding. The methodologies were evaluated through tutorials generated for the Swing API. A survey was conducted to evaluate eight different features of the generated tutorials. The overall outcome was positive on several characteristics, showing the feasibility of automatically generated tutorials. In addition, the adoption of features for presenting tutorial elements in order of complexity, for separating the tutorial in basic and advanced parts, for selecting posts with a tutorial nature and with didactic source code had significantly better results regarding the generation methodology.},

We explore this learning process in four different SQAs that utilize the Stack Exchange platform: Science Fiction \&amp; Fantasy, Seasoned Advice (cooking), Database Administrators, and Android Enthusiasts. Using longitudinal fixed effects models, we examine whether users learn to be better question askers over time, and how user interface features and community norms affect the cultivation of this critical skill. The study offers design implications by highlighting factors that help users develop into literate and productive community contributors in social platforms.},

abstract = {When designing a Q&amp;A social network, it is essential to know what profile elements are necessary to build a complete profile for a user. Using data from Stack Overflow, we examined the profile data of users in order to determine the relationship between a complete profile (one that has values for each profile element: website URL, location, about me, profile image and age) and their contribution to the network in terms of reputation scores and quality of question and answer posts. Our analysis shows that most users do not have a complete profile, however the average reputation earned by users with complete profiles is significantly higher than that earned by users with incomplete profiles. In addition, users with complete profiles post higher quality question and answers, hence are more useful to the network. We also determined that, of the five profile elements studied, location and about me have a higher correlation than the others. This research is a step in determining what profile elements are important in a typical Q&amp;A social network and which of these elements should regularly be used together.},

Therefore, one challenge in human-machine integration is how to establish an appropriate knowledge management (KM) model to support integration and sharing of heterogeneous product knowledge. Aiming at the diversity of design knowledge, this paper proposes an ontology-based model to reach at an unambiguous and normative representation of the knowledge. Firstly, an ontology-based human-machine integrated design framework is described, then corresponding ontologies and sub-ontologies are established according to different purposes and scopes. Secondly, a similarity calculation-based ontology integration method composed of ontology mapping and ontology merging is introduced. The ontology searching-based knowledge sharing method is then developed. Finally, a case of human-machine integrated design of a large ultra-precision grinding machine is used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the method.},

abstract = {Project management methodologies aim at reaching effectiveness during a project by supporting managers in planning and controlling tasks. But inappropriate use of risk assessment and decision making processes can still affect task completion during a project. New management methodologies must therefore be developed that enhance knowledge sharing by considering the viewpoints of more experts, supporting ad-hoc communications between partners and improving secured integration of technologies. Not only could time management become more efficient because the managers would have a broader, deeper understanding of the decisional context, but it could also minimise investment risks by enabling fast reactivity to any unforeseen issues.Based on the above requirements, the Pro-Active Project Management is introduced here as a solution to current project management limitations. It makes full use of advanced technologies, such as virtual reality, to enable knowledge sharing at any time between any members of a project. After an analysis of current issues, this paper thus introduces the Pro-Active Project Management methodologies and the technologies that enable its implementation. It finally shows how such a methodology helps achieving efficiency in a project.},

To help focus on the main actors and assets composing the 3D printing innovation roles in healthcare we model: the DiDIY-er as the main initiator of the practice innovation; the available technology allowing the envisioning of new practices; the specific activities gaining benefits from the innovative techniques introduced; and the knowledge community continuously supporting and evolving knowledge practices. A general introduction on the notion of Knowledge Artifacts (KAs) and on the use of 3D printing (3DP) in medicine will be followed by our research questions and by a more detailed analysis of diagnostic, training and surgical planning activities for clinicians and patients. Observations carried out in a hospital in Italy are reported to exemplify activities based on 3DP bone models in the radiological and orthopaedic fields. These observations can be considered a second contribution of the paper, although secondary with respect to the conceptual framework. They also help proof how knowledge sharing and circulation in the community of healthcare professionals may be improved by the introduction of tangible and intangible KAs around the practice of DiDIY. Our framework is then presented in the end.},

abstract = {Opinions are key determinants to many of the activities related to software development. The perceptions of developers about an API, and the choices they make about whether and how they should use it, may, to a considerable degree, be conditioned upon how other developers see and evaluate the API. Given the plethora of APIs available for a given development task and the advent of developer forums as the media to share opinions about those APIs, it can be challenging for a developer to make informed decisions about an API to support the task. We introduce Opiner, our opinion search and summarization engine for API reviews. The server side of Opiner collects and summarizes opinions about APIs by crawling online developer forums and by associating the opinions found in the forum posts to the APIs discussed in the posts. The client side of Opiner is a Website that presents different summarized viewpoints of the opinions about the APIs in an online search engine. We evaluated Opiner by asking Industrial developers to select APIs for two development tasks. We found that developers were interested to use our proposed summaries of API reviews and that while combined with Stack Overflow, Opiner helped developers to make the right decision with more accuracy and confidence. The Opiner online search engine is available at: http://opiner.polymtl.ca. A video demo is available at: https://youtu.be/XAXpfmg5Lqs.},

Most of these studies reuse existing sentiment analysis tools such as SentiStrength and NLTK. However, these tools have been trained on product reviews and movie reviews and, therefore, their results might not be applicable in the software engineering domain. In this paper we study whether the sentiment analysis tools agree with the sentiment recognized by human evaluators (as reported in an earlier study) as well as with each other. Furthermore, we evaluate the impact of the choice of a sentiment analysis tool on software engineering studies by conducting a simple study of differences in issue resolution times for positive, negative and neutral texts. We repeat the study for seven datasets (issue trackers and Stack Overflow questions) and different sentiment analysis tools and observe that the disagreement between the tools can lead to contradictory conclusions.},

abstract = {Collaborative web sites, such as collaborative encyclopedias, blogs, and forums, are characterized by a loose edit control, which allows anyone to freely edit their content. As a consequence, the quality of this content raises much concern. To deal with this, many sites adopt manual quality control mechanisms. However, given their size and change rate, manual assessment strategies do not scale and content that is new or unpopular is seldom reviewed. This has a negative impact on the many services provided, such as ranking and recommendation. To tackle with this problem, we propose a learning to rank (L2R) approach for ranking answers in Q&amp;A forums. In particular, we adopt an approach based on Random Forests and represent query and answer pairs using eight different groups of features. Some of these features are used in the Q&amp;A domain for the first time. Our L2R method was trained to learn the answer rating, based on the feedback users give to answers in Q&amp;A forums. Using the proposed method, we were able (i) to outperform a state of the art baseline with gains of up to 21\% in NDCG, a metric used to evaluate rankings; we also conducted a comprehensive study of the features, showing that (ii) review and user features are the most important in the Q&amp;A domain although text features are useful for assessing quality of new answers; and (iii) the best set of new features we proposed was able to yield the best quality rankings.},

Answers, Baidu Zhidao, Quora, StackOverflowetc., where forum users respond to questions with precise answers. Over time, such cQA archives become rich repositories of knowledge encoded in the form of questions and user generated answers. In cQA archives, retrieval of similar questions, which have already been answered in some form, is important for improving the effectiveness of such forums. The main challenge while retrieving similar questions is the "lexico-syntactic" gap between the user query and the questions already present in the forum. In this paper, we propose a novel approach called "Deep Structured Topic Model DSTM" to bridge the lexico-syntactic gap between the question posed by the user and forum questions. DSTM employs a two-step process consisting of initially retrieving similar questions that lie in the vicinity of the query and latent topic vector space and then re-ranking them using a deep layered semantic model. Experiments on large scale real-life cQA dataset show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art translation and topic based baseline approaches.},

abstract = {Naver has been the most popular search engine for over a decade in South Korea. As a search portal, Naver aims to match a user's search intentions to the information from the web pages and databases, and to connect users based on shared interests to provide the best way to find the information. Over the past decade, Naver has been trying to better understand Korean users, queries, and web pages for PC and mobile search. In 2002, Naver introduced Knowledge-IN, which was the forerunner of community Question Answering to find out the need of users and topic experts. Users can ask their specific inquiry to appropriate topic experts in their search results. In addition to PC and mobile, Naver is trying to enable a user to access the relevant information using any other device or interface. In detecting common interest groups and good creators, Naver adds device and interface factors. Not only the contents, but also the delivery media types are important in satisfying users on various devices. Deep learning (DL) based methods have tremendous progress in image and text classification. With DL based methods, not only queries, and text documents, but also images, videos, live-streams, locations, etc. are classified and linked to detect common interest groups, and select and rank good creators and good delivery types in each group. With DL, Naver seeks to provide search results that meet user needs more precisely while learning and improving on the fly. In this talk, I'll cover some efforts and challenges in understanding and satisfying users on various devices.},

abstract = {Many tools that automatically analyze, summarize, or transform software artifacts rely on natural language processing tooling for the interpretation of natural language text produced by software developers, such as documentation, code comments, commit messages, or bug reports. Processing natural language text produced by software developers is challenging because of unique characteristics not found in other texts, such as the presence of code terms and the systematic use of incomplete sentences. In addition, texts produced by Portuguese-speaking developers mix languages since many keywords and programming concepts are referred to by their English name. In this paper, we provide empirical insights into the challenges of analyzing software artifacts written in Portuguese. We analyzed 100 question titles from the Portuguese version of Stack Overflow with two Portuguese language tools and identified multiple problems which resulted in very few sentences being tagged completely correctly. Based on these results, we propose heuristics to improve the analysis of natural language text produced by software developers in Portuguese.},

These properties are taken into consideration in this paper, and the emergency material characteristics and management requirements are analyzed sufficiently. Combing with the distributed collaborative model of artificial intelligence, the agent communication model of blackboard structure is designed. An active blackboard design pattern is taken, and the emergency materials management information system is constructed.

abstract = {Software APIs often contain too many methods and parameters for developers to memorize or navigate effectively. Instead, developers resort to finding answers through online search engines and systems such as Stack Overflow. However, the process of finding and integrating a working solution is often very time-consuming. Though code search engines have increased in quality, there remain significant language- and workflow-gaps in meeting end-user needs. Novice and intermediate programmers often lack the language to query, and the expertise in transferring found code to their task. To address this problem, we present CodeMend, a system to support finding and integration of code. CodeMend leverages a neural embedding model to jointly model natural language and code as mined from large Web and code datasets. We also demonstrate a novel, mixed-initiative, interface to support query and integration steps. Through CodeMend, end-users describe their goal in natural language. The system makes salient the relevant API functions, the lines in the end-user's program that should be changed, as well as proposing the actual change. We demonstrate the utility and accuracy of CodeMend through lab and simulation studies.},

We designed a user interface: CIRR tool (Collaborative Information Retrieval Research) that supports sharing of search results as well as search queries (knowledge of finding the relevant items). We conducted a pilot study to explore what factors would affect the use of these knowledge sharing features. The results demonstrate that knowledge sharing in general is preferred by only some subjects for some tasks. For those who preferred sharing they share search queries, domain knowledge, and search results, rather than the usefulness judgment. The findings also show that knowledge sharing does not seem to have effects on search performance. However, it is significantly associated with the perceived task difficulty. The possible reasons leading to these results are analyzed. Limitations of this study are pointed out and the future studies are discussed.},

Next, we discuss our experiences on how architectural knowledge is shared in a large software development organization. Based on these experiences we propose a set of prerequisites that need to be met to foster successful architectural knowledge sharing. The importance of these prerequisites is motivated by demonstrating that they create the identified incentives.},

Our results suggest that self-control is central to learning, but may be hampered by low levels of trust and expertise at the outset of projects. For these foundations to develop, clients initially need to exert high amounts of formal and clan controls to enforce learning activities against barriers to knowledge sharing. Once learning activities occur, trust and expertise increase and control portfolios may show greater emphases on self-control.},

abstract = {One of the most significant techniques for determining the prevalence of cardiovascular diseases involves the use of the Electrocardiogram (ECG). However, education on ECG has often been provided in a manner that can be described to be old-fashioned. The old-fashioned style involves the use of didactic teaching techniques as well as the incorpofiguration of ECG model strips available in the literature or textbooks. Nevertheless, the current explosion in the utilization of the Internet has made multimedia educational websites as well as knowledge sharing platforms popular. This paper proposes a novel cloud-based simulation tool that can help healthcare students to learn and interpret ECG signals as well as cases. This simulation tool works by constructing an interactive 2D simulator of ECG signals. Even though it is regarded to be a mere simulation tool, it has the capacity to provide teachers and students in the healthcare industry with the experiences derived from the real ECG signals. From this study, it is evident that the simulation tool enhances the educational process of ECG signals. The results and discussions in this study aim at complementing the traditional tools used in the learning process and deploying the new simulation tool in various educational organizations such as e-learning sites, medical colleges, and healthcare institutes.},

abstract = {This paper proposes mining query subtopics from questions in community question answering (CQA). The subtopics are represented as a number of clusters of questions with keywords summarizing the clusters. The task is unique in that the subtopics from questions can not only facilitate user browsing in CQA search, but also describe aspects of queries from a question-answering perspective. The challenges of the task include how to group semantically similar questions and how to find keywords capable of summarizing the clusters. We formulate the subtopic mining task as a non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) problem and further extend the model of NMF to incorporate question similarity estimated from metadata of CQA into learning. Compared with existing methods, our method can jointly optimize question clustering and keyword extraction and encourage the former task to enhance the latter. Experimental results on large scale real world CQA datasets show that the proposed method significantly outperforms the existing methods in terms of keyword extraction, while achieving a comparable performance to the state-of-the-art methods for question clustering.},

In this study, we analyze the distribution gamification-influenced tendencies on the Q&amp;A Stack Overflow online community. In addition, we define some gamification-influenced metrics related to response time to a question post. We carried experiments of a four-month period analyzing 101,291 members posts. Over this period, we determined a Rapid Response time of 327 seconds (5.45 minutes). Key findings suggest that around 92\% of SO members have fewer rapid responses that non-rapid responses. Accepted answers have no clear relationship with rapid responses. However, we did find that rapid responses significantly contain tags that did not follow their usual tagging tendencies.},

abstract = {Community question answering (CQA) is widely used in Web information seeking. Web service selection (WSS) is often required to provide concurrent CQA services. WSS involves energy consumption of servers. However, existing techniques rarely consider energy consumption when dealing with concurrent WSS. To bridge this gap, we propose the mixed-integer optimization based green service selection (MIOGSS) for large-scale concurrent CQA service, which minimizes energy consumption and satisfies the common QoS of task response time. We focus on applying MIOGSS to service discovery and evaluation when dealing with concurrent request tasks. First, we propose a method to discover service candidates according to request tasks. Task de-duplication is used to reduce redundant tasks. Second, we apply a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) to evaluate service candidates by trading off their energy consumption, execution and transmission time. Third, we develop a cost model to optimize MILP, which decreases the search space of service evaluation. Consequently, a MIOGSS enabled large-scale concurrent CQA system is developed for selecting appropriate services with minimum MILP value to answer concurrent user requests. Experiments show that MIOGSS performs well in energy saving and guarantees the quality of the large-scale concurrent CQA service.},

With the appearance of project outsourcing, the location of project workplace becomes increasingly multiple, which challenges the administration of senior management to projects. In this paper, we analyze the daily knowledge sharing activities, including the organizational structure, the procedure of project planning and the scenarios of project distribution, by a case study in City of Melville Council -- a typical multi-site project organization, to discover the issues in these activities. By means of extending the theory of CCCI Metrics into the field of project management, we design the multi-site project track and trace ontology, in order to promote the knowledge sharing activities between senior management and project groups.},

We use through-put and cwnd as evaluation metrics. The simulation results show that for small data rates, routing has a big effect on the performance of the network and AODV has better link stability and performance compared with OLSR. For big data rates, both protocols have almost the same performance. Because of congestion, node stack overflow and the routing have a small effect.},

KM in software development has been the center of attention for researchers due to its potential to improve productivity. However, the knowledge is not only stored in repositories but is also shared in the office space. Agile software development teams use the benefits of shared space to foster knowledge creation. But it is difficult to create and share this type of knowledge, when team members are distributed. This participatory single-case study indicates that, distributed team members rely heavily on knowledge codification and application of tools for knowledge sharing. We have found that, the studied project did not use any specific software or hardware that would enable spatial knowledge creation and sharing. Therefore parts of the knowledge items not codified were destined to be unavailable for remote team members.},

abstract = {In an information seeking episode, attributes such as relevance, quality, and the nature of the information sought/obtained are directly related to the nature and the quality of the query or question that represents an information need. It is, therefore, imperative that we identify potential problems with such representation to make the information seeking outcome and the experience more successful. In this paper, we investigate the question quality for the educational community question answering (CQA) site Brainly by examining 2,000 questions, of which 1,000 were answered and 1,000 were unanswered. Two human assessors rated the quality of each question on a scale from 1-5 based on factors such as ambiguity, poor syntax, lack of information, complexity, inappropriateness, and inconsistency. We then identified different textual features that are needed to detect question quality. A logistic regression classifier was built to categorize question features based on the rating scale and textual features present in the question. The results show higher ROC curves for ambiguity, lack of information, inappropriateness, complexity and excessive information; and lower ROC values for poor syntax and inconsistency among the questions. The findings demonstrate that the classifier failed to perform when faced with ill-framed or inconsistent phrases in a question. The work described here presents a method for identifying high and low-quality questions, the knowledge of which could be instrumental in helping reformulate users' questions and present them to a system or a community for more successful processes and outcomes.},

The main purpose of the present study is to explore the various individual difference antecedents of perceived enjoyment and examine how they influence behavioral intention to blog through the mediation of perceived enjoyment. Based on the previous literature, the Big Five personality traits (i.e., extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, neuroticism, and openness to experience), as well as computer self-efficacy and personal innovation in information technology (PIIT), are hypothesized as potential antecedents of perceived enjoyment in the acceptance of blogging. Data will be collected from respondents in Taiwan to test the research model using structural equation modeling approach. The results of this study will enhance our understanding of students' knowledge sharing behavior through blogging, and provide several prominent implications for e-learning research and practice.},

Since knowledge sharing and reusing can reduce project time and cost, and improve management performance, knowledge management is becoming more important in construction industry than before. However, knowledge is separated and scattered in construction projects and each construction project is managed independently and separately, the knowledge acquisition, and sharing across projects becomes impossible when the employee moves from one company to another. In order to accumulate construction knowledge and reuse it, a conceptual framework of knowledge acquisition and sharing in construction multiple projects for contractors is suggested based on IDEF modeling. The construction knowledge in multiple projects is classified and recognized. Knowledge loss, which is barriers to improve construction management performance, is witnessed in construction project lifecycle and between projects. The web-based construction knowledge system is developed to facilitate knowledge sharing and reusing for the project teams and construction corporations. The construction knowledge system can be used to capture and share both explicit and tacit knowledge under multiple projects for contractors.},

However, the suitability is closely related to size and activity of the project's community. We also investigate whether the type of project (e.g., API, application, product, etc.) matters, and find that given the nature of a forum, projects where the intended users are developers have larger and more active communities and are thus better suited for demand-driven documentation.},

abstract = {Context: In software project management, the decision-making process is a complex set of tasks largely based on human relations and individual knowledge and cultural background. The factors that affect the decisions of the software project managers (SPMs) as well as their potential consequences require attention because project delays and failures might be related to a series of poor decisions. Goals: To understand how SPMs make decisions based on how they interpret their experiences in the workplace. Further, to identify antecedents and consequences of those decisions in order to increase the effectiveness of project management. We also aim to refine the research design for future investigations. Method: Semi-structured interviews were carried out with SPMs within a Brazilian large governmental organization and a Brazilian large private organization. Results: We found that decision-making in software project management is based on knowledge sharing in which the SPM acts as a facilitator. This phenomenon is influenced by individual factors, such as experience, knowledge, personality, organizational ability, communication, negotiation, interpersonal relationship and systemic vision of the project and by situational factors such as the autonomy of the SPM, constant feedback and team members' technical competence. Conclusions: Due to the uncertainty and dynamism inherent to software projects, the SPMs focus on making, monitoring and adjusting decisions in an argument-driven way. From the initial relationships among the identified factors, the research design was refined.},

abstract = {This paper proposes knowledge sharing and cooperation based Adaptive Boosting (KSC-AdaBoost) for supervised collaborative learning in presence of two different feature spaces (views) representing a training example. In such a binary learner space, two learner agents are trained on the two feature spaces. Difficulty of a training example is ascertained not only by classification performance of an individual learner but also by overall group performance on that training example. Group learning is enhanced by a novel algorithm for assigning weight to training set data. Three different models of KSC-AdaBoost are proposed for agglomerating decisions of the two learners. KSC-AdaBoost outperforms traditional AdaBoost and some recent variants of AdaBoost in terms of convergence rate of training set error and generalization accuracy. The paper then presents KSC-AdaBoost based hierarchical model for accurate eye region localization followed by fuzzy rule based system for robust eye center detection. Exhaustive experiments on five publicly available popular datasets reveal the viability of the learning models and superior eye detection accuracy over recent state-of-the-art algorithms.},

These Enterprise Social Networks (ESN) link employees, capture organizational knowledge and support collaboration in virtual teams. Even though ESN intend to break up knowledge silos, improve communication and foster knowledge sharing, their limited ability to cover corporate workows hinders them from realizing their full potential. Information is often scattered either across several systems outside of ESN software or distinct groups and conversations within ESN due to the lack of support of cross-team communication patterns required in complex business processes. To discover gaps we use a real-world example and analyze a critical sales process. Thereafter, extensions to existing software are proposed with the goal to better cover the end-to-end collaboration in virtual teams. We discovered limitations in the group concepts and the mechanisms of sharing content between groups in ESN and conducted a first evaluation of our enhanced concepts with process experts.},

abstract = {In community question and answering sites, pairs of questions and their high-quality answers (like best answers selected by askers) can be valuable knowledge available to others. However lots of questions receive multiple answers but askers do not label either one as the accepted or best one even when some replies answer their questions. To solve this problem, high-quality answer prediction or best answer prediction has been one of important topics in social media. These user-generated answers of ten consist of multiple "views", each capturing different (albeit related) information (e.g., expertise of the asker, length of the answer, etc.). Such views interact with each other in complex manners that should carry a lot of information for distinguishing a potential best answer from others. Little existing work has exploited such interactions for better prediction. To explicitly model these information, we propose a new learning-to-rank method, ranking support vector machine (RankSVM) with weakly hierarchical lasso in this paper. The evaluation of the approach was done using data from Stack Overflow. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach has superior performance compared with approaches in state-of-the-art.},

abstract = {Recently, Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) have emerged as an open learning space with the development of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) and the movement of knowledge sharing. MOOCs are an open online learning space based on unconstrained interaction among learners unlike traditional e-learning systems. Despite the promise of openness in learning, there is lack of research studies to elucidate the accessibility of MOOCs for learners with disabilities. The main goals of this paper are 1) to evaluate the accessibility of MOOCs from the perspective of Universal Design for Learning (UDL) and 2) to identify critical barriers diminishing the accessibility issues. First, we performed a manual testing to evaluate three MOOC platforms (i.e., Coursera, edX, and Khan Academy) on the computer and the mobile platform with the UDL principles. Second, we conducted a user study with four participants with visual impairment. From the walkthrough experience in the interview sessions, we identified critical obstacles in accessibility of MOOCs. The results indicate that the three MOOCs platforms met only 52\% of the 40 UDL categories. Overall, the computer-based MOOC platform received higher accessibility scores than that of the mobile-based MOOC platform though the difference was marginal. Finally, we present four main obstacles related to the low accessibility issues in MOOCs.},

abstract = {A goal of user assisting agents is to provide effective assistance to their users in their tasks. The problem becomes challenging when the users are involved in a cognitive activity such as a knowledge gathering task through the web, and when the agents cannot clearly know the task of their users in advance. The challenge grows when the agent themselves do not possess the knowledge required for such tasks. It is in this scenario that we propose a socio-contextual model of knowledge sharing within a community of user assisting agents, provided through the environment of an open domain knowledge portal, which are used by the users for their web based knowledge gathering tasks. The agents involve themselves in a knowledge sharing exercise by implementing the socio-contextual model that may allow each agent to gain knowledge about a task of their interest from other fellow agents through which they can assist their respective users. We evaluate our model through an experiment involving many knowledge gathering tasks from diverse domains and the results indicate interesting implications of the model with respect to the agents, their tasks and their community.},

abstract = {The work presents a web-based learning system that allows many courses to access and share communities stories, and allows teachers to alter existing scenarios to suit the specific focus of their course. The learning domain is indigenous Graduate Attributes in university curriculum. This knowledge sharing system takes a holistic approach to learning through storytelling and acknowledges that resources collected for one course are often very useful in many other university courses. The combination of stories and the cultural themes that are enacted either as scenarios or agent rules, provide an immersive experience of this culture. This forms both an information sharing medium for Aboriginal communities and a game for non-Aboriginal people. The gaming genre is that or narrative building from community stories, historical scenarios and cultural protocols. At present the features are limited to community authored videos with questions, simple interactions around social protocols and scripted scenarios. This paper looks at how these component can be used for reflective learning through narratives and the need for improved feedback from community, prior to release to students.},

abstract = {Knowledge Sharing is a key enabler of development of the rural poor. ICTs can play a critical role, providing for instance market data or weather information to sustenance farmers, or education to children in remote areas. While advanced knowledge technology has proven its use in many applications in the so-called developed world most of the tools cannot be easily applied in developing countries, because of restricted infrastructure, unsuitable modes of communication or ignorance of the local context. In the K4D tutorial at EKAW 2014 we argued that a new of kind of research in Knowledge Engineering is needed in order to make knowledge technology useful outside privileged developed countries. This research will have to include existing social and economic structures as fundamental requirements in order to be successful. Finally, we claim that this holds for a broader spectrum of subdisciplines of Computer Science, and not just for Knowledge Engineering, which lets us advocate Development Informatics: a joint forum for CS researchers who try to make their research relevant for the developing world as well.},

Models and simulations each have unique affordances and limitations, and it is useful to leverage their affordances to mitigate their respective limitations. One way to do this is by generating the simulations based on the conceptual models, preserving the capacity for rapid revision and knowledge sharing allowed by the conceptual models while extending them to provide the repeated testing and feedback of the simulations. In this paper, we present an interactive system called MILAfiS for generating agent-based simulations from conceptual models of ecological systems. Designed with STEM education in mind, this user-centered interface design allows the user to construct a Component-Mechanism-Phenomenon conceptual model of a complex system, and then compile the conceptual model into an executable NetLogo simulation. In this paper, we present the results of a pilot study with this interface with about 50 middle school students in the context of learning about ecosystems.},

abstract = {Stack Overflow (SO) is the most popular question-and-answer website for software developers, providing a large amount of code snippets and free-form text on a wide variety of topics. Like other software artifacts, questions and answers on SO evolve over time, for example when bugs in code snippets are fixed, code is updated to work with a more recent library version, or text surrounding a code snippet is edited for clarity. To be able to analyze how content on SO evolves, we built SOTorrent, an open dataset based on the official SO data dump. SOTorrent provides access to the version history of SO content at the level of whole posts and individual text or code blocks. It connects SO posts to other platforms by aggregating URLs from text blocks and by collecting references from GitHub files to SO posts. In this paper, we describe how we built SOTorrent, and in particular how we evaluated 134 different string similarity metrics regarding their applicability for reconstructing the version history of text and code blocks. Based on a first analysis using the dataset, we present insights into the evolution of SO posts, e.g., that post edits are usually small, happen soon after the initial creation of the post, and that code is rarely changed without also updating the surrounding text. Further, our analysis revealed a close relationship between post edits and comments. Our vision is that researchers will use SOTorrent to investigate and understand the evolution of SO posts and their relation to other platforms such as GitHub.},

abstract = {Stronger engagement and greater participation is often crucial to reach a goal or to solve an issue. Issues like the emerging employee engagement crisis, insufficient knowledge sharing, and chronic procrastination. In many cases we need and search for tools to beat procrastination or to change people's habits. Gamification is the approach to learn from often fun, creative and engaging games. In principle, it is about understanding games and applying game design elements in a non-gaming environments. This offers possibilities for wide area improvements. For example more accurate work, better retention rates and more cost effective solutions by relating motivations for participating as more intrinsic than conventional methods. In the context of Information Retrieval (IR) it is not hard to imagine that many tasks could benefit from gamification techniques. Besides several manual annotation tasks of data sets for IR research, user participation is important in order to gather implicit or even explicit feedback to feed the algorithms. Gamification, however, comes with its own challenges and its adoption in IR is still in its infancy. Given the enormous response to the first and second GamifIR workshops that were both co-located with ECIR, and the broad range of topics discussed, we now organized the third workshop at SIGIR 2016 to address a range of emerging challenges and opportunities.},

The fact that individuals from different organizational units work on a common task creates a network that coexists with the functional subdivision of tasks and traditionally rigid hierarchical reporting structures within an organization. Based on empirical data from four project workgroups in Switzerland and the United States, I propose a theoretical model for knowledge sharing in ICT-enabled innovation projects. The model ties together processes and content of knowledge sharing through two task dimensions, each of them subdivided into two phases: (1) Conception and implementation of the project, and (2) Exploration and exploitation of knowledge. I show that the implementation of ICT-enabled innovation projects requires a balanced mix of exploration and exploitation of knowledge, where exploration through sparse networks is more important in the conceptual phase, and exploitation in tightly-bound groups becomes more fruitful in the implementation phase.},

abstract = {Spatial queries in the form of natural language questions have typically been assumed to have unconstrained geographic answers. However, analysis of prototypical spatial questions reveals two important types of constraints that must be considered by spatial question answering systems. First, locational relativity constraints limit answers to a particular location or the user's implied location. Second, domain constraints specify non-geographic locations such as web pages or anatomical sites. In order to detect these constraints, we have conducted a crowd-sourced annotation effort for a set of over 1,200 questions gathered from a community question answering website. We utilize machine learning techniques trained on this data to automatically classify these two types of constraints. We report results nearing 90\% accuracy at locational relativity detection and 76\% accuracy at domain classification using this approach.},

abstract = {The paper presents studies on the improvement and development of cooperation methods for cost optimization in power supply systems using polygeneration technology. A support for cooperating operators, which are responsible for maintenance and supervision of the power supply system, is realized by means of appropriately chosen mathematical models and ontology based knowledge sharing and management idea. Ontology based approach enables various pieces of the integrated system to cooperate more autonomously by optimizing and reducing their need for communication. In effect, the system operators are provided with strictly necessary information on: the functioning of devices, the number of operating states, available control strategies and the actual and expected prices of electricity. Based on this information, the system operators are able to take appropriate decisions leading to cost reduction and to maintain reliability of the power supply system at the desired level for various operating conditions.},

abstract = {This paper builds on action and design research aimed at enhancing scholarly community and conversation in a graduate school setting. In this paper we focus on knowledge sharing (KS) and trust as important factors for building a sustainable online learning community (OLC). Guided by theories of social learning and social networking, we survey graduate students to assess their perceptions of KS and trust in communities of practice (CoPs). These results are compared against posttest results measuring community building and knowledge sharing in a stakeholder-defined OLC. Results indicate that although students' initial assessment of KS and trust in CoPs were low, users perceived high levels of value from a stakeholder-defined OLC. Our research offers a proof-of-concept that stakeholder-defined OLCs provide students with the opportunity to develop knowledge networks, while also providing for individual autonomy over their content. Our results also indicate an intriguing alternative to traditional course management systems (CMS).},

abstract = {Researchers are currently drawn to study projects hosted on GitHub due to its popularity, ease of obtaining data, and its distinctive built-in social features. GitHub has been found to create a transparent development environment, which together with a pull request-based workflow, provides a lightweight mechanism for committing, reviewing and managing code changes. These features impact how GitHub is used and the benefits it provides to teams' development and collaboration. While most of the evidence we have is from GitHub's use in open source software (oss) projects, GitHub is also used in an increasing number of commercial projects. It is unknown how GitHub supports these projects given that GitHub's workflow model does not intuitively fit the commercial development way of working. In this paper, we report findings from an online survey and interviews with GitHub users on how GitHub is used for collaboration in commercial projects. We found that many commercial projects adopted practices that are more typical of oss projects including reduced communication, more independent work, and self-organization. We discuss how GitHub's transparency and popular workflow can promote open collaboration, allowing organizations to increase code reuse and promote knowledge sharing across their teams.},

abstract = {Context: In software project management, the decision-making process is a complex set of tasks largely based on specific knowledge and individual cultural background, as well as human relations. The factors that affect the decisions of the software project managers (SPMs) and their potential consequences require attention because project delays and failures are usually related to a series of poor decisions. Objective: To understand how SPMs make decisions based on how they interpret their experiences in the workplace, and also to identify antecedents and consequences of those decisions in order to increase the effectiveness of project management. Method: Semi-structured interviews were carried out with SPMs within a Brazilian large private organization. The data was analyzed using techniques from grounded theory approach. Results: We found that decision-making in software project management is based on knowledge sharing in which the SPM acts as a facilitator before making decisions. This phenomenon is influenced by individual factors, such as experience, communication, negotiation, self-control and systemic view of the project and by contextual factors such as the autonomy of the SPM and team members' technical competence. Also, these factors are mediated by cognitive biases. Conclusions: Due to the uncertainty and dynamism inherent in software projects, the SPMs focus on making, monitoring and adjusting decisions in an argument-driven way.},

abstract = {Manual annotations, e.g. tags and links, of user generated content in community question answering forums and social media play an important role in making the content searchable. During the active phase of a new question entered into a CQA forum, a moderator or an answerer often has to make a significant effort to manually search for related question threads (which we refer to as documents), that he may consider linking to the current question. This manual effort can be greatly reduced by an automated search process to suggest a list of candidate documents to be linked to the new document. We described our investigation of link recommendation for this task. We approach the problem as an ad-hoc information retrieval (IR) task in which a new document (question) acts as the query and the intention is to retrieve a list of potentially relevant documents (previously asked questions in the forum), which could then be linked (manually) to the new one. In contrast to standard ad-hoc search, two pieces of human annotated additional information, namely the tags of the documents and the known links between existing document pairs, can potentially be used to improve the search quality for new questions. To utilize this additional information, we propose a generative model of tagged documents which jointly estimates the distribution of topics corresponding to each tag of a document along with the likelihood of a document being linked to another one. The model predictions are then incorporated in the query likelihood estimate of a standard language model (LM) of IR. Experiments conducted on three months of a crawled StackOverflow dataset show that utilizing the tag specific topic distributions results in a significant improvement in retrieval of the candidate set of related documents.},

abstract = {Software libraries ease development tasks by allowing client developers to reuse code written by third parties. To perform a specific task, there is usually a large number of libraries that offer the desired functionality. Unfortunately, selecting the appropriate library to use is not straightforward since developers are often unaware of the advantages and disadvantages of each library, and may also care about different characteristics in different situations. In this paper, we introduce the idea of using software metrics to help developers choose the libraries most suited to their needs. We propose creating library comparisons based on several metrics extracted from multiple sources such as software repositories, issue tracking systems, and Q&amp;A websites. By consolidating all of this information in a single website, we enable developers to make informed decisions by comparing metric data belonging to libraries from several domains. Additionally, we will use this website to survey developers about which metrics are the most valuable to them, helping us answer the broader question of what determines library quality. In this short paper, we describe the metrics we propose in our work and present preliminary results, as well as faced challenges.},

abstract = {Web 2.0 has provided organizations remarkable opportunities to improve productivity, gain competitive advantage, and increase participation by engaging a crowd to accomplish tasks at scale. However, establishing and integrating crowd-based systems into organizations is still an open question. The systems and the collaborative processes they enable appear diametrically in dissonance with the norms and culture of collaboration and knowledge sharing in traditional organizations. They require mechanisms for articulation of work, coordination, cooperation, and knowledge co-creation that are fundamentally different from those in current groupwork systems and processes. Building on two workshops hosted at ACM CSCW 2014, we will explore questions such as: How does the shift in organizational work from a closed system with known individuals, to an open and crowd model that requires engagement with an undefined network of people, affect how we conceptualize groupwork? What are the implications for the design of groupwork systems? What can the crowdsourcing research community learn from groupwork systems, or conversely what can groupwork researchers learn from crowdsourcing? How do cultures, motivations, ownership and representation fit into these systems? This workshop will bring together researchers and practitioners in crowdsourcing, social computing, collaborative technologies, organizational science, and workplace research, to discuss the future of groupwork systems in the era of crowdwork with the goal of articulating an agenda for future research.},

abstract = {One of the many effects of social media in software development is the flourishing of very large communities of practice where members share a common interest, such as programming languages, frameworks, and tools. These communities of practice use many different communication channels but little is known about how these communities create, share, and curate knowledge using such channels. In this paper, we report a qualitative study of how one community of practice---the R software development community---creates and curates knowledge associated with questions and answers (Q&amp;A) in two of its main communication channels: the R-tag in Stack Overflow and the R-users mailing list. The results reveal that knowledge is created and curated in two main forms: participatory, where multiple members explicitly collaborate to build knowledge, and crowdsourced, where individuals work independently of each other. The contribution of this paper is a characterization of knowledge types that are exchanged by these communities of practice, including a description of the reasons why members choose one channel over the other. Finally, this paper enumerates a set of recommendations to assist practitioners in the use of multiple channels for Q&amp;A.},

The lack of clear knowledge boundaries between the acquiring firm and the target firm and critical territories therein can jeopardize knowledge integration in PAI. The case analyses reveal both acquiring and target firms should promptly build and adjust their knowledge boundaries and critical territories, allowing selective, intelligent knowledge sharing and integration. It is also found that critical territory contributes to completing the ever-evolving knowledge cycle by enabling the synthesis and appropriation of PAI knowledge management activities of both the acquiring and target firms. Without the preservation of critical territory, knowledge integration in PAI hampers target firm knowledge management activities and maximum synergy generation, the goal of acquisition.},

abstract = {Following [4] we extend and generalize the game-theoretic model of distributed computing, identifying different utility functions that encompass different potential preferences of players in a distributed system. A good distributed algorithm in the game-theoretic context is one that prohibits the agents (processors with interests) from deviating from the protocol; any deviation would result in the agent losing, i.e., reducing its utility at the end of the algorithm. We distinguish between different utility functions in the context of distributed algorithms, e.g., utilities based on communication preference, solution preference, and output preference. Given these preferences we construct two basic building blocks for game theoretic distributed algorithms, a wake-up building block resilient to any preference and in particular to the communication preference (to which previous wake-up solutions were not resilient), and a knowledge sharing building block that is resilient to any and in particular to solution and output preferences. Using the building blocks we present several new algorithms for consensus, and renaming as well as a modular presentation of the leader election algorithm of [4].},

abstract = {Sharing knowledge for multiple related machine learning tasks is an effective strategy to improve the generalization performance. In this paper, we investigate knowledge sharing across categories for action recognition in videos. The motivation is that many action categories are related, where common motion pattern are shared among them (e.g. diving and high jump share the jump motion). We propose a new multi-task learning method to learn latent tasks shared across categories, and reconstruct a classifier for each category from these latent tasks. Compared to previous methods, our approach has two advantages: (1) The learned latent tasks correspond to basic motion patterns instead of full actions, thus enhancing discrimination power of the classifiers. (2) Categories are selected to share information with a sparsity regularizer, avoiding falsely forcing all categories to share knowledge. Experimental results on multiple public data sets show that the proposed approach can effectively transfer knowledge between different action categories to improve the performance of conventional single task learning methods.},

abstract = {Communities of Practice (CoPs) are groups of experts who share a common interest or topic and collectively want to deepen their knowledge. The use of CoPs is one of the practices that agile practitioner literature suggests for knowledge sharing and coordination in large-scale agile software development. Even though CoPs are largely used and studied in other industrial contexts, their usage in industrial large-scale software development has not received much research attention. In this paper we describe our findings from a case study of a large software development organization that successfully used CoPs to support their large-scale agile implementation, as well as their transformation from the waterfall model to Lean and Agile. In this case, the use of CoPs was one of the a key success factors. To advance both research and practice we suggest that future research should pay more attention on CoPs in large-scale agile, e.g. By studying how CoPs should be cultivated in the organization, how they work in practice, what they are used for, as well as the benefits and challenges of cultivating and implementing CoPs.},

abstract = {An increasingly common feature of online communities and social media sites is a mechanism for rewarding user achievements based on a system of badges. Badges are given to users for particular contributions to a site, such as performing a certain number of actions of a given type. They have been employed in many domains, including news sites like the Huffington Post, educational sites like Khan Academy, and knowledge-creation sites like Wikipedia and Stack Overflow. At the most basic level, badges serve as a summary of a user's key accomplishments; however, experience with these sites also shows that users will put in non-trivial amounts of work to achieve particular badges, and as such, badges can act as powerful incentives. Thus far, however, the incentive structures created by badges have not been well understood, making it difficult to deploy badges with an eye toward the incentives they are likely to create.In this paper, we study how badges can influence and steer user behavior on a site---leading both to increased participation and to changes in the mix of activities a user pursues on the site. We introduce a formal model for reasoning about user behavior in the presence of badges, and in particular for analyzing the ways in which badges can steer users to change their behavior. To evaluate the main predictions of our model, we study the use of badges and their effects on the widely used Stack Overflow question-answering site, and find evidence that their badges steer behavior in ways closely consistent with the predictions of our model. Finally, we investigate the problem of how to optimally place badges in order to induce particular user behaviors. Several robust design principles emerge from our framework that could potentially aid in the design of incentives for a broad range of sites.},

abstract = {Community Question and Answering (CQA) is a well-known platform for knowledge sharing and social learning. CQA services have expanded into the education sector, where school students are the main users. Here, CQA functions as a non-traditional learning environment in which students use their own knowledge to construct the knowledge base. However, there have been cases where some questions are not answered within such a Q&amp;A system. This failure may occur if a question is unclear, complex, inappropriate, or unrelated to the subject in which it is contextualized. While experts do not answer posted questions, co-users moderate responses and help maintain answer quality. However, due to the presence of users from diverse cultural and linguistic backgrounds, many questions remain unanswered. The current study analyzes and explores the failed questions collected from Brainly, a social learning Q&amp;A platform for school students. The quality of 1,000 questions extracted from this service is analyzed based on human-based ratings and extracted textual features. The findings show that a relationship can be drawn between the non-textual assessment results and the objective textually extracted features. This further encourages the study of why a question might be of poor quality. The findings also show which subjects contain the highest number of unanswered questions. These results will further help us to understand how questions should be restructured to obtain answers from their askers' peers.},

abstract = {The success of technology enhanced learning (TEL) depends on the careful design of digital media and related communication/collaboration features. Particulary when designing learning environments for professionals and scientists in non-technical disciplines it is crucial that the system is capable of reflecting the nature of learning discourses in these domains. For that purpose, it is necessary to fully understand the occuring digital media operations and knowledge sharing aspects involved in the learning process. TEL environments therefore need to reflect the nature of the underlying community processes and their discourses. This paper describes a media theroretical approach to TEL, which is capable of synthesizing media operations and knowledge sharing aspects involved in TEL. On top of this theoretical framing we introduce our Virtual Campfire system as a platform for TEL in nontechnical disciplines. As a proof of concept, the system is being presented in two different non-technical disciplines: Cultural heritage management and entrepreneurial training.},

abstract = {Community question answering (cQA), which provides a platform for people with diverse background to share information and knowledge, has become an increasingly popular research topic. In this paper, we focus on the task of question retrieval. The key problem of question retrieval is to measure the similarity between the queried questions and the historical questions which have been solved by other users. The traditional methods measure the similarity based on the bag-of-words (BOWs) representation. This representation neither captures dependencies between related words, nor handles synonyms or polysemous words. In this work, we first propose a way to build a concept thesaurus based on the semantic relations extracted from the world knowledge of Wikipedia. Then, we develop a unified framework to leverage these semantic relations in order to enhance the question similarity in the concept space. Experiments conducted on a real cQA data set show that with the help of Wikipedia thesaurus, the performance of question retrieval is improved as compared to the traditional methods.},

In this study, we adopt a social network perspective to identify and hypothesize that three microblogging network mechanisms will positively affect OSS project success through knowledge sharing, and attracting more skillful and eminent developers. Using longitudinal data from a large online OSS community called Ohloh, we empirically examine the impacts of various factors for these two type of mechanisms on the commercial and technological successes of OSS projects. We found that preferential attachment and structure hole factors are supported, while accumulative advantage factors are partially supported. Our findings may provide insights for OSS stakeholders to effectively manage microblogging techniques for achieving project success.},

To evaluate this approach, we collect approximately ten thousand CQA queries, whose answers contained links to ClueWeb09 documents after spam filtering. Experimental results using this collection show that the relative effectiveness between different retrieval models on the ClueWeb-CQA query set is consistent with that on the TREC Web Track query sets, confirming the reliability of our test collection. Further analysis shows that the large number of queries generated through this approach compensates for the sparse relevance judgments in determining significant differences.},

Researchers tend to generalize problems and solutions, however, practitioners and instructors frequently need to identify real low-level scenarios and patterns in an effort to study specific problems and their solutions. We propose a method for collecting and defining GSD scenarios and related patterns. Scenarios depicting events that happen in certain GSD contexts associated with communication, coordination are central to this method. In this paper we show how problems and solutions extracted from these events can lead to the definition of patterns. Patterns describe generalized information that can be re-used in similar contexts. To facilitate knowledge sharing, we have integrated this pattern model into a GSD Community Web intended to promote collaboration between industry and academia.

This search technique allows programmers to easily navigate complex and large APIs in order to find the definitions they are interested in. While there exist some effective approaches to address type-directed API search for functional languages, we observed that none of these have been successfully adapted for use with statically-typed, object-oriented languages. The challenge here is incorporating large and unified inheritance hierarchies and the resulting prevalence of subtyping into an API retrieval model. We describe a new approach to API retrieval and provide an implementation thereof for the Scala language. Our evaluation with queries mined from Q&amp;A websites shows that the model retrieves definitions from the Scala standard library with 94\% of the relevant results in the top 10.},

Basically software agents can encode users profiles with detailed information to be related with specific groups. This work discusses a multi-agent framework whose structure focuses on the role of software agents and the use of a common, shared dictionary for each group. Personal software agents are associated to OSN users to share knowledge for a specific theme for a number of groups related to that topic. Group agents are defined to support each group on each OSN by interacting with personal agents to manage group affiliation and enrich the common dictionaries of their own groups. The common dictionary of the group is a key element to provide knowledge sharing and interoperability between personal and group agents. In the proposed approach each user agent is able to personalize its own dictionary and enrich that of its own groups by means of selected categories.},

abstract = {Virtual teams, with a high level of interdependence and cooperation among team members, are the building block of successful global software organizations. While becoming agile helps on communication and collaboration, such teams meet several challenges in the form of cultural differences, language barriers, national traditions, different values and norms, lack of face-to-face communication, time-zone differences, and difficulties in building and maintaining trust. A successful agile virtual team needs to have the right structure, but equally important is the ability to improve as a team, to become self-managing with shared decision-making and shared leadership. It takes a long time to form such a team, and expert coaching is needed. We describe and discuss how one team leader coached and improved a global virtual agile team at a large savings and insurance company over a period of one year. Because the team members had overlapping working hours the team was able to base coordination on mutual adjustment and frequent feedback. Social software and face-to-face meetings were important factors to achieve this. By involving the remote developers in the strategy of the product, enabling everyone to pick their own tasks, and focusing on continuous learning, knowledge sharing and team build activities, the team members became highly motivated and self-managing.},

abstract = {NASA Earth Exchange (NEX) aims to provide a platform to enable and facilitate scientific collaboration and knowledge sharing in the Earth sciences, as current satellite measurements rapidly magnify the accumulation of more than 40 years of NASA datasets. One of the main objectives of NEX is to help Earth scientists leverage and reuse various data processing software modules developed by their peers, in order to quickly run value-added executable experiments (workflows). Toward this goal, this paper reports our efforts of leveraging social network analysis to intelligently extract hidden information from data processing workflows. By modeling Earth science workflow modules as social entities and their dependencies as social relationships, this research opens up new vistas for applying social science to facilitate software reuse and distributed workflow development. As a proof of concept, a prototyping system has been developed as a plug-in to the NEX workflow design and management system (VisTrails) to aid Earth scientists in discovering and reusing workflow modules and extending them to solve more complex science problems.},

abstract = {Modern IDEs contain sophisticated components for inferring missing types, correcting bad syntax and completing partial expressions in code, but they are limited to the context that is explicitly defined in a project's configuration. These tools are ill-suited for quick prototyping of incomplete code snippets, such as those found on the Web in Q&amp;A forums or walk-through tutorials, since such code snippets often assume the availability of external dependencies and may even contain implicit references to an execution environment that provides data or compute services.We propose an architecture for smart programming playgrounds that can facilitate rapid prototyping of incomplete code snippets through a semi-automatic context resolution that involves identifying static dependencies, provisioning external resources on the cloud and injecting resource bindings to handles in the original code fragment.Such a system could be potentially useful in a range of different scenarios, from sharing code snippets on the Web to experimenting with new ideas during traditional software development.},

abstract = {Background Software developers are increasingly required to write concurrent code. However, most developers find concurrent programming difficult. To better help developers, it is imperative to understand their interest and difficulties in terms of concurrency topics they encounter often when writing concurrent code.Aims In this work, we conduct a large-scale study on the textual content of the entirety of Stack Overflow to understand the interests and difficulties of concurrency developers.Method First, we develop a set of concurrency tags to extract concurrency questions that developers ask. Second, we use latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) topic modeling and an open card sort to manually determine the topics of these questions. Third, we construct a topic hierarchy by repeated grouping of similar topics into categories and lower level categories into higher level categories. Fourth, we investigate the coincidence of our concurrency topics with findings of previous work. Fifth, we measure the popularity and difficulty of our concurrency topics and analyze their correlation. Finally, we discuss the implications of our findings.Results A few findings of our study are the following. (1) Developers ask questions about a broad spectrum of concurrency topics ranging from multithreading to parallel computing, mobile concurrency to web concurrency and memory consistency to run-time speedup. (2) These questions can be grouped into a hierarchy with eight major categories: concurrency models, programming paradigms, correctness, debugging, basic concepts, persistence, performance and GUI. (3) Developers ask more about correctness of their concurrent programs than performance. (4) Concurrency questions about thread safety and database management systems are among the most popular and the most difficult, respectively. (5) Difficulty and popularity of concurrency topics are negatively correlated.Conclusions The results of our study can not only help concurrency developers but also concurrency educators and researchers to better decide where to focus their efforts, by trading off one concurrency topic against another.},

CoP are known for knowledge sharing and learning. In this paper we argue that CoP supported by social media have great potential to contribute to business objectives. This investigation is an embedded case study that includes 54 CoP within a prominent Engineering multinational firm. The investigation explores the extent to which the 54 CoP contribute to business objectives. The paper's contribution is in providing five guidelines for practice that outline how CoP can be best designed to contribute to business objectives and how social media can serve as the vehicle through which to execute those guidelines.},

In that matter, IS researchers have mostly focused on macro level analyses. We address this by developing a multilevel model for investigating the impact of organizational social web site (SWS) usage on individual and team performance. Our paper addresses this gap by drawing on existing guidelines for multilevel theorizing. We propose that team SWS usage impacts individual and team performance through its improved structural collaboration capabilities. Organizational learning, social capital, and network theories serve as the theoretical basis. Ultimately, we present a multilevel model as the foundation for future empirical research. Our research's contribution lies in the theoretical derivation of a multilevel model.},

Some of the most significant problems in communication are the lack of reciprocity and fast response, especially in distributed environments. Communication should be motivated and maintained through the project development. Early media such as e-mail and forums do not possess such source of motivation and synchronization. New media such as Facebook and G+ have such elements that motivate team members, especially young developers, to remain online facilitating the communication just in time. In this paper we present some experiences using the most popular social media such as Facebook, G+, Skype, and Dropbox in developing software projects. Our study presents statistics of what kinds of communication and coordination issues are properly implemented using Facebook. Based on this, we present an initial set of metrics to assess how communication, coordination and knowledge sharing are implemented in these kinds of distributed environments.},

abstract = {Stack Overflow (SO) is the most popular online Q&amp;A site for developers to share their expertise in solving programming issues. Given multiple answers to a certain question, developers may take the accepted answer, the answer from a person with high reputation, or the one frequently suggested. However, researchers recently observed that SO contains exploitable security vulnerabilities in the suggested code of popular answers, which found their way into security-sensitive high-profile applications that millions of users install every day. This observation inspires us to explore the following questions: How much can we trust the security implementation suggestions on SO? If suggested answers are vulnerable, can developers rely on the community's dynamics to infer the vulnerability and identify a secure counterpart?To answer these highly important questions, we conducted a comprehensive study on security-related SO posts by contrasting secure and insecure advice with the community-given content evaluation. Thereby, we investigated whether SO's gamification approach on incentivizing users is effective in improving security properties of distributed code examples. Moreover, we traced the distribution of duplicated samples over given answers to test whether the community behavior facilitates or prevents propagation of secure and insecure code suggestions within SO.We compiled 953 different groups of similar security-related code examples and labeled their security, identifying 785 secure answer posts and 644 insecure answer posts. Compared with secure suggestions, insecure ones had higher view counts (36,508 vs. 18,713), received a higher score (14 vs. 5), and had significantly more duplicates (3.8 vs. 3.0) on average. 34\% of the posts provided by highly reputable so-called trusted users were insecure.Our findings show that based on the distribution of secure and insecure code on SO, users being laymen in security rely on additional advice and guidance. However, the community-given feedback does not allow differentiating secure from insecure choices. The reputation mechanism fails in indicating trustworthy users with respect to security questions, ultimately leaving other users wandering around alone in a software security minefield.},

abstract = {Future software systems will be highly dynamic. We are already experiencing, for example, a world where Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) play a more and more crucial role. CPSs integrate computational, physical, and networking elements, they comprise a number of subsystems, or entities, that are connected and work together. The open and highly distributed nature of the resulting system gives rise to unanticipated runtime management issues such as the organization of subsystems and resource optimization. In this paper, we focus on the problem of knowledge sharing among cooperating entities of a highly distributed and self-adaptive CPS. Specifically, the research question we address is how to minimize the knowledge that needs to be shared among the entities of a CPS. If all entities share all their knowledge with each other, the performance, energy and memory consumption as well as privacy are unnecessarily negatively impacted. To reduce the amount of knowledge to share between CPS entities, we envision a role-based adaptive knowledge exchange technique working on partial runtime models, i.e., Models reflecting only part of the state of the CPS. Our approach supports two adaptation dimensions: the runtime type of knowledge and conditions over the knowledge. We illustrate the feasibility of our technique by discussing its realization based on two state-of-the-art approaches.},

To date, many pieces of work have examined engagement dynamics in isolated platforms with little consideration or assessment of how these dynamics might vary between disparate social media systems. Additionally, such explorations have often used different features and notions of engagement, thus rendering the cross-platform comparison of engagement dynamics limited. In this paper we define a common framework of engagement analysis and examine and compare engagement dynamics, using replying as our chosen engagement modality, across five social media platforms: Facebook, Twitter, Boards.ie, Stack Overflow and the SAP Community Network. We define a variety of common features (social and content) to capture the dynamics that correlate with engagement in multiple social media platforms, and present an evaluation pipeline intended to enable cross-platform comparison.Our comparison results demonstrate the varying factors at play in different platforms, while also exposing several similarities.},

year = {2015},
publisher = {IEEE Press},
abstract = {Future software systems will be highly dynamic. We are already experiencing, for example, a world where Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) play a more and more crucial role. CPSs integrate computational, physical, and networking elements; they comprise a number of subsystems, or entities, that are connected and work together. The open and highly distributed nature of the resulting system gives rise to unanticipated runtime management issues such as the organization of subsystems and resource optimization.In this paper, we focus on the problem of knowledge sharing among cooperating entities of a highly distributed and self-adaptive CPS. Specifically, the research question we address is how to minimize the knowledge that needs to be shared among the entities of a CPS. If all entities share all their knowledge with each other, the performance, energy and memory consumption as well as privacy are unnecessarily negatively impacted. To reduce the amount of knowledge to share between CPS entities, we envision a role-based adaptive knowledge exchange technique working on partial runtime models, i.e., models reflecting only part of the state of the CPS. Our approach supports two adaptation dimensions: the runtime type of knowledge and conditions over the knowledge. We illustrate the feasibility of our technique by discussing its realization based on two state-of-the-art approaches.},

Naturally, these sites are the product of contributors acting in different ways - creating questions, answers or comments and voting in these - contributing in diverse amounts, and creating content of varying quality. This paper advances present knowledge about Q&amp;A sites using a multifaceted view of contributors that accounts for diversity of behavior, motivation and expertise to characterize their profiles in five sites. This characterization resulted in the definition of ten behavioral profiles that group users according to the quality and quantity of their contributions. Using these profiles, we find that the five sites have remarkably similar distributions of contributor profiles. We also conduct a longitudinal study of contributor profiles in one of the sites, identifying common profile transitions, and finding that although users change profiles with some frequency, the site composition is mostly stable over time.},

abstract = {Associating assessment items with hypothesized knowledge components (KCs) enables us to gain fine-grained data on students’ performance within an ed-tech system. However, creating this association is a time consuming process and requires substantial instructor effort. In this study, we present the results of crowdsourcing valuable insights into the underlying concepts of problems in mathematics and English writing, as a first step in leveraging the crowd to expedite the task of generating KCs. We presented crowdworkers with two problems in each domain and asked them to provide three explanations about why one problem is more challenging than the other. These explanations were then independently analyzed through (1) a series of qualitative coding methods and (2) several topic modeling techniques, to compare how they might assist in extracting KCs and other insights from the participant contributions. Results of our qualitative coding showed that crowdworkers were able to generate KCs that approximately matched those generated by domain experts. At the same time, the topic models’ outputs were evaluated against both the domain expert generated KCs and the results of the previous coding to determine effectiveness. Ultimately we found that while the topic modeling was not up to parity with the qualitative coding methods, it did assist in identifying useful clusters of explanations. This work demonstrates a method to leverage both the crowd’s knowledge and topic modeling to assist in the process of generating KCs for assessment items.},

However, these traditional techniques only consider the link structure while ignore the topical similarity among users (askers and answerers) and user expertise and user reputation. In this study, we propose a topic-sensitive probabilistic model, which is an extension of PageRank algorithm to find experts in CQA. Compared to the traditional link analysis techniques, our proposed method is more effective because it finds the experts by taking into account both the link structure and the topical similarity among users. We conduct experiments on real world data set from Yahoo! Answers. Experimental results show that our proposed method significantly outperforms the traditional link analysis techniques and achieves the state-of-the-art performance for expert finding in CQA.},

abstract = {Various online social networks (OSNs) have been developed rapidly on the Internet. Researchers have analyzed different properties of such OSNs, mainly focusing on the formation and evolution of the networks as well as the information propagation over the networks. In knowledge-sharing OSNs, such as blogs and question answering systems, issues on how users participate in the network and how users "generate/contribute" knowledge are vital to the sustained and healthy growth of the networks. However, related discussions have not been reported in the research literature.In this work, we empirically study workloads from three popular knowledge-sharing OSNs, including a blog system, a social bookmark sharing network, and a question answering social network to examine these properties. Our analysis consistently shows that (1) users' posting behavior in these networks exhibits strong daily and weekly patterns, but the user active time in these OSNs does not follow exponential distributions; (2) the user posting behavior in these OSNs follows stretched exponential distributions instead of power-law distributions, indicating the influence of a small number of core users cannot dominate the network; (3) the distributions of user contributions on high-quality and effort-consuming contents in these OSNs have smaller stretch factors for the stretched exponential distribution. Our study provides insights into user activity patterns and lays out an analytical foundation for further understanding various properties of these OSNs.},

However, the centralized knowledge management systems may sometimes cause problems in sharing knowledge. One potential solution is to conduct KS in a decentralized network supported by peer-to-peer technology. While extensive research has been done to address the flaws of current reputation-based feedback mechanisms for promoting knowledge diffusion in peer-to-peer communities, some serious drawbacks of feedback mechanisms, namely dimensionality and interaction-dependency effects, have been overlooked. Using an agent-based simulation, this paper examines these effects while also considering characteristics of the community. Results of our simulation show interesting findings, for example, that negligence of knowledge dimensionality and interaction-dependency in designing reputation mechanisms has a major negative effect on community knowledge performance. Further, more complex knowledge adversely affects community-level diffusion outcomes whereas greater network density improves them.},

abstract = {The paradigm of shared decision making in patient-physician relationships is well documented. Moreover, it is an integral aspect of sound patient centric healthcare delivery. Implementing such an approach within established healthcare processes has yet to be successfully realized. This void is causing problems in healthcare delivery in particular in EU countries such as Germany because knowledge sources are distributed and underlie strict privacy policies, while the lack of adequate shared decision making compromises the quality of healthcare delivery and can lead to errors and inefficient workflow. This paper serves to analyze the provision of personal guidance services for shared decision making in eHealth service networks. By doing so, we address the problem of distributed and privacy-aware knowledge sharing by the formation of agent-based organizations to represent the relationships of patients and physicians and study this problem from the perspective of multiagent systems, i.e. we develop technology enabled collaboration solutions. The efficacy of the proffered decision support system will be demonstrated by a scenario-based evaluation. We contend that such an approach will address the current void.},

In order to be sure that they understand each other, systems use concept learning to learn the meaning of concepts they communicate with. In this paper, we try to overcome this complexity by suggesting a system that enables agents to learn new concepts from several different agents at the same time and each agent has its own ontology.

Using a combined theoretical lens of the process/knowledge continuum and boundary spanning, this research analyses an interesting case of BP ownership found in a real-life healthcare organization. Our results show that knowledge-intensive BPs, at least in the case organization, do require a different type of BP ownership than the one found in the BPM literature published over the past two decades. Rather than being focused on management and control, ownership of knowledge-intensive BPs is found to involve knowledge sharing, boundary-spanning, shared responsibility and grass-root leadership.},

abstract = {We use Yahoo! Toolbar data to gain insights into why people use Q&amp;A sites. We look at questions asked on Yahoo! Answers and analyze both the pre-question behavior of users as well as their general online behavior. Our results indicate that there is a one-dimensional spectrum of users ranging from "social users" to "informational users" and that web search and Q&amp;A sites complement each other, rather than compete. Concerning the pre-question behavior, users who first issue a question-related query are more likely to issue informational questions, rather than conversational ones, and such questions are less likely to attract an answer. Finally, we only find weak evidence for topical congruence between a user's questions and his web queries.},

Consequently, it makes the emergency domain knowledge standardization and semantization, so convenient for knowledge sharing and reuse. And on that basis, the rules which drilling accident emergency decision needs are established by using the SWRL rule language, implementing the ontology-based rule knowledge reasoning through the Jena reasoning machine. This can provide auxiliary schemes for rescuing emergency accidents.

abstract = {We analyze the question queries submitted to a large commercial web search engine to get insights about what people ask, and to better tailor the search results to the users' needs. Based on a dataset of about one billion question queries submitted during the year 2012, we investigate askers' querying behavior with the support of automatic query categorization. While the importance of question queries is likely to increase, at present they only make up 3-4\% of the total search traffic.Since questions are such a small part of the query stream, and are more likely to be unique than shorter queries, click-through information is typically rather sparse. Thus, query categorization methods based on the categories of clicked web documents do not work well for questions. As an alternative, we propose a robust question query classification method that uses the labeled questions from a large community question answering platform (CQA) as a training set. The resulting classifier is then transferred to the web search questions. Even though questions on CQA platforms tend to be different to web search questions, our categorization method proves competitive with strong baselines with respect to classification accuracy.To show the scalability of our proposed method we apply the classifiers to about one billion question queries and discuss the trade-offs between performance and accuracy that different classification models offer.},

abstract = {Community question answering (CQA) services provide an open platform for people to share their knowledge and have attracted great attention for its rapidly increasing popularity. As the more knowledge people provided are shared in CQA, how to use the historical knowledge for solving new questions has become a crucial problem. In this paper, we investigate the problem as predicting best responders for new questions and tackle the problem from two perspectives, one is from the asker of the new question, and the other is from the question itself. We propose two supervised topic models, Asker-Responder Topic Model (ARTM) and Question-Responder Topic Model (QRTM) for both two perspectives by tracking people's answering history as background knowledge. Our experiments show that the two supervised topic models can effectively predict best responders for new questions in CQA without any additional works and have significant improvement over the baseline method.},

Recent endeavors of this kind include academic research projects such as DBpedia, KnowItAll, Probase, ReadTheWeb, and YAGO, as well as industrial ones such as Freebase and Trueknowledge. These projects provide automatically constructed knowledge bases of facts about named entities, their semantic classes, and their mutual relationships. Such world knowledge in turn enables cognitive applications and knowledge-centric services like disambiguating natural-language text, deep question answering, and semantic search for entities and relations in Web and enterprise data. Prominent examples of how knowledge bases can be harnessed include the Google Knowledge Graph and the IBM Watson question answering system. This tutorial presents state-of-the-art methods, recent advances, research opportunities, and open challenges along this avenue of knowledge harvesting and its applications.},

abstract = {Deprecation allows the developers of application programming interfaces (APIs) to signal to other developers that a given API item ought to be avoided. But little is known about deprecation practices beyond anecdotes. We examine how API deprecation has been used in 26 open source Java frameworks and libraries, finding that the classic deprecate–replace–remove cycle is often not followed, as many APIs were removed without prior deprecation, many deprecated APIs were subsequently un-deprecated, and removed APIs are even resurrected with surprising frequency. Furthermore, we identify several problems in the information commonly (not) provided to help API consumers transition their dependent code.  As a consequence of deprecation, coding examples on the web --- an increasingly important source of information for developers --- can easily become outdated. Code examples that demonstrate how to use deprecated APIs can be difficult to disregard and a waste of time for developers. We propose a lightweight, version-sensitive framework to detect deprecated API usages in source code examples on the web so developers can be informed of such usages before they invest time and energy into studying them. We reify the framework as a prototype tool (Deprecation Watcher). Our evaluation on detecting deprecated Android API usages in code examples on Stack Overflow shows our tool obtains a precision of 100\% and a recall of 86\% in a random sample of 200 questions.},

address = {USA},
abstract = {Sharing and reuse of scientific data, which can enhance the transparency and reproducibility of research and lead to the creation of new knowledge from existing data, is both a growing scholarly communication practice and an expanding area of interest in information science. However, much of the literature to date has focused on the data practices of scientists working in academic environments, with less research done on understanding the practices of scientists working in other types of environments, such as government or industry. This poster presents the results of a study in which data from a worldwide survey of scientists were analyzed to determine if differences in data practices, perceptions, and access to resources for data sharing existed between scientists who reported their primary work sector as academic and those who reported a non-academic primary work sector. Researchers' perceptions of data sharing and reuse were generally positive and did not differ significantly by work sector. However, differences were found in actual reported data sharing practices, even when controlling for researchers' age, geographic location, and subject discipline. Researchers outside of academia had lesser odds of reporting sharing all their data. Differences were also found in reported barriers to data sharing, as well as in reported access to and use of data sharing resources, suggesting that data sharing challenges faced by scientists working outside of academia may differ from those faced by their academic peers. Implications for the adoption of data sharing practices and technologies, as well as for knowledge sharing and creation across work sectors, are discussed, and suggestions are offered for further research.},

However, this abstraction does not come for free: understanding how to use an API can be difficult. While API documentation can help, it is often insufficient on its own. Online sites like Stack Overflow and Github Gists have grown to fill the gap between traditional API documentation and more example-based resources. Unfortunately, these two important classes of documentation are independent.  In this paper we describe an iterative, deductive method of linking source code examples to API documentation. We also present an implementation of this method, called Baker, that is highly precise (0.97) and supports both Java and JavaScript. Baker can be used to enhance traditional API documentation with up-to-date source code examples; it can also be used to incorporate links to the API documentation into the code snippets that use the API.},

abstract = {Textual problem-solution repositories are available today in various forms, most commonly as problem-solution pairs from community question answering systems. Modern search engines that operate on the web can suggest possible completions in real-time for users as they type in queries. We study the problem of generating intelligent query suggestions for users of customized search systems that enable querying over problem-solution repositories. Due to the small scale and specialized nature of such systems, we often do not have the luxury of depending on query logs for finding query suggestions. We propose a retrieval model for generating query suggestions for search on a set of problem solution pairs. We harness the problem solution partition inherent in such repositories to improve upon traditional query suggestion mechanisms designed for systems that search over general textual corpora. We evaluate our technique over real problem-solution datasets and illustrate that our technique provides large and statistically significant improvements over the state-of-the-art technique in query suggestion.},

This work was motivated by proposing new ways of achieving 3D CAD tasks not only for highly complex and temporary organization in the design stages but also for the whole lifecycle of such installations, which may last several decades. in this particular scenario, it is very important to share the right information with the right stakeholder at the right time, to maintain a high level of knowledge sharing. Taking into account these challenges, we propose a first implementation of interactive 3D CAD editing tools, based on the X3DOM technology and driven by a knowledge layer which utilizes a complete reference data and rules management system. To store the CAD models, a Macro-Parametric Approach has been investigated and a 3D server has been added to the traditional PDM (Product or Plant Data Management) to execute remotely complex CAD operations. This is a very promising start to deploy lightweight and smart web3D CAD editing services for the AEC (Architecture Engineering Construction) and power industries.},

As the availability of such content increases, the task of identifying high-quality content sites based on user contributions --social media sites -- becomes increasingly important. Social media in general exhibit a rich variety of information sources: in addition to the content itself, there is a wide array of non-content information available, such as links between items and explicit quality ratings from members of the community. In this paper we investigate methods for exploiting such community feedback to automatically identify high quality content. As a test case, we focus on Yahoo! Answers, a large community question/answering portal that is particularly rich in the amount and types of content and social interactions available in it. We introduce a general classification framework for combining the evidence from different sources of information, that can be tuned automatically for a given social media type and quality definition. In particular, for the community question/answering domain, we show that our system is able to separate high-quality items from the rest with an accuracy close to that of humans},

The aim is to learn to use expert coordination knowledge to restrict the joint action space and to direct exploration towards more promising states, thereby improving the overall learning rate. We model such coordination knowledge as constraints and propose a two-level RL system that utilizes these constraints for online applications. Our declarative approach towards specifying coordination in multi-agent learning allows knowledge sharing between constraints and features (basis functions) for function approximation. Results on a soccer game and a tactical real-time strategy game show that coordination constraints improve the learning rate compared to using only unary constraints. The two-level RL system also outperforms existing single-level approach that utilizes joint action selection via coordination graphs.},

abstract = {Community Question Answering (CQA) has emerged recently and it becomes popular among people. During the process of the communication, different knowledge can be merged. Recently, several vendors use the business model of paying for knowledge to make these knowledge to the monetary benefits, then the Pay-for-Knowledge Communities (PKC) have been applied. Even PKC has interesting business model, there are several problems to be solved, and one of the most salient problem is that questioners may takes too long time to choose the most valuable answers, leading to questioners not able to pay for suitable answerers and many problems about platforms' operation There are several previous research has focused on this problem but still have not found satisfactory solutions as questions and answers are more and more complex in PKC platforms. With the development of cognitive computing techniques, applying an intelligent QA system in PKC to improve the answering effectiveness may be possible. In this paper, we tried to investigate how to apply the intelligent QA system into PKC platform to improve the answering effectiveness. For solving the problems of matching complex questions and answers, we present a Four Module QA Model based on the normal intelligent QA System. Compared to normal intelligent QA System, our model uses categories to classify the questions with traditional machine learning methods. We use answers in each category of corresponding questions as one dataset, answers in each entity of corresponding question as the other dataset, finally, these two datasets make up the document database. Then we got the best answer among past answers through comparing the TF-IDF weighted bag-of word vectors of two datasets or the new answer including key words through Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) algorithm with PKC's features composed of centrality and money. Experiments were developed on a dataset with 1222 users' QA sites collected from a QA community. The model we proposed is expected to increase QA's effectiveness and improve the business model of Pay-for-Knowledge Communities.},

abstract = {Wikis are a web-based technology that has been adopted in the classroom to allow students to engage in collaborative practices via group work. However, group work can often emphasise product, rather than the processes that lead to the production of an artifact. Furthermore, co-writing activities also cause problems with the clear identification of group member contributions and the assessment of educational objectives. Wikis are implemented in the anticipation that students are applying knowledge, sharing, and engaging in cognitive and metacognitive processes as a group, however, exactly which cognitive and metacognitive processes occur behind the 'edits' of the wiki? This paper examines students' "invisible" behaviours as they co-construct a wiki response to a problem-based learning question.

abstract = {In a knowledge-intensive environment, a task in an organization is typically performed by a group of people who have task-related knowledge and expertise. Document recommendation methods are very useful to resolve the information overload problem and proactively support knowledge workers in the performance of tasks by recommending appropriate documents to meet their information needs. A worker's document referencing behavior can be modeled as a knowledge flow (KF) to represent the evolution of his/her information needs over time. However, the information needs of workers and groups may change over time. Additionally, most traditional recommendation methods which provide personalized recommendations do not consider workers' KFs, or the information needs of the majority of workers in a group to recommend task knowledge. In this work, the group-based collaborative filtering (GCF) method which integrates the KF mining method is proposed to actively provide task-related documents for groups. Experimental results show that the proposed method has better performance than the personalized recommendation methods in recommending the needed documents for groups. The proposed method can fulfill the groups' task needs and facilitate the knowledge sharing among groups.},

abstract = {Stack canaries are a well-known and effective technique for detecting and defeating stack overflow attacks. However, they are not perfect. For programs compiled using gcc, the reference canary value is randomly generated at program invocation and fixed throughout execution. Moreover, for software running on the Linux operating system, canary values are inherited from the parent process and only changed if/when the child process exec()s a different program. Researchers and others have exploited these behaviors to craft real-world attacks that bypass the protections of stack canaries. This paper describes a moving-target stack canary technique that prevents such attacks. The Dynamic Canary Randomization technique (DCR) rerandomizes stack canaries at runtime. DCR is applied directly to the binary using a static binary rewriter (i.e., it does not require access to the program's source code). DCR operates with minimal overhead and gives the user the flexibility to specify the conditions under which to rerandomize the canary. DCR is an improvement over existing canary rerandomizers because it allows rerandomization to be applied at any point during execution and at any frequency. We show that DCR improves software security by demonstrating its ability to prevent real-world attacks on well-known software (e.g., nginx) "protected" by traditional stack canaries.},

abstract = {Cognitive effort and knowledge sharing play a critical role in the successful completion of knowledge intensive collaborative tasks. Such tasks require extensive coordination and sense making to facilitate joint problem solving and the creation of shared mental models. Furthermore, multiple heads often come with multiple stakes and perspectives, which can lead to conflict and often require trust building and negotiation. Therefore, the cognitive load involved in collaborative tasks is likely to be higher than in individual tasks, and requires special attention when designing collaboration support. Understanding cognitive load and cognitive activities involved in collaboration may offer insight into design principles that enable efficient and effective use of cognitive capacity. The intent of this minitrack is to provide an outlet for such research and encourage research that explores the individual cognitive perspective when studying collaboration.},

However, smallholders face significant challenges, often due to a lack of access to information about prices and markets. This paper describes ongoing work on a methodological approach for addressing these challenges through the use of an Android-based mobile-cellular platform application. Using a social networking approach, the application enables smallholders to interact with traders, retailers, consumers, and each other in such a way as to encourage the emergence of sustainable and fair regional markets. It will increase profitability by providing information on price and demand, and enable better cooperation and knowledge-sharing between farmers. This may not only improve yields, but also increase diversity in agricultural products produced: farmers can better adapt to changing climatic conditions and be less vulnerable to volatile commodity prices.},

A tool, which serves for moving away from artifact-centered design to an intentional creation of value, i.e. support interaction designers on further reflecting on trust-enabling interactions design values.These design space's dimensions are rationally derived from the model of Human-computer Trust, which builds on uses perceived trust. This model has been previously validated and was also used as a research lens for providing a greater understanding of how individuals interact with systems, in interaction processes like openness, knowledge sharing, user's privacy awareness, and collaboration.The article concludes with two examples of application through a comparative inspection of 2 peer-production platforms: Wikipedia and Wordpress. And a reflection on how the proposed analytical tool can be used as a facilitator for supporting trust-enabling interaction design processes.},

abstract = {Consider a question and its answers in Stack Overflow as a knowledge unit. Knowledge units often contain semantically relevant knowledge, and thus linkable for different purposes, such as duplicate questions, directly linkable for problem solving, indirectly linkable for related information. Recognizing different classes of linkable knowledge would support more targeted information needs when users search or explore the knowledge base. Existing methods focus on binary relatedness (i.e., related or not), and are not robust to recognize different classes of semantic relatedness when linkable knowledge units share few words in common (i.e., have lexical gap). In this paper, we formulate the problem of predicting semantically linkable knowledge units as a multiclass classification problem, and solve the problem using deep learning techniques. To overcome the lexical gap issue, we adopt neural language model (word embeddings) and convolutional neural network (CNN) to capture word- and document-level semantics of knowledge units. Instead of using human-engineered classifier features which are hard to design for informal user-generated content, we exploit large amounts of different types of user-created knowledge-unit links to train the CNN to learn the most informative word- and sentence-level features for the multiclass classification task. Our evaluation shows that our deep-learning based approach significantly and consistently outperforms traditional methods using traditional word representations and human-engineered classifier features.},

However, enterprise social software platforms (ESSPs) often lack substantial attention. While some research into users' motives to adopt social software in the private realm exists, the body of empirical studies on ESSP adoption is rather limited. Our research objective therefore is to contribute to closing this gap in research by determining the factors influencing employees' ESSP usage. Building on previous research, we present an ESSP adoption model. We then propose an according measurement instrument for empirically assessing the factors influencing ESSP usage. A card sorting and item ranking approach is conducted in order to preliminarily validate the measurement instrument. We eventually suggest methods of classical test theory for the further validation of the measurement instrument and the assessment of the ESSP adoption model.},

abstract = {With Community Question Answering (CQA) evolving into a quite popular method for information seeking and providing, it also becomes a target for spammers to disseminate promotion campaigns. Although there are a number of quality estimation efforts on the CQA platform, most of these works focus on identifying and reducing low-quality answers, which are mostly generated by impatient or inexperienced answerers. However, a large number of promotion answers appear to provide high-quality information to cheat CQA users in future interactions. Therefore, most existing quality estimation works in CQA may fail to detect these specially designed answers or question-answer pairs. In contrast to these works, we focus on the promotion channels of spammers, which include (shortened) URLs, telephone numbers and social media accounts. Spammers rely on these channels to connect to users to achieve promotion goals so they are irreplaceable for spamming activities. We propose a propagation algorithm to diffuse promotion intents on an "answerer-channel" bipartite graph and detect possible spamming activities. A supervised learning framework is also proposed to identify whether a QA pair is spam based on propagated promotion intents. Experimental results based on more than 6 million entries from a popular Chinese CQA portal show that our approach outperforms a number of existing quality estimation methods for detecting promotion campaigns on both the answer level and QA pair level.},

abstract = {Crowdsourcing has been a helpful mechanism to leverage human intelligence to acquire useful knowledge for well defined tasks. However, when aggregating the crowd knowledge based on the currently developed voting algorithms, it often results in common knowledge that may not be expected. In this paper, we consider the problem of collecting as specific as possible knowledge via crowdsourcing. With the help of using external knowledge base such as WordNet, we incorporate the semantic relations between the alternative answers into a probabilistic model to determine which answer is more specific. We formulate the probabilistic model considering both worker's ability and task's difficulty, and solve it by expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. Experimental results show that our approach achieved 35.88\% improvement over majority voting when more specific answers are expected.},

Existing approaches for learning blogospheres do not provide a comprehensive solution to dealing with these dynamics. In this paper, we propose a learning analytics approach for learning blogospheres unifying two complementary perspectives: (1) structural analysis of the blogosphere to identify learners' social capital; and (2) content analysis to capture dynamics in blog content over time. To support both types of analysis, social network analysis methods are applied as a fundamental approach to analyzing and visualizing knowledge sharing on learning blogospheres. We exemplify the learning analytics approach using two real-world learning blogospheres: the Mediabase --- a large blog collection for technology enhanced learning, and the European eTwinning Network --- a lifelong learning blogsphere. Results show that both analytics perspectives in combination advocate an advanced learning analytics approach to understanding and assessing learning processes in learning blogospheres.},

The goal is to cover and bring together the different approaches existing in managing and answering natural language questions of users on the Web. This includes methods, models and algorithms from automated question-answering, for question-answering forums mining, as well as for monitoring and management automation.Topics included in the call for papers were the following: question routing, question answeringquestion and answer recommendationquestion and need analysis, question modelingexpert finding, expertise categorization, expertise labellingdebate analysis, argument mining, argument schemesmoderating support and automationanimation fostering, targeted solicitation and notificationanswer generation, multiple and/or heterogeneous answer sourcesanswer detection and ranking, best answer identificationanswer building and answer improvingquestions and expert topic labellingrole detection (questioner, answerer, editor, etc.), user modellingsocial aspects of question answeringfact checking, cross-validation, supporting evidencespam or abuse prevention in questions and answersanswer personalizationchallenges, datasets, benchmarks for question-answering evaluationWe received seven submissions for the workshop. Each submission received at least three reviews by members of the program committee. On the basis of these reviews, we decided to accept six papers to be presented at the workshop and to be included in the conference proceedings.The paper by Burel et al. "Structural Normalisation Methods for Improving Best Answer Identification in Question Answering Communities" investigates the problem of how to identify the best answers in community-based Q/A portals. They propose to apply structural normalization techniques to feature-based best answer identification models.The paper by Jenders et al. "Which Answer is Best? Predicting Accepted Answers in MOOC Forums" deals with a similar topic, and investigates the identification of best answers in the context of MOOCS. They present a method that exploits historical data to find best answers for a question.In their paper "Using Semantics to Search Answers for Unanswered Questions in Q&amp;A Forums", Singh et al. present an approach that tackles the problem that in many Q/A community sites there are many unanswered questions. To mitigate this problem, they propose a system that finds answered questions that are similar to unanswered questions.Sandor et al. present an approach to the detection of user issues and request types in technical forum question posts. They propose a system that categorizes posts into these types using techniques from discourse analysis.In their paper "Enriching Topic Modelling with Users' histories for Improving Tag Prediction in Q&amp;A Systems", Loeckx et al. describe an approach to predict the tags for questions in social Q/A sites such as StackExchange. They propose a model that factors in the user context and show that this extension improves upon a purely textual content-based baseline.Finally, Shekarpour et al., in their paper "Question Answering on Linked Data: Challenges and Future Directions", present an overview of open and future challenges in the field of question answering from Linked Data.Presenters are encouraged to bring demos to the workshop to enhance oral discussions and presentations.Acknowledgment.

To overcome this problem, we propose SMURFEN: a Rule Sharing intrusion detection network, which provides a platform for IDS users to effectively share their customized detection knowledge in an IDS community. An automatic rule propagation mechanism is proposed based on a decentralized two-level optimization problem formulation. We evaluate our rule sharing system through simulations and compare our results to existing knowledge sharing methods such as random gossiping and fixed neighbors sharing schemes.},

abstract = {Learning cloud, which is built on the capabilities of ubiquitous computing and cloud computing, can provide a resource-rich and ubiquitous learning environment for learners in daily life. The goals of this study are: (1) Developing a Learning Cloud framework for learners by using mobile devices and desktop computers, which allows learners to study related activities anytime and anywhere, to prompt their knowledge sharing, and to keep in tough with social networks, and (2) Learning Cloud is a new learning platform, and its benefits to learners have not yet been identified. There are three major findings in this study: (1) The frequency of Internet use makes a positive impact on the cognitive and affective factors of cloud computing use, (2) the levels of cloud computing use positively affects the cognitive and affective factors of learning cloud adoption for lifelong learning.},

abstract = {Collaborative Question Answering (cQA) platforms are a very popular repository of crowd-generated knowledge. By formulating questions, users express needs that other members of the cQA community try to collaboratively satisfy. Poorly formulated questions are less likely to receive useful responses, thus hindering the overall knowledge generation process. Users are often asked to reformulate their needs, adding specific details, providing examples, or simply clarifying the context of their requests. Formulating a good question is a task that might require several interactions between the asker and other community members, thus delaying the actual answering and, possibly, decreasing the interest of the community in the issue. This paper contributes new insights to the study of cQA platforms by investigating the editing behaviour of users. We identify a number of editing actions, and provide a two-step approach for the automatic suggestion of the most likely editing actions to be performed for a newly created question. We evaluated our approach in the context of the Stack Overflow cQA , demonstrating how, for given types of editing actions, it is possible to provide accurate reformulation suggestions.},

abstract = {Community question answering (CQA) services provide platforms for increasing number of users to seek for help and exchange ideas in recent years. As a professional community, Quora is quite different from other traditional CQA websites, such as Baidu Zhidao and Yahoo! Answers. As users' social statuses play a more important role, besides just raising questions and finding a proper answer which the asker is satisfied with, people are inclined to have more discussions about the question, corresponding answers and related topics. Due to the spirit of wiki, people, especially some leading users work hard together to make the community a knowledge base of high quality, which in turn attracts more people to take part in this job. Thus, in this study, we focus on detecting leading users within a specific topic area of professional CQA services. A leading capacity model is utilized and three major criteria, which are authority, activity and influence, are taken into consideration. Then, an improved Borda count model is proposed to make a collective decision. Experimental results show effectiveness of the proposed method for finding leading users.},

abstract = {Workers in online crowd sourcing systems have different levels of expertise, trustworthiness, incentives and motivations. Therefore, recruiting sufficient number of well-suited workers is always a challenge. Existing methods usually recruit workers through open calls, friendships relations, matching their profiles with task requirements or recruiting teams of workers. But there are still challenges that need more investigations, mainly all existing recruitment methods are highly vulnerable to collaborating misbehaviour, i.e., Collusion. \%These groups are highly vulnerable to collusion attacks. In this paper, we propose a recruitment method which takes into account individual and social attributes of workers to find suitable workers. The method discovers indirect collaborations between workers to harness implicit teamwork knowledge in order to increase the quality of crowd sourcing tasks' outcome and in the same time prevent collusion attacks. The proposed method is implemented and tested using the simulated data, build based on a public data dump from Stack overflow. The evaluation results show the accuracy of the obtained results and superiority of our proposed method over the other related work.},

abstract = {Despite efforts to achieve a sustainable state of control over the management of global crises, disasters are occurring with greater frequency, intensity, and affecting many more people than ever before while the resources to deal with them do not grow apace. As we enter 2015, with continued concerns that mega-crises may become the new normal, we need to develop novel methods to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of our management of disasters. Software engineering as a discipline has long had an impact on society beyond its role in the development of software systems. In fact, software engineers have been described as the developers of prototypes for future knowledge workers; tools such as Github and Stack Overflow have demonstrated applications beyond the domain of software engineering. In this paper, we take the potential influence of software engineering one-step further and propose using the software service engineering paradigm as a new approach to managing disasters. Specifically, we show how the underlying principles of service-oriented architectures (SOA) can be applied to the coordination of disaster response operations. We describe key challenges in coordinating disaster response and discuss how an SOA approach can address those challenges.},

My dissertation research aims to reconcile the tension between the benefits and obstacles of intercultural brainstorming with pictures that are triggered by verbal ideas. Pictures provide extra stimulation without explicitly interrupting normal communication. Pictures may also mediate concepts in a language-independent manner, which may complement the still imperfect machine translation and make cross-lingual brainstorming feasible.},

abstract = {Automatically discovering cross-lingual links (CLs) between wikis can largely enrich the cross-lingual knowledge and facilitate knowledge sharing across different languages. In most existing approaches for cross-lingual knowledge linking, the seed CLs and the inner link structures are two important factors for finding new CLs. When there are insufficient seed CLs and inner links, discovering new CLs becomes a challenging problem. In this paper, we propose an approach that boosts cross-lingual knowledge linking by concept annotation. Given a small number of seed CLs and inner links, our approach first enriches the inner links in wikis by using concept annotation method, and then predicts new CLs with a regression-based learning model. These two steps mutually reinforce each other, and are executed iteratively to find as many CLs as possible. Experimental results on the English and Chinese Wikipedia data show that the concept annotation can effectively improve the quantity and quality of predicted CLs. With 50,000 seed CLs and 30\% of the original inner links in Wikipedia, our approach discovered 171,393 more CLs in four runs when using concept annotation.},

abstract = {Query term weighting is a fundamental task in information retrieval and most popular term weighting schemes are primarily based on statistical analysis of term occurrences within the document collection. In this work we study how term weighting may benefit from syntactic analysis of the corpus. Focusing on community question answering (CQA) sites, we take into account the syntactic function of the terms within CQA texts as an important factor affecting their relative importance for retrieval. We analyze a large log of web queries that landed on Yahoo Answers site, showing a strong deviation between the tendencies of different document words to appear in a landing (click-through) query given their syntactic function. To this end, we propose a novel term weighting method that makes use of the syntactic information available for each query term occurrence in the document, on top of term occurrence statistics. The relative importance of each feature is learned via a learning to rank algorithm that utilizes a click-through query log. We examine the new weighting scheme using manual evaluation based on editorial data and using automatic evaluation over the query log. Our experimental results show consistent improvement in retrieval when syntactic information is taken into account.},

Thus, they use different tools (such as search engines, issue tracking, or Q&amp;A sites) to collaborate and find code examples that meet their specific needs. However, such tools only support the traditional find-alter-embed approach of code examples while ignoring the origin and location of these sources. Such information can be very useful to assist software development tasks such as bug-fixing, teamwork, and knowledge transfer, through direct notification of critical changes made to the code example, or access to the original source including its discussions, issues, and bug reports. In this paper, we propose a new approach that consists of collecting meta information about a code example to automatically track critical changes to it and its origin and provide feedback to both developers and the online community.

However, FAQs are seldom used when specific knowledge or help is needed, thus raising the question, which factors influence FAQ acceptance in a community of practice (CoP). This paper proposes a conceptual model explaining conceptual artifacts' acceptance, based on the CoP and academic help-seeking approaches. Both are extensively covered by psychological and educational research literature, however their combination is not yet sufficiently investigated. A correlational study conducted in an academic software users' CoP, and involving structural equations modeling, validates the model, suggesting thus a research line that is worth further pursuing. For educational practice, the study suggests three ways of supporting knowledge sharing in CoPs, i.e. availability of technology-based conceptual artifacts, role definitions and division of labor, and purposeful communication in CoPs.},

In this study, we study how the virtual team members effectively share their knowledge through the network technology. Based on the Social Exchange Theory and a model of shared knowledge, we explore the critical factors and causal relationships among knowledge sharing on virtual team. The findings show that the total eight hypotheses have been confirmed and are valid. Thus, these findings could be good references for both academics and in practice.

abstract = {This study aims to understand the antecedents of knowledge sharing behavior amongst tenant firms in Science and Technology Parks (STPs) which has been highlighted as a key factor for the development of an epistemic culture of innovation in STPs. Components of a model of knowledge management leadership with a focus on knowledge sharing and innovative value creation in STPs are developed inspired by the work of Nonaka, Nahapiet and Ghoshal, Guns and others. Collection of data on various relevant measures is ongoing, covering technology firms and STPs in Singapore and other Asian countries. Besides outlining model components and hypotheses, tentative findings of qualitative interviews and survey work (with a focus on KM leadership in Singapore's STPs) are presented aimed at identifying strategic ingredients for the creation of intelligent STPs with a conducive culture of R&amp;D works and innovation as well as synergistic collaboration between tenant firms.},

abstract = {Ontology is a kind of concept model that describes system at the level of semantic knowledge. It aims to access domain knowledge in a general way and provides a common understanding of concepts in the domain so as to realize knowledge sharing and reuse among different application programs and organizations. The introduction of ontology in multimedia retrieval system can improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the retrieval system. In this paper we present, overview of Ontology. We explore the method of constructing concept ontology for sports video by identifying the concepts, concept hierarchy. We have adopted a semi-automatic construction method of multimedia ontology. We implement this, methodology to construct concept ontology for a cricket video.},

abstract = {In a software development environment where legacy software systems have been successfully deployed, there are tensions that deter the organization from moving towards software product line engineering (SPLE). An example is the effort required to develop a product line architecture versus time-to-market pressure or the lack of evidence to justify the benefits of SPLE. In this report we discuss the tensions that exist in Oc\'{e} Technologies. A reactive software reuse approach has not yielded the desired long-term benefits of reusability. A proactive approach requires knowledge exchange and coordination between software management and technical staff. We describe how such knowledge sharing can ease the tensions and facilitate a SPLE migration process.},
