abstract = {In this paper, we examine posting behavior on a large-scale online knowledge sharing platform, Stack Overflow, and investigate how that behavior changes as users gain experience and status. We use a trace ethnographic approach, analyzing both the sayings and doings of users and the numerical and categorical trace data produced by their activities on the platform. Through analysis of this data, as well as interviews with users at different levels of experience, we identify a pattern of behavior where users shift their focus over time from directly answering questions themselves to supporting others and maintaining the quality of knowledge on the platform thus playing a particular role as the knowledge community scales},

abstract = {Context: Developers usually seek solutions to addressing Security Vulnerabilities (SVs) on developer Question and Answer (Q&amp;A) websites. However, there is still little known about these SV-specific discussions on different Q&amp;A sites. Objective: We present a large-scale empirical study to understand developers’ SV discussions and how these discussions are being supported by Q&amp;A sites. Method: We use topic modeling to uncover the topics of 71,329 curated SV posts from two large Q&amp;A sites, namely Stack Overflow (SO) and Security StackExchange (SSE). We then analyze the popularity, difficulty, and level of expertise for each topic. We also perform a qualitative analysis to identify the types of solutions to SV-related questions. Results: We identify 13 main SV discussion topics. Many topics do not follow the distributions and trends in expert-based security sources, e.g., Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) and Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP). We also discover that SV discussions attract more experts to answer than many other domains, but some difficult SV topics (e.g., Vulnerability Scanning Tools) still receive quite limited support from experts. Moreover, we identify seven key types of answers given to SV questions, in which SO often provides code and instructions, while SSE usually gives experience-based advice and explanations. Conclusion: Our findings provide support for researchers and practitioners to effectively acquire, share and leverage SV knowledge on Q&amp;A sites.},

abstract = {GPUs have cemented their position in computer systems, not restricted to graphics but also extensively used for general-purpose computing. With this comes a rapidly expanding population of developers using GPUs for programming. However, programming with GPUs is notoriously difficult due to their unique architecture and constant evolution. A large number of developers have encountered problems of one kind or another, and many of them have turned to Q&amp;A sites for help. Unfortunately, there has been no prior work to comprehensively study the topics discussed and challenges encountered by developers in GPU programming. To fill this knowledge gap, we conduct a comprehensive study to understand the topics and challenges of GPU programming using Stack Overflow. We collect 25,269 relevant posts from Stack Overflow, propose a novel approach that combines automatic techniques and manual thematic analysis to extract topics, and build a taxonomy of topics with detailed discussions of the popularity, difficulty, and changing trends of these topics. In addition, we analyzed relevant posts through extensive manual efforts to understand the challenges of each topic and to summarize them for future research.},

In addition, we examine the visualization of directed acyclic graphs to analyze semantic relationships. The article further identifies issues with detecting certain semantic classes that are separated by the structure of directed acyclic graphs.},

abstract = {Questioning and answering (Q&amp;A) communities have become an important platform for online knowledge exchange. With a vast number of questions posted to elicit high-quality solutions as well as a large number of participants engaged in online knowledge sharing, a grand challenge for Q&amp;A communities is thus to effectively and efficiently identify and rank useful questions. The current approach to solving this problem is either through user voting or by community moderators. However, such manual processes are limited in terms of efficiency and scalability, especially for large Q&amp;A communities. Thus, automatically predicting the usefulness of questions has significant implications for the management of online Q&amp;A communities. To provide guidelines for assessing the quality of online questions, this research investigates and compares various classical machine learning and deep learning methods for predicting question usefulness. A dataset collected from a large Q&amp;A community was used to train and test those machine learning methods. The findings of this research provide important implications for both the research and practice of online Q&amp;A communities.},

abstract = {Background: Q&amp;A sites allow to study how users reference and request support on technical debt. To date only few studies, focusing on narrow aspects, investigate technical debt on Stack Overflow. Aims: We aim at gaining an in-depth understanding on the characteristics of technical debt questions on Stack Overflow. In addition, we assess if identification strategies based on machine learning can be used to automatically identify and classify technical debt questions. Method: We use automated and manual processes to identify technical debt questions on Stack Overflow. The final set of 415 questions is analyzed to study (i) technical debt types, (ii) question length, (iii) perceived urgency, (iv) sentiment, and (v) themes. Natural language processing and machine learning techniques are used to assess if questions can be identified and classified&nbsp;automatically. Results: Architecture debt is the most recurring debt type, followed by code and design debt. Most questions display mild urgency, with frequency of higher urgency steadily declining as urgency rises. Question length varies across debt types. Sentiment is mostly neutral. 29 recurrent themes emerge. Machine learning can be used to identify technical debt questions and binary urgency, but not debt types. Conclusions: Different patterns emerge from the analysis of technical debt questions on Stack Overflow. The results provide further insights on the phenomenon, and support the adoption of a more comprehensive strategy to identify technical debt questions.},

A three-step content analysis framework that investigates a sample of 8639 and 6126 contributions from Stack Overflow and r/Askprogramming respectively is presented. Preliminary results indicate that differences emerge in the scope of topics and the nature of responses the communities provide. While Stack Overflow is more task-specific, r/Askprogramming supports a greater sense of bonding and camaraderie among community members in addition to task-specific discussions. These results provide insights into the type of practices these communities support, which can be essential in considering how online communities that support learning activities should be designed.},

abstract = {Developers often look for solutions to programming problems in community Q&amp;A sites like Stack Overflow. Due to the crowdsourcing nature of these Q&amp;A sites, many user-provided answers are wrong, less optimal or out-of-date. Relying on community-curated quality indicators (e.g., accepted answer, answer vote) cannot reliably identify these answer problems. Such problematic answers are often criticized by other users. However, these critiques are not readily discoverable when reading the posts. In this paper, we consider the answers being criticized and their critique posts as controversial discussions in community Q&amp;A sites. To help developers notice such controversial discussions and make more informed choices of appropriate solutions, we design an automatic open information extraction approach for systematically discovering and summarizing the controversies in Stack Overflow and exploiting official API documentation to assist the understanding of the discovered controversies. We apply our approach to millions of java/android-tagged Stack overflow questions and answers and discover a large scale of controversial discussions in Stack Overflow. Our manual evaluation confirms that the extracted controversy information is of high accuracy. A user study with 18 developers demonstrates the usefulness of our generated controversy summaries in helping developers avoid the controversial answers and choose more appropriate solutions to programming questions.},

abstract = {Background: With the proliferation of crowd-sourced developer forums, Software developers are increasingly sharing more coding solutions to programming problems with others in forums. The decentralized nature of knowledge sharing on sites has raised the concern of sharing security vulnerable code, which then can be reused into mission critical software systems - making those systems vulnerable in the process. Collaborative editing has been introduced in forums like Stack Overflow to improve the quality of the shared contents. Aim: In this paper, we investigate whether code editing can mitigate shared vulnerable code examples by analyzing IoT code snippets and their revisions in three Stack Exchange sites: Stack Overflow, Arduino, and Raspberry Pi. Method:We analyze the vulnerabilities present in shared IoT C/C++ code snippets, as C/C++ is one of the most widely used languages in mission-critical devices and low-powered IoT devices. We further analyse the revisions made to these code snippets, and their effects. Results: We find several vulnerabilities such as CWE 788 - Access of Memory Location After End of Buffer , in 740 code snippets. However, we find the vast majority of posts are not revised, or revisions are not made to the code snippets themselves (598 out of 740). We also find that revisions are most likely to result in no change to the number of vulnerabilities in a code snippet rather than deteriorating or improving the snippet. Conclusions: We conclude that the current collaborative editing system in the forums may be insufficient to help mitigate vulnerabilities in the shared code.},

On one hand, moderation is of crucial importance in maintaining the content quality indispensable for the future sustainability of the site. On the other hand, details about the closing reason might frequently appear blurred to the user, which leads to debates and occasional negative behavior in answers or comments. With the aim of helping the users compose good quality questions, we introduce a set of classifiers for the categorization of Stack Overflow posts prior to their actual submission. Our binary classifier is capable of predicting whether a question will be closed after posting with an accuracy of 71.87\%. Additionally, in this study we propose the first multiclass classifier to estimate the exact reason of closing a question to an accuracy of 48.55\%. Both classifiers are based on Gated Recurrent Units and trained solely on the pre-submission textual information of Stack Overflow posts.},

abstract = {Stack Overflow is one of the most popular technical Q&amp;A sites used by software developers. Seeking help from Stack Overflow has become an essential part of software developers’ daily work for solving programming-related questions. Although the Stack Overflow community has provided quality assurance guidelines to help users write better questions, we observed that a significant number of questions submitted to Stack Overflow are of low quality. In this paper, we introduce a new web-based tool, Code2Que, which can help developers in writing higher quality questions for a given code snippet. Code2Que consists of two main stages: offline learning and online recommendation. In the offline learning phase, we first collect a set of good quality ⟨code snippet, question⟩ pairs as training samples. We then train our model on these training samples via a deep sequence-to-sequence approach, enhanced with an attention mechanism, a copy mechanism and a coverage mechanism. In the online recommendation phase, for a given code snippet, we use the offline trained model to generate question titles to assist less experienced developers in writing questions more effectively. To evaluate Code2Que, we first sampled 50 low quality ⟨code snippet, question⟩ pairs from the Python and Java datasets on Stack Overflow. Then we conducted a user study to evaluate the question titles generated by our approach as compared to human-written ones using three metrics: Clearness, Fitness and Willingness to Respond. Our experimental results show that for a large number of low-quality questions in Stack Overflow, Code2Que can improve the question titles in terms of Clearness, Fitness and Willingness measures.},

We elaborated a model based on the relational view of interorganizational relations, complemented by the theory of boundary objects. We provide an empirical validation of this model from a sample of IT managers in state and local governments in Mexico. We found that public-private ITO can generate public value thanks to a high quality of the information system produced in related projects. Information system quality is supported by effective knowledge sharing between project partners. The quality of knowledge sharing is expressed by the quality of the contract and other artifacts that facilitate building shared understanding and by conflict resolution processes developed during the partnership. The quality of knowledge sharing depends on the level of two trust-related dimensions: benevolence and competence between outsourcing partners. In our model, we relate in a novel way trust, knowledge sharing, the quality of IT services produced and public value in the context of public-private ITO. We also propose an original formulation and validation of knowledge sharing dimensions, looking at the importance of specific knowledge interfaces to bridge semantic and pragmatic boundaries in public-private ITO.},

abstract = {Fixing crashes is challenging, and developers often discuss their encountered crashes and refer to similar crashes and solutions on online Q&amp;A forums (e.g., Stack Overflow). However, a crash often involves very complex contexts, which includes different contextual elements, e.g., purposes, environments, code, and crash traces. Existing crash solution recommendation or general solution 
recommendation techniques only use an incomplete context or treat the entire context as pure texts to search relevant solutions for a given crash, resulting in inaccurate recommendation results. In this work, we propose a novel crash solution knowledge graph (KG) to summarize the complete crash context and its solution with a graph-structured representation. To construct the crash solution KG automatically, we propose to leverage prompt learning to construct the KG from SO threads with a small set of labeled data. Based on the constructed KG, we further propose a novel KG-based crash solution recommendation technique KG4CraSolver, which precisely finds the relevant SO thread for an encountered crash by finely analyzing and matching the complete crash context based on the crash 
solution KG. The evaluation results show that the constructed KG is of high quality and KG4CraSolver outperforms baselines in terms of all metrics (e.g., 13.4\%-113.4\% MRR improvements). Moreover, we perform a user study and find that KG4CraSolver helps participants find crash solutions 34.4\% faster and 63.3\% more accurately.},

abstract = {Programmers often use Q&amp;A sites (e.g., Stack Overflow) to understand a root cause of program bugs. Runtime exceptions is one of such important class of bugs that is actively discussed on Stack Overflow. However, it may be difficult for beginner programmers to come up with appropriate keywords for search. Moreover, they need to switch their attentions between IDE and browser, and it is time-consuming. To overcome these difficulties, we proposed a method, "Q&amp;A MAESTRO", to find suitable Q&amp;A posts automatically for Java runtime exception by utilizing structure information of codes described in programming Q&amp;A website.

abstract = {Online question answering (Q&amp;A) forums like Stack Overflow have been playing an increasingly important role in supporting the daily tasks of developers. Stack Overflow can be considered as a meeting point of experienced developers and those who are looking for a solution for a specific problem. Since anyone with any background and experience level can ask and respond to questions, the community tries to use different solutions to maintain quality, such as closing and deleting inappropriate posts. As over 8,000 posts arrive on Stack Overflow every day, the effective automatic filtering of them is essential. In this paper, we present a novel approach for classifying questions based exclusively on their linguistic and semantic features using deep learning method. Our binary classifier relying on the textual properties of posts can predict whether the question is to be closed with an accuracy of 74\% similar to the results of previous metrics-based models. In accordance with our findings we conclude that by combining deep learning and natural language processing methods, the maintenance of quality at Q&amp;A forums could be supported using only the raw text of posts.},

abstract = {Various data mining tasks have been proposed to study Community Question Answering (CQA) platforms like Stack Overflow. The relatedness between some of these tasks provides useful learning signals to each other via Multi-Task Learning (MTL). However, due to the high heterogeneity of these tasks, few existing works manage to jointly solve them in a unified framework. To tackle this challenge, we develop a multi-relational graph based MTL model called Heterogeneous Multi-Task Graph Isomorphism Network (HMTGIN) which efficiently solves heterogeneous CQA tasks. In each training forward pass, HMTGIN embeds the input CQA forum graph by an extension of Graph Isomorphism Network and skip connections. The embeddings are then shared across all task-specific output layers to compute respective losses. Moreover, two cross-task constraints based on the domain knowledge about tasks' relationships are used to regularize the joint learning. In the evaluation, the embeddings are shared among different task-specific output layers to make corresponding predictions. To the best of our knowledge, HMTGIN is the first MTL model capable of tackling CQA tasks from the aspect of multi-relational graphs. To evaluate HMTGIN's effectiveness, we build a novel large-scale multi-relational graph CQA dataset with over two million nodes from Stack Overflow. Extensive experiments show that: (1) HMTGIN is superior to all baselines on five tasks; (2) The proposed MTL strategy and cross-task constraints have substantial advantages.},

abstract = {Community question answering (CQA) has become an essential service of promoting knowledge sharing in social platforms. To make question answering more efficient, several expert recommendation methods for CQA have been proposed, but most of them focus on the similarity matching between user interest and question content while ignoring the temporal dynamics of user interest, whose changes may decrease the quality of recommendation results. In this paper, a long and short term-based expert recommendation model (LSTERM) via attention mechanism-based CNN and Bi-GRU, which considers not only user interest but also user expertise, is proposed. The model can learn the embedded user/question feature representation from various content information by using attention mechanism-based CNN and then track the change of user interest and expertise over time by using Bi-GRU. Experiment results on real data demonstrate that with temporal dynamics, the recommendation accuracy is substantially improved compared with other state-of-the-art methods.},

abstract = {Community Question Answering (CQA) sites such as Yahoo! Answers and Stack Overflow, are knowledge sharing platforms that allow users to post questions and answer questions asked by other users. One of the characteristics of CQA is a time lag between questions and answers. To reduce the time lag between them, various approaches have been suggested such as question retrieval and question routing. In this paper we propose a weighted question retrieval model that uses question titles, question descriptions, and their relationship for calculating question similarity in large-scale CQA archives. From the experiment our weighted question retrieval model outperforms the baseline that uses only question titles, and we found that exploiting the question descriptions increases the ranks of the relevant questions while reducing the recalls of them as compared with the baseline.},

However, it is difficult to determine which APIs are discussed in those code snippets because they often suffer from declaration ambiguities and missing external references. In this paper, we introduce COSTER, a context-sensitive type solver that can determine the fully qualified names (FQNs) of API elements in those code snippets. The tool uses three different similarity measures to rank potential FQNs of a query API element. Results from our quantitative evaluation and user study demonstrate that the proposed tool can not only recommend FQNs of API elements with great accuracy but can also help developers to reuse online code snippets by suggesting the required import statements.Website: https://khaledkucse.github.io/COSTER/Demo Video: https://youtu.be/oDZtw9MzUWM},

abstract = {Stack Overflow is a popular platform for developers to seek solutions to programming-related problems. However, prior studies identified that developers may suffer from the redundant, useless, and incomplete information retrieved by the Stack Overflow search engine. To help developers better utilize the Stack Overflow knowledge, researchers proposed tools to summarize answers to a Stack Overflow question. However, existing tools use hand-craft features to assess the usefulness of each answer sentence and fail to remove semantically redundant information in the result. Besides, existing tools only focus on a certain programming language and cannot retrieve up-to-date new posted knowledge from Stack Overflow. In this paper, we propose TechSumBot, an automatic answer summary generation tool for a technical problem. Given a question, TechSumBot first retrieves answers using the Stack Overflow search engine, then TechSumBot 1) ranks each answers sentence based on the sentence's usefulness, 2) estimates the centrality of each sentence to all candidates, and 3) removes the semantic redundant information. Finally, TechSumBot returns the top 5 ranked answer sentences as the answer summary. We implement TechSumBot in the form of a search engine website. To evaluate TechSumBot in both automatic and manual manners, we construct the first Stack Overflow multi-answer summarization benchmark and design a manual evaluation study to assess the effectiveness of TechSumBot and state-of-the-art baselines from the NLP and SE domain. Both results indicate that the summaries generated by TechSumBot are more diverse, useful, and similar to the ground truth summaries.Tool Link: www.techsumbot.comVideo Link: https://youtube.coni/watch7v-ozuJOp_vILMReplication Package: https://github.com/TechSumBot/TechSumBot},

Questionnaires were carried out to collect data from 565 participants. Descriptive statistics, correlation coefficients, and multiple linear regression were applied for the statistical analysis. In addition, t-tests were employed to compare the difference between generation Y and generation Z employees in relation to perceived organizational justice, innovative work behavior, and knowledge sharing. The results indicate that procedural justice, distributive justice, and spatial justice in the perceived organizational justice impacted directly on innovative work behavior at a significant level, while interactional justice impacted innovative work behavior through knowledge sharing as a mediator. However, procedural justice had no effect on innovative work behavior. Furthermore, generation Z's perceived organizational justice was higher than that of generation Y. For generation Z, knowledge sharing was higher than that of Generation Y at a significant level. On the other hand, generation Y's innovative working behavior was higher than that of generation Z. The study's findings can be used as guidance to improve workers' innovative work behavior in the organization.},

abstract = {Stack Overflow is one of the largest and most popular question-answering (Q&amp;A) websites. It accumulates millions of programming related questions and answers to support the developers in software development. Unfortunately, a large number of questions are not answered at all, which might hurt the quality or purpose of this community-oriented knowledge base. Up to 29\% of Stack Overflow questions do not have any answers. There have been existing attempts in detecting the unanswered questions. Unfortunately, they primarily rely on the question attributes (e.g., score, view count) that are not available during the submission of a question. Detection of the potentially unanswered questions in advance during question submission could help one improve the question and thus receive the answers in time. In this paper, we compare unanswered and answered questions quantitatively and qualitatively by analyzing a total of 4.8 million questions from Stack Overflow. We find that topics discussed in the question, the experience of the question submitter, and readability of question texts could often determine whether a question would be answered or not. Our qualitative study also reveals several other non-trivial factors that not only explain (partially) why the questions remain unanswered but also guide the novice users to improve their questions. We develop four machine learning models to predict the unanswered questions during their submission. According to the experiments, our models predict the unanswered questions with a maximum of about 79\% accuracy and significantly outperform the state-of-the-art prediction models.},

abstract = {Stack Overflow (SO) platform has a huge dataset of questions and answers driven by interactions between users. But the count of unanswered questions is continuously rising, which is observed in various similar community Question \&amp; Answering platforms (Q&amp;A) such as Yahoo, Quora and so on. To address this issue, these communities have explored clustering mechanisms to answer unanswered questions using other answered questions in the same cluster, which could also improve the response time for new questions. It is here, we propose SOCluster, an approach and a tool to cluster SO questions using a graph-based clustering approach. We selected four datasets of 10k, 20k, 30k \&amp; 40k SO questions without code-snippets or images involved, and performed clustering on them. We have done a preliminary evaluation of our tool by analyzing the resultant clusters using the commonly used metrics of Silhouette coefficient, Calinkski-Harabasz Index, \&amp; Davies-Bouldin Index. We performed clustering for 8 different threshold similarity values and analyzed the intriguing trends reflected by the output clusters through the three evaluation metrics. At 90\% threshold similarity, it shows the best improvement for the three evaluation metrics on all four datasets. We further manually assessed the content in the clusters to confirm the similarity of elements in clusters. This revealed clusters to correspond to topics such as mouse over effect, speed optimisation, how to perform ‘some’ action in JavaScript, and so on. The source code and tool are available for download on Github at: https://github.com/rishalab/SOCluster, and the demo can be found here: https://youtu.be/Ewm-M_rg_x8.},

abstract = {A large amount of rich data available in today’s world encounters a lot of opportunities to analyze the data and identify some valuable patterns from them. However, dealing with such data requires automated frameworks and knowledge of programming languages. The most common and widely used programming languages among developers are Java and Python, as evident from the queries and issues posted on Stack Overflow and GitHub. Despite the popularity of both Java and Python, the challenges in transitioning from one technology to another technology are hard for individuals and industries. In this paper, we aim to investigate similarities in the challenges faced by developers while dealing with both programming languages. To achieve this goal, we formulated two research questions (RQs) for understanding the topics and issues asked and faced by developers. We have also identified the temporal trend of asking new questions on Stack Overflow for Java and Python programming languages (PLs). Our results revealed the changing trend, from 2015 onwards, from Java to Python and inclined towards Python from the number of new posts on Stack Overflow. We analyzed 18,892 Stack Overflow questions related to Java and Python PLs and 42,674 issues from 22 different GitHub repositories, 11 for each PL. Our results indicate that questions asked on Stack Overflow are co-related to issues posted by developers on GitHub during real-time development for a respective PL.},

This study analyzed JavaScript online code clones between Stack Overflow and GitHub repositories. We first developed a JavaScript code corpus to search online clones. The clone search results reported 12,579 online clones between 276,547 non-trivial syntactically validated Stack Overflow snippets and 292 GitHub repositories. We manually classified the top 10\% (1257) pairs of clones in seven online clone patterns. We observed that around 70\% of JavaScript snippets in Stack Overflow posts are copied from GitHub repositories or from other external sources. Moreover, only 30.59\% of JavaScript Snippets in Stack Overflow accepted answers could be considered as reusable snippets.},

abstract = {Developers constantly learn new APIs, but often lack necessary information from documentation, resorting instead to popular question-and-answer platforms such as Stack Overflow. In this paper, we investigate how to use recent machine-learning-based knowledge extraction techniques to automatically identify pairs of comparable API methods and the sentences describing the comparison from Stack Overflow answers. We first built a prototype that can be stocked with a dataset of comparable API methods and provides tool-tips to users in search results and in API documentation. We conducted a user study with this tool based on a dataset of TensorFlow comparable API methods spanning 198 hand-annotated facts from Stack Overflow posts. This study confirmed that providing comparable API methods can be useful for helping developers understand the design space of APIs: developers using our tool were significantly more aware of the comparable API methods and better understood the differences between them. We then created SOREL, an comparable API methods knowledge extraction tool trained on our hand-annotated corpus, which achieves a 71\% precision and 55\% recall at discovering our manually extracted facts and discovers 433 pairs of comparable API methods from thousands of unseen Stack Overflow posts. This work highlights the merit of jointly studying programming assistance tools and constructing machine learning techniques to power them.},

abstract = {Context: Software development is a knowledge-intensive activity, and its success in an organization relies deeply on knowledge sharing. Knowledge management challenges are often increased in agile environments, which involve a lot of tacit knowledge, commonly acquired through experiences and hard to be made explicit. Therefore, knowledge sharing among practitioners is crucial. However, identifying suitable experts to share specific knowledge is not trivial. It involves not only discovering the individuals with the desired knowledge but also considering other factors that may improve the expert responsiveness, such as social connections and availability. Objective: Considering the important role experts play in knowledge sharing, we decided to investigate approaches that help identify experts that can share knowledge in software development. Our goal is to provide a panorama of the existing approaches and shine a light on research opportunities. Method: We carried out a systematic literature mapping and analyzed 17 publications. Results: The results show that most approaches have relied on code repositories as a source of evidence for identifying experts and, consequently, focus on supporting developers and aiding in the codification activity. Additionally, expert identification has been mostly automated, and factors beyond possessing the desired knowledge have often been disregarded. Conclusion: Although there are several expert identification approaches, there has been a lack of concern with factors that influence reaching the most suitable expert for a specific situation (e.g., considering the characteristics of the person seeking knowledge). Moreover, there is a need for deeper reflection on how to better explore different artifacts as sources of expert evidence and how to combine them to improve expert identification.},

abstract = {In software development process, developers often seek solutions to the technical problems they encounter by searching relevant questions on Q&amp;A sites. When developers fail to find solutions on Q&amp;A sites in their native language (e.g., Chinese), they could translate their query and search on the Q&amp;A sites in another language (e.g., English). However, developers who are non-native English speakers often are not comfortable to ask or search questions in English, as they do not know the proper translation of the Chinese technical words into the English technical words. Furthermore, the process of manually formulating cross-language queries and determining the weight of query words is a tedious and time-consuming process.For the purpose of helping Chinese developers take advantage of the rich knowledge base of the English version of Stack Overflow and simplify the retrieval process, we propose an automated cross-language relevant question retrieval (CLRQR) system to retrieve relevant English questions on Stack Overflow for a given Chinese question. Our CLRQR system first extracts essential information (both Chinese and English) from the title and description of the input Chinese question, then performs domain-specific translation of the essential Chinese information into English, and formulates a query with highest-scored English words for retrieving relevant questions in a repository of 684,599 Java questions in English from Stack Overflow. To evaluate the performance of our proposed approach, we also propose four online retrieval approaches as baselines. We randomly select 80 Java questions in SegmentFault and V2EX (two Chinese Q&amp;A websites for computer programming) as the query Chinese questions. Each approach returns top-10 most relevant questions for a given Chinese question. We invite 5 users to evaluate the relevance of the retrieved English questions. The experiment results show that CLRQR system outperforms the four baseline approaches, and the statistical tests show the improvements are significant.},

abstract = {Knowledge sharing platforms like Quora have millions and billions of questions. With such a vast number of questions, there will be a lot of duplicates in it. Duplicate questions in these sites are normal, especially with the increasing number of questions asked. These redundant queries reduce efficiency and create repetitive data on the data server. Because these questions have the same answers, the user has to write the same content for each of these questions, which is a waste of time. Dealing with this issue would be significant for helping community question answering websites to sort out this problem and deduplicate their database. In this paper, we augment the Siamese-LSTM in two ways to achieve better results than the previous works. First, we augment basic Siamese-LSTM with a dense-layer (Model-1) to observe the improvement. In the second part, Siamese-LSTM is augmented with the machine learning classifier (Model-2). In both scenarios, we observed the improved results when we include the Hand-Engineered features. The proposed model (Model-1) achieves the highest accuracy of 89.11\%.},

abstract = {Today, coding skills are among the most required competencies worldwide, often also for non-computer scientists. Because of this trend, community contribution-based, question-and-answer (Q&amp;A) platforms became prominent for finding the proper solution to all programming issues. Stack Overflow has been the most popular platform for technical-related questions for years. Still, recently, some programming-related subreddits of Reddit have become a standing stone for questions and discussions. This work investigates the developers’ behavior and community formation around the twenty most popular programming languages. We examined two consecutive years of programming-related questions from Stack Overflow and Reddit, performing a longitudinal study on users’ posting activity and their high-order interaction patterns abstracted via hypergraphs. Our analysis highlighted crucial differences in how these Q&amp;A platforms are utilized by their users. In line with previous literature, it emphasized the constant decline of Stack Overflow in favor of more community-friendly platforms, such as Reddit, which has been growing rapidly lately.},

abstract = {Industrial recommender systems usually need to serve multiple scenarios at the same time. In practice, there are various heterogeneous scenarios, since users frequently engage in scenarios with varying intentions and the items within each scenario typically belong to diverse categories. Existing works of multi-scenario recommendation mainly focus on modeling homogeneous scenarios which have similar data distributions. They equally transfer knowledge to each scenario without considering the diversity of heterogeneous scenarios. In this paper, we argue that the heterogeneity in multi-scenario recommendations is a key problem that needs to be solved. To this end, we propose an industrial framework named Scenario-Aware Model-Agnostic Meta Distillation (SAMD) for the multi-scenario recommendation. SAMD aims to provide scenario-aware and model-agnostic knowledge sharing across heterogeneous scenarios by modeling scenarios' relationship and conducting heterogeneous knowledge distillation. Specifically, SAMD first measures the comprehensive representation of each scenario and then proposes a novel meta distillation paradigm to conduct scenario-aware knowledge sharing. The meta network first establishes the potential scenarios' relationships and generates the strategies of knowledge sharing for each scenario. Then the heterogeneous knowledge distillation utilizes scenario-aware strategies to share knowledge across heterogeneous scenarios through intermediate features distillation without the restriction of the model architecture. In this way, SAMD shares knowledge across heterogeneous scenarios in a scenario-aware and model-agnostic manner, which addresses the problem of heterogeneity. Compared with other state-of-the-art methods, extensive offline experiments, and online A/B testing demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed SAMD framework, especially in heterogeneous scenarios.},

abstract = {Community-question-answering systems, such as Stack Overflow, provide a platform for various communities to ask questions, discuss topics, and find knowledge. Especially software developers are heavily relying on such systems to identify solutions for their problems. While the content of community-question-answering systems may be less scientific, it usually represents practical knowledge from various perspectives and backgrounds. Thus, analyzing this content can be valuable for the scientific community to understand previous and current (i.e., open questions) needs of practitioners. In this paper, we report a systematic analysis of two websites that comprise communities with a focus on software development: Stack Exchange and Quora. We extract questions, answers, comments, and discussions on software product lines in general and feature modeling in particular. The results provide a historical perspective, an overview on commonly addressed scopes, and a classification of discussed topics and problems. Moreover, our findings are interesting to understand the practical impact of software-product-line techniques outside of well-analyzed case studies, to support lectures by identifying regularly asked questions, and to scope tool development based on reported technical problems.},

abstract = {Informal documentation contained in resources such as Q&amp;A websites (e.g., Stack Overflow) is a precious resource for developers, who can find there examples on how to use certain APIs, as well as opinions about pros and cons of such APIs. Automatically identifying and classifying such opinions can alleviate developers' burden in performing manual searches, and can be used to recommend APIs that are good from some points of view (e.g., performance), or highlight those less ideal from other perspectives (e.g., compatibility). We propose POME (Pattern-based Opinion MinEr), an approach that leverages natural language parsing and pattern-matching to classify Stack Overflow sentences referring to APIs according to seven aspects (e.g., performance, usability), and to determine their polarity (positive vs negative). The patterns have been inferred by manually analyzing 4,346 sentences from Stack Overflow linked to a total of 30 APIs. We evaluated POME by (i) comparing the pattern-matching approach with machine learners leveraging the patterns themselves as well as n-grams extracted from Stack Overflow posts; (ii) assessing the ability of POME to detect the polarity of sentences, as compared to sentiment-analysis tools; (iii) comparing POME with the state-of-the-art Stack Overflow opinion mining approach, Opiner, through a study involving 24 human evaluators. Our study shows that POME exhibits a higher precision than a state-of-the-art technique (Opiner), in terms of both opinion aspect identification and polarity assessment.},

abstract = {API documentation, technical blogs and programming Q&amp;A sites contain a large amount of partial code that can be reused in programming tasks. However, due to unresolved simple names and last-mile syntax errors, such partial code is frequently not compilable. To facilitate partial code reuse, we develop PCR-Chain for resolving FQNs and fixing last-mile syntax errors in partial code based on a giant pre-trained code model (e.g., Copilot). Methodologically, PCR-Chain is backed up by the underlying global-level prompt architecture (which combines three design ideas: hierarchical task breakdown, prompt composition including sequential and conditional structures, and a mix of prompt-based AI and non-AI units) and the local-level prompt design. Technically, we propose PCR-Chain, which employs in-context learning rather than supervised fine-tuning with gradient updates on downstream task data. This approach enables the frozen, giant pre-trained code model to learn the desired behavior for a specific task through behavior-describing prompts and imitate it to complete the task. Experimental results show that PCR-Chain automatically resolves the FQNs and fixes last-mile syntax errors in 50 partial code samples collected from Stack Overflow with high success rates, without requiring any program analysis. The correct execution of the unit, module, and PCR-Chain demonstrates the effectiveness of the prompt design, prompt composition, and prompt architecture.Website:https://github.com/SE-qinghuang/PCR-ChainDemo Video: https://youtu.be/6HGRNdc2_JE},

abstract = {Security is an increasing concern in software development. Developer Question and Answer (Q&amp;A) websites provide a large amount of security discussion. Existing studies have used human-defined rules to mine security discussions, but these works still miss many posts, which may lead to an incomplete analysis of the security practices reported on Q&amp;A websites. Traditional supervised Machine Learning methods can automate the mining process; however, the required negative (non-security) class is too expensive to obtain. We propose a novel learning framework, PUMiner, to automatically mine security posts from Q&amp;A websites. PUMiner builds a context-aware embedding model to extract features of the posts, and then develops a two-stage PU model to identify security content using the labelled Positive and Un-labelled posts. We evaluate PUMiner on more than 17.2 million posts on Stack Overflow and 52,611 posts on Security StackExchange. We show that PUMiner is effective with the validation performance of at least 0.85 across all model configurations. Moreover, Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) of PUMiner is 0.906, 0.534 and 0.084 points higher than one-class SVM, positive-similarity filtering, and one-stage PU models on unseen testing posts, respectively. PUMiner also performs well with an MCC of 0.745 for scenarios where string matching totally fails. Even when the ratio of the labelled positive posts to the un-labelled ones is only 1:100, PUMiner still achieves a strong MCC of 0.65, which is 160\% better than fully-supervised learning. Using PUMiner, we provide the largest and up-to-date security content on Q&amp;A websites for practitioners and researchers.},

abstract = {Software Q&amp;A sites (like Stack Overflow) play an essential role in developers’ day-to-day work for problem-solving. Although search engines (like Google) are widely used to obtain a list of relevant posts for technical problems, we observed that the redundant relevant posts and sheer amount of information barriers developers to digest and identify the useful answers. In this paper, we propose a tool AnswerBot which enables to automatically generate an answer summary for a technical problem. AnswerBot consists of three main stages, (1) relevant question retrieval, (2) useful answer paragraph selection, (3) diverse answer summary generation. We implement it in the form of a search engine website. To evaluate AnswerBot, we first build a repository includes a large number of Java questions and their corresponding answers from Stack Overflow. Then, we conduct a user study that evaluates the answer summary generated by AnswerBot and two baselines (based on Google and Stack Overflow search engine) for 100 queries. The results show that the answer summaries generated by AnswerBot are more relevant, useful, and diverse. Moreover, we also substantially improved the efficiency of AnswerBot (from 309 to 8 seconds per query).},

abstract = {Energy efficiency has become an important consideration in deep learning systems. However, it remains a largely under-emphasized aspect during the development. Despite the emergence of energy-efficient deep learning patterns, their adoption remains a challenge due to limited awareness. To address this gap, we present DENT (Deep Learning Energy Pattern Tagger, a Chrome extension used to add "energy pattern tags" to the deep learning related questions from Stack Overflow. The idea of DENT is to hint to the developers about the possible energy-saving opportunities associated with the Stack Overflow post through energy pattern labels. We hope this will increase awareness about energy patterns in deep learning and improve their adoption. A preliminary evaluation of DENT achieved an average precision of 0.74, recall of 0.66, and an F1-score of 0.65 with an accuracy of 66\%.

abstract = {Background: Software ecosystems are becoming increasingly complex and large. Therefore, discovering and selecting the right libraries and frameworks for use in a project is becoming a challenging task. Existing commercial services that support this task rely on annual surveys with developers to provide a landscape of the most popular technologies in a given ecosystem. Aims: In this paper, we outline a semi-automated technique for this purpose, which we call TechSpaces. Method: Our proposal relies on community detection and well-known NLP algorithms to automatically extract groups of related technologies, using as primary data source tags associated with Stack Overflow questions. Results: We describe the first results of using our technique to identify popular and inter-related technologies in five programming language ecosystems. Evaluation: We compare our technique against two other tools in the literature. Conclusions: The proposed technique shows potential to assist IT professionals in taking technical decisions supported by crowd knowledge. However, further improvements are needed to make it a viable choice. For instance, we envision the usage of other data sources (e.g., GitHub and Wikipedia) can contribute to improve the accuracy and expressiveness of our graph representations.},

abstract = {To solve programming issues, developers commonly search on Stack Overflow to seek potential solutions. However, there is a gap between the knowledge developers are interested in and the knowledge they are able to retrieve using search engines. To help developers efficiently retrieve relevant knowledge on Stack Overflow, prior studies proposed several techniques to reformulate queries and generate summarized answers. However, few studies performed a large-scale analysis using real-world search logs. In this paper, we characterize how developers search on Stack Overflow using such logs. By doing so, we identify the challenges developers face when searching on Stack Overflow and seek opportunities for the platform and researchers to help developers efficiently retrieve knowledge. To characterize search activities on Stack Overflow, we use search log data based on requests to Stack Overflow's web servers. We find that the most common search activity is reformulating the immediately preceding queries. Related work looked into query reformulations when using generic search engines and found 13 types of query reformulation strategies. Compared to their results, we observe that 71.78\% of the reformulations can be fitted into those reformulation strategies. In terms of how queries are structured, 17.41\% of the search sessions only search for fragments of source code artifacts (e.g., class and method names) without specifying the names of programming languages, libraries, or frameworks. Based on our findings, we provide actionable suggestions for Stack Overflow moderators and outline directions for future research. For example, we encourage Stack Overflow to set up a database that includes the relations between all computer programming terminologies shared on Stack Overflow, e.g., method name, data structure name, design pattern, and IDE name. By doing so, Stack Overflow could improve the performance of search engines by considering related programming terminologies at different levels of granularity.},

abstract = {Question and Answer (Q&amp;A) sites help developers dealing with the increasing complexity of software systems and third-party components by providing a platform for exchanging knowledge about programming topics. A shortcoming of Q&amp;A sites is that they provide no indication on when an answer is to be expected. Such an indication would help, for example, the developers who posed the questions in managing their time. We try to fill this gap by investigating whether and how answering time for a question posed on Stack Overflow, a prominent example of Q&amp;A websites, can be predicted considering its tags. To this aim, we first determine the types of answers to be considered valid answers to the question, after which the answering time was predicted based on similarity of the set of tags. Our results show that the classification is correct in 30\%-35\% of the cases.},

Our findings reveal that although co-editing questions is perceived as a positive and effective approach for improving questions' answerability and shaping norms in the online community, effective moderation mechanisms need to be designed to improve transparency and communication about co-editing behavior and to address possible tensions as a result of co-editing wars.},

abstract = {Online Q&amp;A fora such as Stack Overflow assist developers to solve their faced coding problems. Despite the advantages, Stack Overflow has the potential to provide insecure code snippets that, if reused, can compromise the security of the entire software. We present Dicos, an accurate approach by examining the change history of Stack Overflow posts for discovering insecure code snippets. When a security issue was detected in a post, the insecure code is fixed to be safe through user discussions, leaving a change history. Inspired by this process, Dicos first extracts the change history from the Stack Overflow post, and then analyzes the history whether it contains security patches, by utilizing pre-selected features that can effectively identify security patches. Finally, when such changes are detected, Dicos determines that the code snippet before applying the security patch is insecure. To evaluate Dicos, we collected 1,958,283 Stack Overflow posts tagged with C, C++, and Android. When we applied Dicos on the collected posts, Dicos discovered 12,458 insecure posts (i.e., 14,719 insecure code snippets) from the collected posts with 91\% precision and 93\% recall. We further confirmed that the latest versions of 151 out of 2,000 popular C/C++ open-source software contain at least one insecure code snippet taken from Stack Overflow, being discovered by Dicos. Our proposed approach, Dicos, can contribute to preventing further propagation of insecure codes and thus creating a safe code reuse environment.},

We present our algorithm in a two-fold structure: First, we use Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) to uncover the users’ engagement states inside a CQA. Second, we apply a Reinforcement Learning Model (RL) to recommend users the questions that match better with their engagement mood and thus help them get into a better engagement state (the one with the least churning probability). Experiments on a large-scale offline dataset from Stack Overflow show a meaningful reduction in the churning probability of the users who comply with HRCR’s question recommendations.},

The knowledge sharing between these two types of open source communities can be very beneficial to both of them. However, it is a great challenge to automate this process. Current studies mainly focus on knowledge acquisition in one type of community, and few of them have tackle this problem efficiently. In this paper we take Android Issue Tracker and Stack Overflow as a case to study automatic knowledge sharing between them. We propose an automatic approach by integrating semantic similarity with temporal locality between Android issues and Stack Overdo posts to reveal the potential associations between them. Our approach exploits the rich semantics in fine-grained information of issues and posts for associations building, and explores the temporal correlations between issues and posts in-depth for associations ranking. Extensive experiments show that the precision of our approach reaches 54.82\% for top 10 recommendations when recommending Stack Overflow posts to Android issues, and 66.83\%in reverse. This is significantly higher than the state-of-the-art method.},

abstract = {A growing number of software-intensive systems are being accused of violating or ignoring human values (e.g., privacy, inclusion, and social responsibility), and this poses great difficulties to individuals and society. Such violations often occur due to the solutions employed and decisions made by developers of such systems that are misaligned with user values. Stack Overflow is the most popular Q&amp;A website among developers to share their issues, solutions (e.g., code snippets), and decisions during software development. We conducted an exploratory study to investigate the occurrence of human values violations in Stack Overflow posts. As comments under posts are often used to point out the possible issues and weaknesses of the posts, we analyzed 2,000 Stack Overflow comments and their corresponding posts (1,980 unique questions or answers) to identify the types of human values violations and the reactions of Stack Overflow users to such violations. Our study finds that 315 out of 2,000 comments contain concerns indicating their associated posts (313 unique posts) violate human values. Leveraging Schwartz’s theory of basic human values as the most widely used values model, we show that hedonism and benevolence are the most violated value categories. We also find the reaction of Stack Overflow commenters to perceived human values violations is very quick, yet the majority of posts (76.35\%) accused of human values violation do not get downvoted at all. Finally, we find that the original posters rarely react to the concerns of potential human values violations by editing their posts. At the same time, they usually are receptive when responding to these comments in follow-up comments of their own.},

abstract = {With the development of Web 2.0 technology, Q&amp;A websites have become one of the most common avenues for large scale knowledge sharing. However, three types of barriers between questioners and respondents make knowledge sharing difficult:differences in the personality types of the questioners and respondents, lack of trust, and an arrogant or negative attitude exhibited by some questioners. In order to lower these barriers, we propose a Q&amp;A mediator system with virtual character agents. In this system, a questioner asks questions through his/her own agent, and the respondents see the question from their agent. Each agent has four characteristics:personality traits similar to knowledge sharers, good looks, affable personality, and a positive attitude. The results of a preliminary experiment indicated that the proposed system can improve the users' motivation to answer questions.},

abstract = {During software maintenance, testing is a crucial activity to ensure the quality of code as it evolves over time. With the increasing size and complexity of software, adequate software testing has become increasingly important. Developers often ask problems they face during testing on Community Question Answering (CQA) websites such as Stack Overflow. These websites can serve as good repositories to understand the common topics of discussions and challenges faced by developers during testing.  In this paper, we present a study of common challenges and important topics of discussion, by mining testing related questions asked on Stack Overflow. We use unsupervised learning to categorize the questions and rank all the Stack Overflow questions based on their importance. Our results show that topics such as test framework, database and client server are more often discussed compared to other topics. Also, there has been an uptrend for mobile development questions in testing related discussions.},

abstract = {The causes of software crashes can be hidden anywhere in the source code and development environment. When encountering software crashes, recurring bugs that are discussed on Q&amp;A sites could provide developers with solutions to their crashing problems. However, it is difficult for developers to accurately search for relevant content on search engines, and developers have to spend a lot of manual effort to find the right solution from the returned results. In this paper, we present CraSolver, an approach that takes into account both the structural information of crash traces and the knowledge of crash-causing bugs to automatically summarize solutions from crash traces. Given a crash trace, CraSolver retrieves relevant questions from Q&amp;A sites by combining a proposed position dependent similarity - based on the structural information of the crash trace - with an extra knowledge similarity, based on the knowledge from official documentation sites. After obtaining the answers to these questions from the Q&amp;A site, CraSolver summarizes the final solution based on a multi-factor scoring mechanism. To evaluate our approach, we built two repositories of Java and Android exception-related questions from Stack Overflow with size of 69,478 and 33,566 questions respectively. Our user study results using 50 selected Java crash traces and 50 selected Android crash traces show that our approach significantly outperforms four baselines in terms of relevance, usefulness, and diversity. The evaluation also confirms the effectiveness of the relevant question retrieval component in our approach for crash traces.},

abstract = {Online community question answering (CQA) social networking sites thrive when community members actively participate in the network. To influence participation, some CQA sites such as Stack Overflow reward members with incentives such as reputation, badges, and privileges. One way people earn such rewards is by posting helpful question and answers which get upvoted. An upvote is an indication of how useful a post is to the reader. An increase in a post’s upvotes could lead to the user who created the post accruing reputation and earning rewards in the community. To encourage people to write good posts, Stack Overflow has guidelines on their site for writing good question and answer posts. Despite these measures by Stack Overflow to encourage quality posts from community members, there are still several posts in the community with negative scores. A negative score indicates that the post received more downvotes than upvotes. If one consistently receives negative scores on their posts, it could influence them to stop using the network. Thus, it is important to identify the characteristics of posts with negative scores and explore how they differ from posts with positive scores. To contribute to research in this area, we identified the time of day posts were created, the sentiments and emotions used in writing the posts, the length of posts, and the topics that the posts were tagged with for posts with negative scores and those with positive scores. The result of our analysis on these two groups of posts suggests that posts created between 6.01&nbsp;pm and 12&nbsp;am received significantly higher scores than posts written at other times of the day. In addition, posts with positive scores were significantly longer in length than posts with negative scores. Furthermore, posts with positive scores were significantly more analytical and clout and less authentic compared to posts with negative scores.},

abstract = {During software development process, Chinese developers often seek solutions to the technical problems they encounter by searching relevant questions on Q&amp;A sites. When developers fail to find solutions on Q&amp;A sites in Chinese, they could translate their query and search on the English Q&amp;A sites. However, Chinese developers who are non-native English speakers often are not comfortable to ask or search questions in English, as they do not know the proper translation of the Chinese technical words into the English technical words. Furthermore, the process of manually formulating cross-language queries and determining the importance of query words is a tedious and time-consuming process. For the purpose of helping Chinese developers take advantages of the rich knowledge base of the English version of Stack Overflow and simplify the retrieval process, we propose an automated cross-language relevant question retrieval tool (XSearch) to retrieve relevant English questions on Stack Overflow for a given Chinese question. This tool can address the increasing need for developer to solve technical problems by retrieving cross-language relevant Q&amp;A resources.

Compared to prior works, DS- 1000 incorporates three core features. First, our problems reflect diverse, realistic, and practical use cases since we collected them from Stack-Overflow. Second, our automatic evaluation is highly specific (reliable) - across all Codex-002- predicted solutions that our evaluation accepts, only 1.8\% of them are incorrect; we achieve this with multi-criteria metrics, checking both functional correctness by running test cases and surface-form constraints by restricting API usages or keywords. Finally, we proactively defend against memorization by slightly modifying our problems to be different from the original Stack-Overflow source; consequently, models cannot answer them correctly by memorizing the solutions from pre-training. The current best public system (Codex-002) achieves 43.3\% accuracy, leaving ample room for improvement. We release our benchmark at https://ds1000-code-gen.github.io.},

abstract = {Collaboration in a construction project faces challenges of knowledge sharing among different team members across organisational and disciplinary boundaries. As an example of ICT innovation in the Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC) industry, Building Information Modelling (BIM) is thought to play a boundary object role in collaboration. The literature, however, is less clear on how BIM technology as a boundary object is used for knowledge sharing in construction projects. This paper conceptualises BIM technology as a boundary object for collaboration in a construction project from a knowledge-as-practice perspective. The conceptual framework explains how BIM technology as tools and artefacts become boundary objects-in-use in a construction project collaboration. The paper demonstrates how this can further contribute to our understanding of knowledge sharing in construction projects as a boundary spanning practice among different backgrounds. As success within an increasingly digitalised society depends on ICT-based collaborations of diverse teams and professionals, a deeper understanding regarding such boundary objects-in-use can be particularly useful.},

abstract = {This paper deals with knowledge sharing during a collaborative and design-based research project about game-based learning. According to a literature review about serious game design, a key process for collaborative work is knowledge sharing. This process is analysed with the frames of praxeologies and boundary objects. The praxeology framework aims to identify the participants’ practice and discourse about this practice for the design of serious games. The boundary objects framework aims to identify knowledge transactions during collaborative work. We collected data from workshops dedicated to co-design of TSADK, a serious game for computer education. We performed a thematic analysis on participants’ verbatim for nine workshops. The thematic analysis focuses on one subject: the learning outcomes of the game. The analysis has identified themes on this subject: to specify, to phrase and to select the main learning outcomes. Regarding these themes, the praxeology and boundary object frameworks allow us to identify common practice but no common knowledge and thus, an obstacle to collaboration. Based on these results, we propose a tool for supporting the collaboration design through sharing knowledge.},

abstract = {Developers can use different technologies for different software development tasks in their work. However, when faced with several technologies with comparable functionalities, it can be challenging for developers to select the most appropriate one, as trial and error comparisons among such technologies are time-consuming. Instead, developers resort to expert articles, read official documents or ask questions in Q&amp;A sites for technology comparison. However, it is still very opportunistic whether they will get a comprehensive comparison, as online information is often fragmented, contradictory and biased. To overcome these limitations, we propose the DiffTech system that exploits the crowd sourced discussions from Stack Overflow, and assists technology comparison with an informative summary of different comparison aspects. We found 19,118 comparative sentences from 2,410 pairs of comparable technologies. We released our DiffTech website for public use.

Recently, ChatGPT, a language model trained for dialog tasks, has been gaining attention as a promising approach for code snippet generation. However, there is still a need for in-depth analysis of the quality of its recommendations. In this work, we propose the evaluation of the readability of code snippets generated by ChatGPT, comparing them with those recommended by CROKAGE, a state-of-the-art code search engine for Stack Overflow. We compare the recommended snippets of both approaches using readability issues raised by the automated static analysis tool (ASAT) SonarQube. Our results show that ChatGPT can generate cleaner code snippets and more consistent naming and code conventions than those written by humans and recommended by CROKAGE. However, in some cases, ChatGPT generates code that lacks recent features from Java API such as try-with-resources, lambdas, and others. Overall, our findings suggest that ChatGPT can provide valuable assistance to developers searching for didactic and high-quality code snippets online. However, it is still important for developers to review the generated code, either manually or assisted by an ASAT, to prevent potential readability issues, as the correctness of the generated code snippets.},

abstract = {Question-and-answer (Q&amp;A) websites, such as Yahoo! Answers, Stack Overflow and Quora, have become a popular and powerful platform for Web users to share knowledge on a wide range of subjects. This has led to a rapidly growing volume of information and the consequent challenge of readily identifying high quality objects (questions, answers and users) in Q&amp;A sites. Exploring the interdependent relationships among different types of objects can help find high quality objects in Q&amp;A sites more accurately. In this paper, we specifically focus on the ranking problem of co-ranking questions, answers and users in a Q&amp;A website. By studying the tightly connected relationships between Q&amp;A objects, we can gain useful insights toward solving the co-ranking problem. However, co-ranking multiple objects in Q&amp;A sites is a challenging task: a) With the large volumes of data in Q&amp;A sites, it is important to design a model that can scale well; b) The large-scale Q&amp;A data makes extracting supervised information very expensive. In order to address these issues, we propose an unsupervised Network-based Co-Ranking framework (NCR) to rank multiple objects in Q&amp;A sites. Empirical studies on real-world Yahoo! Answers datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and the efficiency of the proposed NCR method.},

Method: We have analyzed 12,989 questions and answers posted on Stack Overflow. Topic modelling is conducted to derive the dominant topics in this domain. Further, a qualitative analysis was conducted to identify the key challenges discussed. Findings: Whilst the trend of posted questions is sharply increasing, the questions are becoming more specific to technologies and more difficult to attract answers. We identified 32 topics of discussions, among which "Error messages in Continuous Integration/Deployment" and "Continuous Integration concepts" are the most dominant. We also present the most challenging areas in this domain from the practitioners' perspectives.},

abstract = {Firebase is the leading Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) solution in the application development industry. It is globally used by millions of mobile applications and websites. Being a very popular and robust development platform, Firebase has introduced and developed many features and components over the years. Various services and modules are being added to the platform. So, the developers who use Firebase in their applications, need to have versatile knowledge of the platform. It is difficult to acquire an overview of the trends and discussions of any vast and dynamic platform such as Firebase. Therefore, learners, enthusiasts, and often developers have to put in a lot of effort to figure out topics they should explore and focus on. As a large number of application developers frequently use it and engage in various discussions about it in popular community discussion forums for developers, it has become a very promising source for identifying the topics and trends related to Firebase. Stack Overflow is the most popular community for developers’ discussions. It has grown to be a vast ocean of knowledge to explore. In this study, a systematic approach is followed to explore, extract, and analyze Stack Overflow discussions on Firebase to present an overview of the platform. Natural language processing and machine learning methods were used for extracting information from Stack Overflow data. Information collected was reviewed, analyzed, and compiled into this paper by the research group who have practical experiences in the Firebase platform and other relevant software engineering fields.},

abstract = {Source code search is frequently needed and important in software development. Keyword search for source code is a widely used but a limited approach. This paper presents CodeK\={o}an, a scalable engine for searching millions of online code examples written by the worldwide programmers' community which uses data parallel processing to achieve horizontal scalability. The search engine relies on a token-based, programming language independent algorithm and, as a proof-of-concept, indexes all code examples from Stack Overflow for two programming languages: Java and Python. This paper demonstrates the benefits of extracting crowd knowledge from Stack Overflow by analyzing well-known open source repositories such as OpenNLP and Elasticsearch: Up to one third of the source code in the examined repositories reuses code patterns from Stack Overflow. It also shows that the proposed approach recognizes similar source code and is resilient to modifications such as insertion, deletion and swapping of statements. Furthermore, evidence is given that the proposed approach returns very few false positives among the search results.},

abstract = {In many domains, strategic knowledge is documented and shared through checklists and handbooks. In software engineering, however, developers rarely share strategic knowledge for approaching programming problems, in contrast to other artifacts and despite its importance to productivity and success. To understand barriers to sharing, we simulated a programming strategy knowledge-sharing platform, asking experienced developers to articulate a programming strategy and others to use these strategies while providing feedback. Throughout, we asked strategy authors and users to reflect on the challenges they faced. Our analysis revealed that developers could share strategic knowledge. However, they struggled in choosing a level of detail and understanding the diversity of the potential audience. While authors required substantial feedback, users struggled to give it and authors to interpret it. Our results suggest that sharing strategic knowledge differs from sharing code and raises challenging questions about how knowledge-sharing platforms should support search and feedback.},

abstract = {There are several barriers to the knowledge management process in the current technological market environment that can affect software quality, especially in a distributed environment. One of them relates to the knowledge sharing needed to fulfill required tasks to ensure the projects’ deliverables. This paper is an experience report that assesses the gaps of knowledge (GoK) in the project leaders (PL) team. To accomplish this, it was carried out documental analysis and focus group sessions to review essential activities developed by the PL team during the software development process. Afterward, we carried out a survey to verify the GoK of PL team members related to their ability to perform essential activities to develop Security Maintenance Release projects. This paper also shows analyzes of three ways to share knowledge and a training program guidelines to eliminate existing GoK in the PL team. The findings reveal that although many factors affect the success rates of the knowledge sharing process, a training plan considering the combination of four factors can shorten the learning curve of PL team members. We hope this paper can contribute helping other knowledge-based companies and scientific community to increase their competitive advantages related to the knowledge sharing process and to minimize software quality problems such as rework effort and defective product delivery.},

Knowledge sharing and community promotion in the OHCs are critical to sustain their continuous use and improve their engagement. This study aims to investigate factors influencing knowledge sharing and community promotion in the OHC in the perspectives of social support, commitment-trust, and trust transfer theory. A questionnaire survey is employed as a collection data technique. The study results reveal that informational support influences trust transfer, trust towards community and members of the community. In addition, emotional support has a positive impact on community commitment and trust in community members but not in the community itself. Further, community commitment is positively related to both knowledge sharing and community promotion. While trust towards the community is only positively related to community promotion, trust towards members of the community does not have a positive influence on both knowledge sharing and community promotion. This study contributes to the understanding of the relationships among social support, community commitment, and trust transfer towards knowledge sharing and community promotion in the OHC. The findings of the study provide a research model that could be implemented in other contexts that share similar technology landscape.},

When these caveats are overlooked, errors may emerge, leading to heavy discussions on Q&amp;A websites like Stack Overflow. In this demonstration, we present API Caveat Explorer, a search system to explore API caveats that are mined from large-scale unstructured discussions on Stack Overflow. API Caveat Explorer takes API-oriented queries such as "HashMap" and retrieves API caveats by text summarization techniques. API caveats are represented by sentences, which are context-independent, prominent, semantically diverse and non-redundant. The system provides a web-based interface that allows users to interactively explore the full picture of all discovered caveats of an API, and the details of each. The potential users of API Caveat Explorer are programmers and educators for learning and teaching APIs.},

abstract = {Many novice programmers visit Stack Overflow for purposes that include posing questions and finding answers for issues they come across in the process of programming. Many questions have more than one correct answer on Stack Overflow, which are accompanied by number of comments from the users. Comments help developers in identifying the answer that better fits their purpose. However, it is difficult to navigate through all the comments to select an answer. Adding relevant visual cues to comments could help developers in prioritizing the comments to be read. Comments logged generally include sentiments of users, which, when depicted visually, could motivate users in reading through the comments and also help them in prioritizing the comments. However, the sentiment of comments is not being explicitly depicted on the current Stack Overflow platform. While there exist many tools that augment or annotate Stack Overflow platform for developers, we are not aware of tools that annotate visual representations of sentiments to the posts. In this paper, we propose StackEmo as a Google Chrome plugin to augment comments on Stack Overflow with emojis, based on the sentiment of the comments posted. We evaluated StackEmo through an in-user likert scale based survey with 30 university students to understand user perception towards StackEmo. The results of the survey provided us insights on improving StackEmo, with 83\% of the participants willing to recommend the plugin to their peers. The source code and tool are available for download on GitHub at: https://github.com/rishalab/StackEmo, and the demo can be found here on youtube: https://youtu.be/BCFlqvMhTMA.},

Yet it remains unclear what issues developers encounter during the development, which challenges cause the issues, and what solutions developers receive. In this paper, we aim to answer these questions via a study on developer discussions on Stack Overflow. By manually analyzing 586 highly relevant posts spanning 14 years, we observed a large variety (11 categories) of issues, dominated by those with interfacing and data handling among different languages. Behind these issues, we found that a major challenge developers faced is the diversity and complexity in multilingual code building and interoperability. Another key challenge lies in developers' lack of particular technical background on the diverse features of various languages (e.g., threading and memory management mechanisms). Meanwhile, Stack Overflow itself served as a key source of solutions to these challenges---the majority (73\%) of the posts received accepted answers eventually, and most in a week (36.5\% within 24 hours and 25\% in the next 6 days). Based on our findings on these issues, challenges, and solutions, we provide actionable insights and suggestions for both multi-language software researchers and developers.},

Answers and Stack Overflow provide a new way of asking and answering questions which are not well served by general web search engines. Due to the huge volume and ever-increasing number of questions, not all new questions can get fully answered in required time. Therefore, it is of great significance to design some effective strategies of recommending experts for new questions. In this paper, we propose a novel personalized recommendation method for routing new questions to a group of experts. Different from prior work which only considers the topic modeling or the link structure, we aim at recommending new questions to more appropriate experts by considering both of these two factors. Moreover, we design a new strategy of network construction with the personalization fully considered. The comparison experiments are conducted with Stack Overflow data and the experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method improves the recommendation performance over other methods in expert recommendation.},

abstract = {Stack Overflow has become an essential technical resource for developers. However, given the vast amount of knowledge available on Stack Overflow, finding the right information that is relevant for a given task is still challenging, especially when a developer is looking for a solution that applies to their specific requirements or technology stack. Clearly marking answers with their technical context, i.e., the information that characterizes the technologies and assumptions needed for this answer, is potentially one way to improve navigation. However, there is no information about how often such context is mentioned, and what kind of information it might offer. In this paper, we conduct an empirical study to understand the occurrence of technical context in Stack Overflow answers and comments, using tags as a proxy for technical context. We specifically focus on additional context, where answers/comments mention information that is not already discussed in the question. Our results show that nearly half of our studied threads contain at least one additional context. We find that almost 50\% of the additional context are either a library/framework, a programming language, a tool/application, an API, or a database. Overall, our findings show the promise of using additional context as navigational cues.},

abstract = {Q&amp;A forums are widely used in large classes to provide scalable support. In addition to offering students a space to ask questions, these forums aim to create a community and promote engagement. Prior literature suggests that the way students participate in Q&amp;A forums varies and that most students do not actively post questions or engage in discussions. Students may display different participation behaviours depending on their comfort levels in the class. This paper investigates students' use of a Q&amp;A forum in a CS1 course. We also analyze student opinions about the forum to explain the observed behaviour, focusing on students' lack of visible participation (lurking, anonymity, private posting). We analyzed forum data collected in a CS1 course across two consecutive years and invited students to complete a survey about perspectives on their forum usage. Despite a small cohort of highly engaged students, we confirmed that most students do not actively read or post on the forum. We discuss students' reasons for the low level of engagement and barriers to participating visibly. Common reasons include fearing a lack of knowledge and repercussions from being visible to the student community.},

abstract = {Developers often ask how-to questions using search engines, technical Q&amp;A communities, and interactive Q&amp;A systems to seek help for specific programming tasks. However, they often do not formulate the questions in a specific way, making it hard for the systems to return the best answers. We propose an approach (TaskKG4Q) that interactively helps developers formulate a programming related how-to question. TaskKG4Q is using a programming task knowledge graph (task KG in short) mined from Stack Overflow questions, which provides a hierarchical conceptual structure for tasks in terms of [actions], [objects], and [constraints]. An empirical evaluation of the intrinsic quality of the task KG revealed that 75.0\% of the annotated questions in the task KG are correct. The comparison between TaskKG4Q and two baselines revealed that TaskKG4Q can help developers formulate more specific how-to questions. More so, an empirical study with novice programmers revealed that they write more effective questions for finding answers to their programming tasks on Stack Overflow.},

abstract = {Stack Overflow and GitHub are two popular platforms containing API-related resources for developers to learn how to use APIs. The platforms are good sources for information about API such as code examples, usages, sentiment, bug reports, etc. However, it is difficult to collect the correct resources regarding a particular API due to the ambiguity of an API method name. An API method name mentioned in the text would only refer to one API, but the method name could match with different APIs. To help people in finding the correct resources for a particular API, we introduce ARSearch. ARSearch finds Stack Overflow threads that mention the particular API and their relevant code examples from GitHub. We demonstrate our tool by a video available at https://youtu.be/Rr-zTfUD_z0.},

abstract = {Achieving high performance with low energy consumption has become a primary design objective in multi-core systems. Recently, power management based on reinforcement learning has shown great potential in adapting to dynamic environments without much prior knowledge. However, conventional Q-learning (QL) algorithms adopted in most existing works encounter serious problems about scalability, instability, and overestimation. In this paper, we present a deep reinforcement learning-based approach to improve the stability and robustness of power management while reducing the energy-delay product (EDP) under user-specified performance requirements. The comprehensive status of the system is monitored periodically, making our controller sensitive to environmental change. To further improve the learning effectiveness, knowledge sharing among multiple devices is implemented in our approach. Experimental results on multiple realistic applications show that the proposed method can reduce the instability up to 68\% compared with QL. Through knowledge sharing among multiple devices, our federated approach achieves around 4.8\% EDP improvement over QL on average.},

abstract = {Code snippets are prevalent on websites such as Stack Overflow and are effective in demonstrating API usages concisely. However they are usually difficult to be used directly because most code snippets not only are syntactically incomplete but also lack dependency information, and thus do not compile. For example, Java snippets usually do not have import statements or required library names; only 6.88\% of Java snippets on Stack Overflow include import statements necessary for compilation.This paper proposes SnR, a precise, efficient, constraint-based technique to automatically infer the exact types used in code snippets and the libraries containing the inferred types, to compile and therefore reuse the code snippets. Initially, SnR builds a knowledge base of APIs, i.e., various facts about the available APIs, from a corpus of Java libraries. Given a code snippet with missing import statements, SnR automatically extracts typing constraints from the snippet, solves the constraints against the knowledge base, and returns a set of APIs that satisfies the constraints to be imported into the snippet.We have evaluated SnR on a benchmark of 267 code snippets from Stack Overflow. SnR significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art tool Coster. SnR correctly infers 91.0\% of the import statements, which makes 73.8\% of the snippets compile, compared to 36.0\% of the import statements and 9.0\% of the snippets by Coster.},

abstract = {Context: Recently, more and more developer communities are abandoning their legacy support forums, moving onto Stack Overflow. The motivations are diverse, yet they typically include achieving faster response time and larger visibility through the access to a modern and very successful infrastructure. One downside of migration, however, is that the history and the crowdsourced knowledge hosted at previous sites remain separated or even get lost if a community decides to abandon completely the legacy developer forum.Goal: Adding to the body of evidence of existing research on best-answer prediction, here we show that, from a technical perspective, the content from existing developer forums might be automatically migrated to the Stack Overflow, although most of forums do not allow to mark a question as resolved, a distinctive feature of modern Q&amp;A sites.Method: We trained a binary classifier with data from Stack Overflow and then tested it with data scraped from Docusign, a developer forum that has recently completed the move.Results: Our findings show that best answers can be predicted with a good accuracy, only relying on shallow linguistic (text) features, such as answer length and the number of sentences, combined with other features like answer upvotes and age, which can be easily computed in near real-time.Conclusions: Results provide an initial yet positive evidence towards the automatic migration of crowdsourced knowledge from legacy forums to modern Q&amp;A sites.},

Found solutions, i.e. forum posts containing relevant source code, are utilized in a copy and paste manner. This behavior carries the risk that vulnerabilities contained in the source code of the forum posts are spread. Software developers should be able to identify vulnerable source code at an early stage, thereby preventing copying the corresponding source code. In this paper, we introduce the tool CopypastaVulGuard that identifies vulnerable source code in forum posts and allows software developers to omit the source code by marking the forum posts as dangerous. Our tool consists of a browser extension and a management application capable to address as examples SQL injections, remote code executions and deprecated functions based on a dump of the archive.org Stack Overflow data set. We present an evaluation of our tool’s possible impact and relevance considering pros/cons and selected research questions.},

abstract = {Debugging can be challenging for novice and expert programmers alike. Programmers routinely turn to online resources such as Stack Overflow for help, but understanding of debugging search practices, as well as tool support to find debugging resources, remains limited. Existing tools that mine online help forums are generally not aimed at novices, and programmers face varying levels of success when looking for online resources. Furthermore, training online code search skills is pedagogically challenging, as we have little understanding of how expertise impacts programmers' web search behavior while debugging code.We help fill these knowledge gaps with the results of a study of 40 programmers investigating differences in Stack Overflow search behavior at three levels of expertise: novices, experienced programmers who are novices in Python (the language we use in our study), and experienced Python programmers. We observe significant differences between all three levels in their ability to find posts helpful for debugging a given error, with both general and language-specific expertise facilitating Stack Overflow search efficacy and debugging success. We also conduct an exploratory investigation of factors that correlate with this difference, such as the display rank of the selected link and the number of links checked per search query. We conclude with an analysis of how online search behavior and results vary by Python error type. Our findings can inform online code search pedagogy, as well as inform the development of future automated tools.},

abstract = {As one of the most well-known programmer Q&amp;A websites, Stack Overflow (i.e., SO) is serving tens of thousands of developers every day. Previous work has shown that many developers reuse the code snippets on SO when they find an answer (from SO) that functionally matches the programming problem they encounter in their development activities. To study how programmers reuse code on SO during project development, we conduct a comprehensive empirical study. First, to capture the development activities of programmers, we collect 342,148 modified code snippets in commits from 793 open-source Java projects, and these modified code can reflect the programming problems encountered during development. We also collect the code snippets from 1,355,617 posts on SO. Then, we employ CCFinder to detect the code clone between the modified code from commits and the code from SO, and further analyze the code reuse when programmer solves a programming problem during development. We count the code reuse ratios of the modified code snippets in the commits of each project in different years, the results show that the average code reuse ratio is 6.32\%, and the maximum is 8.38\%. The code reuse ratio in project commits has increased year by year, and the proportion of code reuse in the newly established project is higher than that of old projects. We also find that some projects reuse the code snippets from many years ago. Additionally, we find that experienced developers seem to be more likely to reuse the knowledge on SO. Moreover, we find that the code reuse ratio in bug-related commits (6.67\%) is slightly higher than that of in non-bug-related commits (6.59\%). Furthermore, we also find that the code reuse ratio (14.44\%) in Java class files that have undergone multiple modifications is more than double the overall code reuse ratio (6.32\%).},

The content of the Stack Overflow thread, which consists of both text paragraphs describing the involvement of the API method in the discussion and the code snippets containing the API invocation, may refer to the given API method. Leveraging this observation, we develop ARSeek, a context-specific algorithm to capture the semantic and syntactic information of the paragraphs and code snippets in a discussion. ARSeek combines a syntactic word-based score with a score from a predictive model fine-tuned from CodeBERT. In terms of F1-score, ARSeek achieves an average score of 0.8709 and beats the state-of-the-art approach by 14\%.},

abstract = {Background The emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted all human activity, including software development. Early reports seem to indicate that the pandemic may have had a negative effect on software developers, socially and personally, but that their software development productivity may not have been negatively impacted. Aims: Early reports about the effects of the pandemic on software development focused on software developers' well-being and on their productivity as employees. We are interested in a different aspect of software development: the developers' public contributions, as seen in GitHub and Stack Overflow activities. Did the pandemic affect the developers' public contributions and, of so, in what way? Method: Considering the data from between 2017 and till 2020, we study the trends within GitHub's push, create, pull request, and release events, and within Stack Overflow's new users, posts, votes, and comments. We performed linear regressions, correlation analyses, outlier analyses, hypothesis testing, and we also contacted individual developers in order to gather qualitative insights about their unusual public contributions. Results: Our study shows that within GitHub and Stack Overflow, the onset of the pandemic (March/April 2020) is reflected in a set of outliers in developers' contributions that point to an increase in activity. The distributions of contributions during the entire year of 2020 were, in some aspects, different, but, in other aspects, similar from the recent past. Additionally, we found one noticeably disrupted pattern of contribution in Stack Overflow, namely the ratio Questions/Answers, which was much higher in 2020 than before. Testimonials from the developers we contacted were mixed: while some developers reported that their increase in activity was due to the pandemic, others reported that it was not. Conclusion: In Github, there was a noticeable increase in public software development activity in 2020, as well as more abrupt changes in daily activities; in Stack Overflow, there was a noticeable increase in new users and new questions at the onset of the pandemic, and in the ratio of Questions/Answers during 2020. The results may be attributed to the pandemic, but other factors could have come into play.},

We focus on the hot and unresolved NFRs, the evolutions and trends of the NFRs in their discussions. We found that the most frequent topics the developers discuss are about usability and reliability while they concern few about maintainability and efficiency. The most unresolved problems also occurred in usability and reliability. Moreover, from the visualization of the NFR evolutions over time, we can find the trend for each NFR.},

In this work, we develop DeepTip, a novel deep learning-based approach using different Convolutional Neural Network architectures, to extract short practical and useful tips from developer answers. Our extensive empirical experiments prove that DeepTip can extract useful tips from a large corpus of answers to questions with high precision (i.e., avg. 0.854) and coverage (i.e., 0.94), and it outperforms two state-of-the-art baselines by up to 56.7\% and 162\%, respectively, in terms of Precision. Furthermore, qualitatively, a user study is conducted with real Stack Overflow users and its results confirm that tip extraction is useful and our approach generates high-quality tips.},

abstract = {This study examines the relationship between relationship communication and knowledge sharing by exploring the mediating effect of interpersonal trust in a virtual team environment. A multiple-mediation model was developed to examine this relationship, where cognitive trust and affective trust are defined as mediation variables between relationship communication and knowledge sharing. The main results of this study demonstrated significant positive correlations between relationship communication, trust, and knowledge sharing. Furthermore, this study identified interpersonal trust as playing an important role in mediating the relationship between task communication and knowledge sharing. However, only the rational aspect of trust has an impact, unlike that of the emotional aspect. Thus, only cognitive trust was found to be a mediator for knowledge sharing. This research model can help virtual teams resolve some of the emerging organizational challenges by increasing knowledge sharing.},

abstract = {Software design and development technologies evolve very fast and in unpredicted rates, posing many challenges for programmers who strive to use them properly and to be up-to-date, especially since software development demands teamwork and collaboration. As a result, Question and Answer (Q&amp;A) sites, like Stack Overflow, have seen large growth. The questions are characterized by tags, which support developers to easily trace their topic of interest. Very often, these tags refer to technologies that are connected or serve the same purpose. This work is motivated by the fact that despite the volume of questions and technologies change over time, tags inter-connections carry insightful information since they can be utilized to monitor the technology trends and their dynamics given technologies fast simultaneous evolution over time. This work recognizes the value of such connections, to reveal associations of technologies and to support the scientific community, which can be highly inspired by this study, using advanced data analysis tools. Benefits of the present study include early notification of the labor market needs, competency discovery and directions for educational planning. In the present study, graph theory principles and tools were employed to profile chronologically the evolution and the associations of technologies related to tags, and the experimentation carried out has involved the entire set of Stack Overflow questions posted during a decade, between 2008 and 2018. Very interesting conclusions are summarized based on the tags related to Computer Science Technologies (Hard Skills) analysis, revealing non-evident software technologies skills, associations and dynamics.},

abstract = {Software developers often submit questions to technical Q&amp;A sites like Stack Overflow (SO) to resolve their code-level problems. Usually, they include example code segments with their questions to explain the programming issues. When users of SO attempt to answer the questions, they prefer to reproduce the issues reported in questions using the given code segments. However, such code segments could not always reproduce the issues due to several unmet challenges (e.g., too short code segment) that might prevent questions from receiving appropriate and prompt solutions. A previous study produced a catalog of potential challenges that hinder the reproducibility of issues reported at SO questions. However, it is unknown how the practitioners (i.e., developers) perceive the challenge catalog. Understanding the developers’ perspective is inevitable to introduce interactive tool support that promotes reproducibility. We thus attempt to understand developers’ perspectives by surveying 53 users of SO. In particular, we attempt to – (1) see developers’ viewpoints on the agreement to those challenges, (2) find the potential impact of those challenges, (3) see how developers address them, and (4) determine and prioritize tool support needs. Survey results show that about 90\% of participants agree to the already exposed challenges. However, they report some additional challenges (e.g., error log missing) that might prevent reproducibility. According to the participants, too short code segment and absence of required Class/Interface/Method from code segments severely prevent reproducibility, followed by missing important part of code. To promote reproducibility, participants strongly recommend introducing tool support that interacts with question submitters with suggestions for improving the code segments if the given code segments fail to reproduce the issues.},

abstract = {The way knowledge is shared online is now constantly transforming with the advancement of technology. It is becoming more difficult now to sustain student’s attention in online knowledge sharing environment. Students tend to lose their attention quickly and no motivation to participate in the discussion activities posted by the lecturers. The current interface design is lacking of motivation factor to sustain students’ participation in online knowledge sharing activities. This paper describes design criteria that apply self-determination theory to self-motivate students in online knowledge sharing activities. The design criteria comprises game and social design elements. There are some typical game design elements used in user interface design are such as the points, badges, leaderboard, level, challenge, reward, progression and etc. These game design elements are now widely used in gamification applications. It was found that those design elements can motivate the students in their online knowledge sharing participation. The aim this paper is to provide the design criteria for a motivating user interface design that can promote students’ motivation to share their knowledge online. Previous study had identified a set design criteria based on content validity analysis for designing a motivating user interface. These set of design criteria were designed in a prototype interface called i-Discuss. Our finding reveal that motivation can be designed in user interface for online knowledge sharing activities. Future study will be conducted to evaluate the designed prototype.},

abstract = {In a competitive business environment, many companies struggle to align their resources to improve their performance. The resources should become one of the company's competitive advantage. One of those competitive advantages is knowledge assets. Knowledge assets can be developed by optimizing human resource management because not all companies want to invest funds to develop a knowledge management system. Initiation of knowledge sharing behavior among workforces is considered to be one of the most efficient ways. In Indonesia, it is predicted that 46\% of workforces in 2020 are millennials. Many previous studies have looked at millennial behavior in the work environment, and they are considered to potentially inhibit the development of the company's knowledge assets due to a high turnover rate. This paper is aimed to explore the factors that promote or discourage knowledge sharing behavior of millennials workforce. Factors studied included psychological, organizational culture, cognitive abilities, technological facilities, and so forth. The PLS method is used to explore these factors. A strategy has been developed as a recommendation for companies to initiate a knowledge sharing culture.},

abstract = {As a popular Q&amp;A site for programming, Stack Overflow is a treasure for developers. However, the amount of questions and answers on Stack Overflow make it difficult for developers to efficiently locate the information they are looking for. There are two gaps leading to poor search results: the gap between the user's intention and the textual query, and the semantic gap between the query and the post content. Therefore, developers have to constantly reformulate their queries by correcting misspelled words, adding limitations to certain programming languages or platforms, etc. As query reformulation is tedious for developers, especially for novices, we propose an automated software-specific query reformulation approach based on deep learning. With query logs provided by Stack Overflow, we construct a large-scale query reformulation corpus, including the original queries and corresponding reformulated ones. Our approach trains a Transformer model that can automatically generate candidate reformulated queries when given the user's original query. The evaluation results show that our approach outperforms five state-of-the-art baselines, and achieves a 5.6\% to 33.5\% boost in terms of ExactMatch and a 4.8\% to 14.4\% boost in terms of GLEU.},

abstract = {Stack Overflow is often viewed as one of the most influential Software Question \&amp; Answer (SQA) websites, containing millions of programming-related questions and answers. Tags play a critical role in efficiently structuring the contents in Stack Overflow and are vital to support a range of site operations, e.g., querying relevant contents. Poorly selected tags often introduce extra noise and redundancy, which raises problems like tag synonym and tag explosion. Thus, an automated tag recommendation technique that can accurately recommend high-quality tags is desired to alleviate the problems mentioned above.Inspired by the recent success of pre-trained language models (PTMs) in natural language processing (NLP), we present PTM4Tag, a tag recommendation framework for Stack Overflow posts that utilize PTMs with a triplet architecture, which models the components of a post, i.e., Title, Description, and Code with independent language models. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that leverages PTMs in the tag recommendation task of SQA sites. We comparatively evaluate the performance of PTM4Tag based on five popular pre-trained models: BERT, RoBERTa, ALBERT, CodeBERT, and BERTOverflow. Our results show that leveraging CodeBERT, a software engineering (SE) domain-specific PTM in PTM4Tag achieves the best performance among the five considered PTMs and outperforms the state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Network-based approach by a large margin in terms of average Precision@k, Recall@k, and F1-score@k. We conduct an ablation study to quantify the contribution of a post's constituent components (Title, Description, and Code Snippets) to the performance of PTM4Tag. Our results show that Title is the most important in predicting the most relevant tags, and utilizing all the components achieves the best performance.},

Most knowledge learning software is dedicated to sharing and disseminating knowledge by video. The form of video enables learners to better understand knowledge. With the rise of mobile short video, most mobile users will watch short video in their spare time. This paper combines micro video and knowledge sharing, and constructs a knowledge sharing platform based on micro video, where users can use short micro video to share knowledge and learn knowledge. In this paper, firstly, the knowledge sharing mode based on micro video is constructed, the user integration system is implemented, and the mode of user internal evaluation video is designed. Secondly, the requirements of the platform are defined and analyzed. Finally, the logic model of the platform is designed, and the overall design and detailed design scheme are proposed. The construction of this platform promotes the further development of mobile learning, which is conducive to users' autonomous and fragmented learning anytime and anywhere.},

abstract = {Domain adaptation (DA) tries to tackle the scenarios when the test data does not fully follow the same distribution of the training data, and multi-source domain adaptation (MSDA) is very attractive for real world applications. By learning from large-scale unlabeled samples, self-supervised learning has now become a new trend in deep learning. It is worth noting that both self-supervised learning and multi-source domain adaptation share a similar goal: they both aim to leverage unlabeled data to learn more expressive representations. Unfortunately, traditional multi-task self-supervised learning faces two challenges: (1) the pretext task may not strongly relate to the downstream task, thus it could be difficult to learn useful knowledge being shared from the pretext task to the target task; (2) when the same feature extractor is shared between the pretext task and the downstream one and only different prediction heads are used, it is ineffective to enable inter-task information exchange and knowledge sharing. To address these issues, we propose a novel Self-Supervised Graph Neural Network (SSG), where a graph neural network is used as the bridge to enable more effective inter-task information exchange and knowledge sharing. More expressive representation is learned by adopting a mask token strategy to mask some domain information. Our extensive experiments have demonstrated that our proposed SSG method has achieved state-of-the-art results over four multi-source domain adaptation datasets, which have shown the effectiveness of our proposed SSG method from different aspects.},

abstract = {We focus on detecting potential topical experts in community question answering platforms early on in their lifecycle. We use a semi-supervised machine learning approach. We extract three types of feature: (i) textual, (ii) behavioral, and (iii) time-aware, which we use to predict whether a user will become an expert in the longterm. We compare our method to a machine learning method based on a state-of-the-art method in expertise retrieval. Results on data from Stack Overflow demonstrate the utility of adding behavioral and time-aware features to the baseline method with a net improvement in accuracy of 26\% for very early detection of expertise.},

abstract = {Systems for Community Question Answering (CQA) are well-known on the open web (e.g. Stack Overflow or Quora). They have been recently adopted also for use in educational domain (mostly in MOOCs) to mediate communication between students and teachers. As students are only novices in topics they learn about, they may need various scaffoldings to achieve effective question answering. In this work, we focus specifically on automatic recommendation of tags classifying students' questions. We propose a novel method that can automatically analyze a text of a question and suggest appropriate tags to an asker. The method takes specifics of educational domain into consideration by a two-step recommendation process in which tags reflecting course structure are recommended at first and consequently supplemented with additional related tags.Evaluation of the method on data from CS50 MOOC at Stack Exchange platform showed that the proposed method achieved higher performance in comparison with a baseline method (tag recommendation without taking educational specifics into account).},

abstract = {Motivation: Code search is an important activity in software development since developers are regularly searching [6] for code examples dealing with diverse programming concepts, APIs, and specific platform peculiarities. To help developers search for source code, several Internet-scale code search engines, such as OpenHub [5] and Codota [1] have been proposed. Unfortunately, these Internet-scale code search engines have limited performance since they treat source code as natural language documents. To improve the performance of search engines, the construction of the search space index as well as the mapping process of querying must address the challenge that "no single word can be chosen to describe a programming concept in the best way" [2]. This is known in the literature as the vocabulary mismatch problem [3].Approach: We propose a novel approach to augmenting user queries in a free-form code search scenario. This approach aims at improving the quality of code examples returned by Internet-scale code search engines by building a Code voCaBulary (CoCaBu) [7]. The originality of CoCaBu is that it addresses the vocabulary mismatch problem, by expanding/enriching/re-targeting a user's free-form query, building on similar questions in Q&amp;A sites so that a code search engine can find highly relevant code in source code repositories. Figure 1 provides an overview of our approach.The search process begins with a free-form query from a user,i.e., a sentence written in a natural language:(a) For a given query, CoCaBu first searches for relevant posts in Q&amp;A forums. The role of the Search Proxy is then to forward developer free-form queries to web search engines that can collect and rank entries in Q&amp;A with the most relevant documents for the query.(b) CoCaBu then generates an augmented query based on the information in the relevant posts. It mainly leverages code snippets in the previously identified posts. The Code Query Generator then creates another query which includes not only the initial user query terms but also program elements. To accelerate this step in the search process, CoCaBu builds upfront a snippet index for Q&amp;A posts.(c) Once the augmented query is constructed, CoCaBu searches source files for code locations that match the query terms. For this step, we crawl a large number of repositories and build upfront a code index of program elements in the source code.Contributions:• CoCaBu approach to the vocabulary mismatch problem: We propose a technique for finding relevant code with freeform query terms that describe programming tasks, with no a-priori knowledge on the API keywords to search for.• GitSearch free-form search engine for GitHub: We instantiate the CoCaBu approach based on indices of Java files built from GitHub and Q&amp;A posts from Stack Overflow to find the most relevant code examples for developer queries.• Empirical user evaluation: Comparison with popular code search engines further shows that GitSearch is more effective in returning acceptable code search results. In addition, Comparison against web search engines indicates that GitSearch is a competitive alternative. Finally, via a live study, we show that users on Q&amp;A sites may find GitSearch's real code examples acceptable as answers to developer questions.Concluding remarks: As a follow-up work, we have also leveraged Stack Overflow data to build a practical, novel, and efficient code-to-code search engine [4].},

abstract = {Software developers use Stack Overflow on a daily basis to search for solutions to problems they encounter during bug fixing and feature enhancement. In prior work, studies have been done on mining Stack Overflow data such as for predicting unanswered questions or how and why people post. However, no work exists on how developers actually use, or more importantly, read the information presented to them on Stack Overflow. To better understand this behavior, we conduct an eye tracking study on how developers seek for information on Stack Overflow while tasked with creating human-readable summaries of methods and classes in large Java projects. Eye gaze data is collected on both the source code elements and Stack Overflow document elements at a fine token-level granularity using iTrace, our eye tracking infrastructure. We found that developers look at the text more often than the title in posts. Code snippets were the second most looked at element. Tags and votes are rarely looked at. When switching between Stack Overflow and the Eclipse Integrated Development Environment (IDE), developers often looked at method signatures and then switched to code and text elements on Stack Overflow. Such heuristics provide insight to automated code summarization tools as they decide what to give more weight to while generating summaries.},

abstract = {Stack Overflow is the most popular discussion platform for software developers. However, recent research identified a large amount of insecure encryption code in production systems that has been inspired by examples given on Stack Overflow. By copying and pasting functional code, developers introduced exploitable software vulnerabilities into security-sensitive high-profile applications installed by millions of users every day.Proposed mitigations of this problem suffer from usability flaws and push developers to continue shopping for code examples on Stack Overflow once again. This motivates us to fight the proliferation of insecure code directly at the root before it even reaches the clipboard. By viewing Stack Overflow as a market, implementation of cryptography becomes a decision-making problem. In this context, our goal is to simplify the selection of helpful and secure examples. More specifically, we focus on supporting software developers in making better decisions on Stack Overflow by applying nudges, a concept borrowed from behavioral economics and psychology. This approach is motivated by one of our key findings: For 99.37\% of insecure code examples on Stack Overflow, similar alternatives are available that serve the same use case and provide strong cryptography.Our system design that modifies Stack Overflow is based on several nudges that are controlled by a deep neural network. It learns a representation for cryptographic API usage patterns and classification of their security, achieving average AUC-ROC of 0.992. With a user study, we demonstrate that nudge-based security advice significantly helps tackling the most popular and error-prone cryptographic use cases in Android.},

abstract = {Background: Modern code review is expected to facilitate knowledge sharing: All relevant information, the collective expertise, and meta-information around the code change and its context become evident, transparent, and explicit in the corresponding code review discussion. The discussion participants can leverage this information in the following code reviews; the information diffuses through the communication network that emerges from code review. Traditional time-aggregated graphs fall short in rendering information diffusion as those models ignore the temporal order of the information exchange: Information can only be passed on if it is available in the first place. Aim: This manuscript presents a novel model based on time-varying hypergraphs for rendering information diffusion that overcomes the inherent limitations of traditional, time-aggregated graph-based models. Method: In an in-silico experiment, we simulate an information diffusion within the internal code review at Microsoft and show the empirical impact of time on a key characteristic of information diffusion: the number of reachable participants. Results: Time-aggregation significantly overestimates the paths of information diffusion available in communication networks and, thus, is neither precise nor accurate for modelling and measuring the spread of information within communication networks that emerge from code review. Conclusion: Our model overcomes the inherent limitations of traditional, static or time-aggregated, graph-based communication models and sheds the first light on information diffusion through code review. We believe that our model can serve as a foundation for understanding, measuring, managing, and improving knowledge sharing in code review in particular and information diffusion in software engineering in general.},

abstract = {Federated Learning (FL) protects privacy during autonomous vehicle machine learning (ML) operations. FL enables cooperative training of a single ML model across multiple edge devices, leveraging distributed datasets while maintaining data locality. Although much research has concentrated on single-server FL for autonomous driving applications within vehicular networks, real-world scenarios often involve several concurrent servers capable of benefiting from each other's knowledge. However, these servers' trustworthiness is paramount when using their global models, as an imprudent choice could significantly decrease FL performance and accuracy. In this paper, we introduce a novel trust-based knowledge-sharing approach among FL servers, wherein the accuracy of shared global models on clients' local data serves as the trust metric. Our proposed methodology enables servers to utilize shared global models from reliable servers for their clients, thereby improving training accuracy and reducing loss. This enhancement is particularly notable during the initial training rounds compared to base FL implementation.},

abstract = {Collective intelligence of the crowds is distilled together in various Community Question Answering (CQA) Services such as Quora, Yahoo Answers, Stack Overflow forums, wherein users share their knowledge, providing both informational and experiential support to other users. As users often search for similar information, probabilities are high that for a new incoming question, there is a related question-answer pair existing in the CQA dataset. Therefore, an efficient technique for similar question identification is need of the hour. While data is not a bottleneck in this scenario, addressing the vocabulary diversity generated by a variety pool of users certainly is. This paper proposes a novel tripartite neural network based approach towards the similar question retrieval problem. The network takes inputs in the form of question-answer and new question triplet and learns internal representations from similarities among them. Our approach achieves classification performances upto 77\% on a real world CQA dataset.We have also compared our method with two other baselines and found that it performs significantly better in handling the problem of vocabulary diversity and 'zero-lexical overlap' among questions.},

abstract = {Software developers are increasingly dependent on question and answer portals and blogs for coding solutions. While such interfaces provide useful information, there are concerns that code hosted here is often incorrect, insecure or incomplete. Previous work indeed detected a range of faults in code provided on Stack Overflow through the use of static analysis. Static analysis may go a far way towards quickly establishing the health of software code available online. In addition, mechanisms that enable rapid automated program improvement may then enhance such code. Accordingly, we present this proof of concept. We use the PMD static analysis tool to detect performance faults for a sample of Stack Overflow Java code snippets, before performing mutations on these snippets using GIN. We then re-analyse the performance faults in these snippets after the GIN mutations. GIN's RandomSampler was used to perform 17,986 unique line and statement patches on 3,034 snippets where PMD violations were removed from 770 patched versions. Our outcomes indicate that static analysis techniques may be combined with automated program improvement methods to enhance publicly available code with very little resource requirements. We discuss our planned research agenda in this regard.},

The review process was conducted from 1986 to 2018 with 77 papers finally employed for this study. Study findings indicated that four research variables concerning the model contained knowledge sharing, knowledge resources, knowledge needs, and knowledge creation for analysis. Ideally, the model can be further used as a new framework to propose the implementing knowledge management strategy for non-profit sectors.},

In many organizations, knowledge management is often inadequate when it comes to web-based knowledge sharing, particularly among academics who work in Saudi universities. To ensure that a knowledge sharing system can be well implemented when communicating internally in an academic context, there is a need to know why academics accept or reject the use of web-based knowledge sharing systems. Therefore, the aim of this research is to determine the factors that affect academics' behaviours toward using web technology to share knowledge in Saudi universities. A web-based knowledge sharing adoption model is constructed based on the factors which already exist in technology acceptance theories, such as the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology and task-technology fit, as well as other factors which are explored in knowledge sharing literature reviews to enrich the proposed model.},

abstract = {Online questioning and answering (Q&amp;A) communities have become an essential social media platform for individuals to exchange specialized knowledge and collaboratively solve problems. Various gamified design elements (such as reputation scores, badges, levels, and leaderboards, etc.) have been applied in online Q&amp;A communities to motivate users’ knowledge contribution on which the sustainability of such communities depends. Current studies generally assume that motivational sources originate directly from the gamified elements. From the perspective of social comparison theory, this research proposes that the motivational affordances motivating knowledge contribution in online communities can be activated from the comparison of virtual rewards offered by gamified design features. Thus, the effect of gamified elements on a user’s behavior is determined, at least partially, by the social influence of how other users in the community are rewarded by the gamification mechanism. This research contributes to theory by providing a new perspective for understanding the effect of gamification on knowledge contribution in online Q&amp;A communities. It also provides important practical implications for the design and management of sustainable online communities.},

An interpretivist case study of Stack Overflow was carried out. Seven categories of motivation were identified from the literature; fun, ideology, reputation, reciprocity, efficacy, attachment, and structural capital. Self-determination theory and the notion of knowledge as a public versus a private good were used as theoretical lenses to understand contributor motivation under each of these categories. Findings from the case identified important emergent themes such as the need for involvement in a community prior to contribution, and the importance of considering factors that discourage contribution in addition to those that encourage contribution when researching the contributor phenomenon.The paper argues that self-determination theory is a useful theoretical lens to apply to the study of contributor motivation, and whilst the notion of knowledge as a public versus a private good is useful to understanding some of the motivations found in the literature, increased complexity of knowledge sharing online communities reduces the utility of this theoretical lens, as evidenced by the case of Stack Overflow.},

abstract = {Stack Overflow is a highly successful Community Question Answering (CQA) service for software developers with more than three millions users and more than ten thousand posts per day. The large volume of questions makes it difficult for users to find questions that they are interested in answering. In this paper, we propose a number of approaches to predict who will answer a new question using the characteristics of the question (i.e. Topic) and users (i.e. Reputation), and the social network of Stack Overflow users (i.e. Interested in the same topic). Specifically, our approach aims to identify a group of users (candidates) who have the potential to answer a new question by using feature-based prediction approach and social network based prediction approach. We develop predictive models to predict whether an identified candidate answers a new question. This prediction helps motivate the knowledge exchanging in the community by routing relevant questions to potential answerers. The evaluation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our predictive models, achieving 44\% precision, 59\% recall, and 49\% F-measure (average across all test sets). In addition, our candidate identification techniques can identify the answerers who actually answer questions up to 12.8\% (average across all test sets).},

Using a mixed methods approach, the study proposes a knowledge sharing system requirement framework (KSSRF) which could be used as a guide for AIs to develop their KSS. The requirements framework was developed after studying the knowledge sharing behavior (KSB) of academician end users in a public AI. Both quantitative and qualitative analyses were used to extract and describe findings. The research contributes to the KSS field through the development of a KSSRF which draws upon both quantitative and qualitative findings. AI administrators could employ the proposed framework as a guide for KS activities among academicians in their own institutions.},

abstract = {Globalizations makes world become smaller. It is easier to interact, communicate, connect and create business with another people in over the world. This opportunity is frequently optimized by business stakeholders to build multinational corporations, corporations that have products and branches in other countries. Culture, language and geographically differences remain and become challenges to manage knowledge over the headquarter and branches, including how to share knowledge. They influence how multinational corporations should optimize and use technology for better knowledge sharing process so they can keep benefit advantages, can compete to their competitors, or even keep their business runs well. This paper will review, compare and analyze mechanism and technology usage of knowledge sharing for multinational corporations. The sample of multinational corporations used is multinational corporations from many different countries with different area or industry. This research will result most of the mechanism and technology used to support and facilitate the knowledge share mechanism in multinational corporations.},

abstract = {Multi-task learning (MTL) aims to enhance the performance and efficiency of machine learning models by simultaneously training them on multiple tasks. However, MTL research faces two challenges: 1) effectively modeling the relationships between tasks to enable knowledge sharing, and 2) jointly learning task-specific and shared knowledge. In this paper, we present a novel model called Adaptive Task-to-Task Fusion Network (AdaTT) to address both challenges. AdaTT is a deep fusion network built with task-specific and optional shared fusion units at multiple levels. By leveraging a residual mechanism and a gating mechanism for task-to-task fusion, these units adaptively learn both shared knowledge and task-specific knowledge. To evaluate AdaTT's performance, we conduct experiments on a public benchmark and an industrial recommendation dataset using various task groups. Results demonstrate AdaTT significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, our end-to-end experiments reveal that the model exhibits better performance compared to alternatives.},

abstract = {One of the challenges of math information retrieval is the inherent ambiguity of mathematical notation. The use of various notations, symbols, and conventions can lead to ambiguities in math search queries, potentially causing confusion and errors. Therefore, asking clarifying questions in math search can help remove these ambiguities. Despite advances in incorporating clarifying questions for search, little is currently understood about the characteristics of these questions in math. This paper investigates math clarifying questions asked on the MathStackExchange community question answering platform, analyzing a total of 495,431 clarifying questions and their usefulness. The results of the analysis uncover specific patterns in useful clarifying questions that provide insight into the design considerations for future conversational math search systems. The formulae used in clarifying questions are closely related to those in the initial queries and are accompanied by common phrases, seeking for the missing information related to the formulae. Additionally, experiments utilizing clarifying questions for math search demonstrate the potential benefits of incorporating them alongside the original query.},

abstract = {This paper focuses on continual meta-learning, where few-shot tasks are heterogeneous and sequentially available. Recent works use a mixture model for meta-knowledge to deal with the heterogeneity. However, these methods suffer from parameter inefficiency caused by two reasons: (1) the underlying assumption of mutual exclusiveness among mixture components hinders sharing meta-knowledge across heterogeneous tasks. (2) they only allow increasing mixture components and cannot adaptively filter out redundant components. In this paper, we propose an Adaptive Compositional Continual Meta-Learning (ACML) algorithm, which employs a compositional premise to associate a task with a subset of mixture components, allowing meta-knowledge sharing among heterogeneous tasks. Moreover, to adaptively adjust the number of mixture components, we propose a component sparsification method based on evidential theory to filter out redundant components. Experimental results show ACML outperforms strong baselines, showing the effectiveness of our compositional meta-knowledge, and confirming that ACML can adaptively learn meta-knowledge.},

abstract = {Rehearsal-based approaches are a mainstay of continual learning (CL). They mitigate the catastrophic forgetting problem by maintaining a small fixed-size buffer with a subset of data from past tasks. While most rehearsal-based approaches exploit the knowledge from buffered past data, little attention is paid to inter-task relationships and to critical task-specific and task-invariant knowledge. By appropriately leveraging inter-task relationships, we propose a novel CL method, named DualHSIC, to boost the performance of existing rehearsal-based methods in a simple yet effective way. DualHSIC consists of two complementary components that stem from the so-called Hilbert Schmidt independence criterion (HSIC): HSIC-Bottleneck for Rehearsal (HBR) lessens the inter-task interference and HSIC Alignment (HA) promotes task-invariant knowledge sharing. Extensive experiments show that DualHSIC can be seamlessly plugged into existing rehearsal-based methods for consistent performance improvements, outperforming recent state-of-the-art regularization-enhanced rehearsal methods.},

The safety of a scenario involving multiple intelligent vehicles and infrastructures depends on delicate design of their collaboration. A unified and efficient representation for knowledge sharing and fusion is essential for such collaboration. However, the existing logical representation of spatial knowledge seldom considers integrating the knowledge from distributed agents with different granularities of views and data models. This paper designs a novel spatial logic based on a hierarchical spatial model, and provides a knowledge fusion method based on view and grained conversion between distributed agents. The spatial logic can be used to specify and share the key spatial knowledge in vehicle infrastructure cooperation scenarios. The converted knowledge shared by other agents is beneficial for an intelligent vehicle to improve its cognition and decision-making process. The effectiveness of our approach is illustrated with the case studies in path planning and cooperative cross-traffic turning.},

abstract = {Services, such as Stack Overflow, offer a web platform to programmers for discussing technical issues, in form of Question and Answers (Q&amp;A). Since Q&amp;A services store the discussions, the generated crowd knowledge can be accessed and consumed by a large audience for a long time. Nevertheless, Q&amp;A services are detached from the development environments used by programmers: Developers have to tap into this crowd knowledge through web browsers and cannot smoothly integrate it into their workflow. This situation hinders part of the benefits of Q&amp;A services. To better leverage the crowd knowledge of Q&amp;A services, we created Seahawk, an Eclipse plugin that supports an integrated and largely automated approach to assist programmers using Stack Overflow. Seahawk formulates queries automatically from the active context in the IDE, presents a ranked and interactive list of results, lets users import code samples in discussions through drag \&amp; drop and link Stack Overflow discussions and source code persistently as a support for team work.

abstract = {Community question answering(CQA) services have arisen as a popular knowledge sharing pattern for netizens. With abundant interactions among users, individuals are capable of obtaining satisfactory information. However, it is not effective for users to attain satisfying answers within minutes. Users have to check the progress over time until the appropriate answers submitted. We address this problem as a user personalized satisfaction prediction task. Existing methods usually exploit manual feature selection. It is not desirable as it requires careful design and is labor intensive. In this paper, we settle this issue by developing a new multiple instance deep learning framework. Specifically, in our settings, each question follows a multiple instance learning assumption, where its obtained answers can be regarded as instance sets in a bag and we define the question resolved with at least one satisfactory answer. We design an efficient framework exploiting multiple instance learning property with deep learning tactic to model the question-answer pairs relevance and rank the asker's satisfaction possibility. Extensive experiments on large-scale datasets from different forums of Stack Exchange demonstrate the feasibility of our proposed framework in predicting asker personalized satisfaction.},

abstract = {Predicting brain tumor survival can aid physicians in better assessing the efficacy of treatments and adjusting treatment plans in clinical practices to enhance patient survival. Recently, deep learning techniques have attracted massive attention in predicting brain tumor survival. However, the majority of existing methods necessitate at least two or more independent networks for knowledge sharing later in the model and overlook the significance of population information. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end multi-model brain tumor survival prediction (MPSurv) model that incorporates patient population information. Moreover, given the presence of censored data, we propose to address this issue by generating pseudo-labels, which in turn augments the original data and improves the utilization of the dataset. We have collected and supplemented survival labels based on the BraTS 2021 dataset for the training and validation of segmentation and prediction tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that our model enhances the accuracy of brain tumor survival prediction and exhibits superior generalizability. The source code is available at: .},

In this paper, we study the duplication of code snippets between two popular sources of software development information: the Stack Overflow Q&amp;A site and software development tutorials. Our goals are to empirically understand the scale of repeated information between these two sources, to gain insight into why developers copy information from one source to the other, and to understand the evolution of duplicated information over time. To this end, we correlate a set of nearly 600 tutorials on Android available on the Web to the SOTorrent dataset, which isolates code snippets from Stack Overflow posts and tracks their changes over time. Our findings reveal that there are over 1,400 duplicate code snippets related to Android on Stack Overflow. Code that was duplicated on the two sources is effective at answering Stack Overflow questions; a significant number (31\%) of answers that contained a duplicate code block were chosen as the accepted answer. Qualitative analysis reveals that developers commonly use Stack Overflow to ask clarifying questions about code they reused from tutorials, and copy code snippets from tutorials to provide answers to questions.},

The exponential growing rate of the unanswered questions compromises the effectiveness of the CQA frameworks as knowledge sharing platforms. The main reason for this issue is the inefficient routing of the questions to the potential answerers, who are the field experts and interested users.This paper proposes the deep-learning-based technique QR-DSSM to increase the accuracy of the question routing process. This technique uses deep semantic similarity model (DSSM) to extract semantic similarity features using deep neural networks and use the features to rank users' profiles. QR-DSSM maps the asked questions and the profiles of the users into a latent semantic space where the ability to answer is measured using the cosine similarity between the questions and the profiles of the users. QR-DSSM experiments outperformed the baseline models such as LDA, SVM, and Rank-SVM techniques and achieved an MRR score of 0.1737.},

Research has shown that offensive language drives users away from active engagement within these platforms. This work aims to explore this issue more broadly by investigating the nature of offensive language in comments posted by users in four prominent SE platforms – GitHub, Gitter, Slack and Stack Overflow (SO). It proposes an approach to detect and classify offensive language in SE communities by adopting natural language processing and deep learning techniques. Further, a Conflict Reduction System (CRS), which identifies offence and then suggests what changes could be made to minimize offence has been proposed. Beyond showing the prevalence of offensive language in over 1 million comments from four different communities which ranges from 0.07\% to 0.43\%, our results show promise in successful detection and classification of such language. The CRS system has the potential to drastically reduce manual moderation efforts to detect and reduce offence in SE communities.},

abstract = {Since the first computer ENIAC was born in 1946, it has been over half a century and technologies which develop rapidly have changed the way of knowledge sharing notably. By means of technologies, community entities were transported to the Internet in early times and became the prototype of online learning community. With the range expansion of social media, the functions of learning community increase and technology as scaffold supports communication and knowledge sharing widely. Recently, Artificial Intelligence(AI) makes knowledge sharing elaborately through all kinds of agents and intelligent tutoring systems. In this paper, we quote cases to analyze how knowledge sharing benefits from technology development in different stages and list intelligent technology enhancement for learning specifically.},

abstract = {This paper introduces a local search method for improving an existing program with respect to a measurable objective. Program Optimization with Locally Improving Search (POLIS) exploits the structure of a program, defined by its lines. POLIS improves a single line of the program while keeping the remaining lines fixed, using existing brute-force synthesis algorithms, and continues iterating until it is unable to improve the program's performance. POLIS was evaluated with a 27-person user study, where participants wrote programs attempting to maximize the score of two single-agent games: Lunar Lander and Highway. POLIS was able to substantially improve the participants' programs with respect to the game scores. A proof-ofconcept demonstration on existing Stack Overflow code measures applicability in real-world problems. These results suggest that POLIS could be used as a helpful programming assistant for programming problems with measurable objectives.},

abstract = {Infusing external domain-specific knowledge about diverse biomedical concepts and relationships into language models (LMs) advances their ability to handle specialised in-domain tasks like medical concept normalization (MCN). However, existing biomedical LMs are primarily trained with contrastive learning using synonymous concept names from a terminology (e.g., UMLS) as positive anchors, while accurate aggregation of the features of graph nodes and neighbors remains a challenge. In this paper, we present Graph-Enriched Biomedical Entity Representation Transformer (GEBERT) which captures graph structural data from the UMLS via graph neural networks and contrastive learning. In GEBERT, we enrich the entity representations by introducing an additional graph-based node-level contrastive objective. To enable mutual knowledge sharing among the textual and the structural modalities, we minimize the contrastive objective between a concept’s node representation and its textual embedding obtained via LM. We explore several state-of-the-art convolutional graph architectures, namely GraphSAGE and GAT, to learn relational information from local node neighborhood. After task-specific supervision, GEBERT achieves state-of-the-art results on five MCN datasets in English.},

abstract = {Society 5.0 envisions a more resilient, sustainable, and human-centered society fostered by ever-evolving cooperation and knowledge sharing among the many digital systems already shaping our daily lives. However, the current state of smart cities often consists of siloed systems, with different actors and stakeholders managing their services and assets independently. This phenomenon is evident in both technological and operational domains, posing challenges to seamless collaboration. In this context, new cloud computing models and technologies like event and service mesh promise to reduce the burden associated with the development and integration of solutions. In the attempt to pave the way for more integrated IT environments, we propose a practical architecture that combines service and event mesh technologies, enabling the seamless exploitation of service invocation and composition based on event distribution and direct service calls. Our proposal allows applications to remain transparent of the underlying technology, facilitating various optimizations on the network and management plane, necessary to meet the diverse operational requirements of complex and heterogeneous applications. We validate our proposal in a real-use case scenario implementation, discussing the tradeoffs that emerge.},

Many of these issues are discussed on Q&amp;A-sites, such as Stack Overflow. In this paper we present a manual categorization of 450 Android related posts of Stack Overflow concerning their question and problem types. The idea is to find dependencies between certain problems and question types to get better insights into issues of Android App development. The categorization is developed using card sorting with three experienced Android App developers. An initial approach to automate the classification of Stack Overflow posts using Lucene is also presented. The study highlights that the most common question types are 'How to…?' and 'What is the problem…?'. The problems that are discussed most often are related to 'User Interface' and 'Core Elements'. In particular, the problem category 'Layout' is often related to 'What is the problem…?' and 'Frameworks' issues often come with 'Is it possible…?' questions.},

abstract = {Developers introduce bugs during software development which reduce software reliability. Many of these bugs are commonly occurring and have been experienced by many other developers. Informing developers, especially novice ones, about commonly occurring bugs in a domain of interest (e.g., Java), can help developers comprehend program and avoid similar bugs in the future. Unfortunately, information about commonly occurring bugs are not readily available. To address this need, we propose a novel approach named RFEB which recommends frequently encountered bugs (FEBugs) that may affect many other developers. RFEB analyzes Stack Overflow which is the largest software engineering-specific Q&amp;A communities. Among the plenty of questions posted in Stack Overflow, many of them provide the descriptions and solutions of different kinds of bugs. Unfortunately, the search engine that comes with Stack Overflow is not able to identify FEBugs well. To address the limitation of the search engine of Stack Overflow, we propose RFEB which is an integrated and iterative approach that considers both relevance and popularity of Stack Overflow questions to identify FEBugs. To evaluate the performance of RFEB, we perform experiments on a dataset from Stack Overflow which contains more than ten million posts. We compared our model with Stack Overflow's search engine on 10 domains, and the experiment results show that RFEB achieves the average NDCG10 score of 0.96, which improves Stack Overflow's search engine by 20\%.},

abstract = {Context. The accumulation of technical debt (TD) items can lead to risks in software projects, such a gradual decrease in product quality, difficulties in their maintenance, and ultimately the cancellation of the project. To mitigate these risks, developers need means to identify TD items, which enable better documentation and improvements in TD management. Recent literature has proposed different indicator-based strategies for TD identification. However, there is limited empirical evidence to support that developers use these indicators to identify TD in practice. In this context, data from Q&amp;A websites, such as Stack Overflow (SO), have been extensively leveraged in recent studies to investigate software engineering practices from a developers' point of view. Goal. This paper seeks to investigate, from the point of view of practitioners, how developers commonly identify TD items in their projects. Method. We mined, curated, and selected a total of 140 TD-related discussions on SO, from which we performed both quantitative and qualitative analyses. Results. We found that SO's practitioners commonly discuss TD identification, revealing 29 different low-level indicators for recognizing TD items on code, infrastructure, architecture, and tests. We grouped low-level indicators based on their themes, producing an aggregated set of 13 distinct high-level indicators. We then classified all low- and high-level indicators into three different categories according to which type of debt each of them is meant to identify. Conclusions. We organize the empirical evidence on the low- and high-level indicators and their relationship to types of TD in a conceptual framework, which may assist developers and serve as guidance for future research, shedding new light on TD identification state-of-practice.},

A total of 352 valid samples are collected in mainland China while adopting structural equation model (SEM) approach. The empirical results indicate that both aspects of health knowledge sharing, namely health knowledge seeking and health knowledge contribution, have significantly positive influences on patient perceived value in OHCs. Moreover, the effect of health knowledge seeking on patient perceived value is stronger than the effect of health knowledge contribution. Besides this, the moderating effects of patient social capital on the relationship between health knowledge sharing and patient perceived value are significant. Specifically, patient social capital strengthens the relationship between health knowledge contribution and patient perceived value, while it weakens the relationship between health knowledge seeking and patient perceived value in OHCs.},

abstract = {Heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs) can learn from typed and relational graph data more effectively than conventional GNNs. With larger parameter spaces, HGNNs may require more training data, which is often scarce in real-world applications due to privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR). Federated graph learning (FGL) enables multiple clients to train a GNN collaboratively without sharing their local data. However, existing FGL methods mainly focus on homogeneous GNNs or knowledge graph embeddings; few have considered heterogeneous graphs and HGNNs. In federated heterogeneous graph learning, clients may have private graph schemas. Conventional FL/FGL methods attempting to define a global HGNN model would violate schema privacy. To address these challenges, we propose FedHGN, a novel and general FGL framework for HGNNs. Fed-HGN adopts schema-weight decoupling to enable schema-agnostic knowledge sharing and employs coefficients alignment to stabilize the training process and improve HGNN performance. With better privacy preservation, FedHGN consistently outperforms local training and conventional FL methods on three widely adopted heterogeneous graph datasets with varying client numbers.

abstract = {As modern social coding platforms such as GitHub and Stack Overflow become increasingly popular, their potential security risks increase as well (e.g., risky or malicious codes could be easily embedded and distributed). To enhance the social coding security, in this paper, we propose to automate cross-platform user identification between GitHub and Stack Overflow to combat the attackers who attempt to poison the modern software programming ecosystem. To solve this problem, an important insight brought by this work is to leverage social coding properties in addition to user attributes for cross-platform user identification. To depict users in GitHub and Stack Overflow (attached with attributed information), projects, questions and answers as well as the rich semantic relations among them, we first introduce an attributed heterogeneous information network (AHIN) for modeling. Then, we propose a novel AHIN representation learning model AHIN2Vec to efficiently learn node (i.e., user) representations in AHIN for cross-platform user identification. Comprehensive experiments on the data collections from GitHub and Stack Overflow are conducted to validate the effectiveness of our developed system iDev integrating our proposed method in cross-platform user identification by comparisons with other baselines.},

abstract = {Background Xu et al. used a deep neural network (DNN) technique to classify the degree of relatedness between two knowledge units (question-answer threads) on Stack Overflow. More recently, extending Xu et al.'s work, Fu and Menzies proposed a simpler classification technique based on a fine-tuned support vector machine (SVM) that achieves similar performance but in a much shorter time. Thus, they suggested that researchers need to compare their sophisticated methods against simpler alternatives.Aim The aim of this work is to replicate the previous studies and further investigate the validity of Fu and Menzies' claim by evaluating the DNN- and SVM-based approaches on a larger dataset. We also compare the effectiveness of these two approaches against SimBow, a lightweight SVM-based method that was previously used for general community question-answering.Method We (1) collect a large dataset containing knowledge units from Stack Overflow, (2) show the value of the new dataset addressing shortcomings of the original one, (3) re-evaluate both the DNN-and SVM-based approaches on the new dataset, and (4) compare the performance of the two approaches against that of SimBow.Results We find that: (1) there are several limitations in the original dataset used in the previous studies, (2) effectiveness of both Xu et al.'s and Fu and Menzies' approaches (as measured using F1-score) drop sharply on the new dataset, (3) similar to the previous finding, performance of SVM-based approaches (Fu and Menzies' approach and SimBow) are slightly better than the DNN-based approach, (4) contrary to the previous findings, Fu and Menzies' approach runs much slower than DNN-based approach on the larger dataset - its runtime grows sharply with increase in dataset size, and (5) SimBow outperforms both Xu et al. and Fu and Menzies' approaches in terms of runtime.Conclusion We conclude that, for this task, simpler approaches based on SVM performs adequately well. We also illustrate the challenges brought by the increased size of the dataset and show the benefit of a lightweight SVM-based approach for this task.},

Stack Overflow believes in the power of community editing, which means that one is able to edit questions without the changes going through peer review. Stack Overflow users may make edits to questions for a variety of reasons, among others, to improve the question and try to obtain more answers. However, to date the relationship between edit actions on questions and the number of answers that they collect is unknown. In this paper, we perform an empirical study on Stack Overflow to understand the relationship between edit actions and number of answers obtained in different dimensions from different attributes of the edited questions. We find that questions are more commonly edited by question owners, on bodies with relatively big changes before obtaining an accepted answer. However, edited questions that obtained more answers in a shorter time, were edited by other users rather than question owners, and their edits tended to be small, focused on titles and in adding addendums.},

abstract = {The prevalence of questions and answers on domain-specific Q&amp;A sites like Stack Overflow constitutes a core knowledge asset for software engineering domain. Although search engines can return a list of questions relevant to a user query of some technical question, the abundance of relevant posts and the sheer amount of information in them makes it difficult for developers to digest them and find the most needed answers to their questions. In this work, we aim to help developers who want to quickly capture the key points of several answer posts relevant to a technical question before they read the details of the posts. We formulate our task as a query-focused multi-answer-posts summarization task for a given technical question. Our proposed approach AnswerBot contains three main steps : 1) relevant question retrieval, 2) useful answer paragraph selection, 3) diverse answer summary generation. To evaluate our approach, we build a repository of 228,817 Java questions and their corresponding answers from Stack Overflow. We conduct user studies with 100 randomly selected Java questions (not in the question repository) to evaluate the quality of the answer summaries generated by our approach and the effectiveness of its relevant question retrieval and answer paragraph selection components. Our evaluation shows that answer summaries generated by our approach are relevant, useful and diverse to developers’ technical questions, and its components can effectively retrieve relevant questions and select salient answer paragraphs for summarization.},

Besides that, the lack of risk management could lead to problems such as delays, budget overruns, and even project termination, especially in distributed software development. In this paper, we address this topic in an industrial context. We implemented a simplified method to manage risks in distributed agile software development projects at Betabit company. The risk management approach proposed includes identifying, recording, and monitoring the risks faced by the company during its projects, enabling the creation of action plans to handle the risks. We assessed the acceptance of the method by applying the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) questionnaire and open questions among the professionals who used it. The research results showed that the model was well accepted, with 90.1\% of participants agreeing that it was useful in risk prevention and management. The benefits found were a broader view of projects, effective communication among teams, knowledge sharing, task clarification, and a structured approach to risk management. The challenging part is to learn how to use the method. Besides that, all respondents would recommend the proposed method to other companies, showing the potential of the method to manage risks in agile software projects.},

abstract = {Question \&amp; Answering (Q&amp;A) websites have become an essential knowledge-sharing platform. This platform provides knowledge-community services where users with common interests or expertise can form a knowledge community to collect and share QA documents. However, due to the massive amount of QAs, information overload can become a major problem. Consequently, a recommendation mechanism is needed to recommend QAs for communities of Q&amp;A websites. Existing studies did not investigate the recommendation mechanisms for knowledge collections in communities of Q&amp;A Websites. In this work, we propose a novel recommendation method to recommend related QAs for communities of Q&amp;A websites. The proposed method recommends QAs by considering the community members' reputations, the push scores and collection time of QAs, the complementary relationships between QAs and their relevance to the communities. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms other conventional methods, providing a more effective manner to recommend QA documents to knowledge communities.},

abstract = {Providing personalized online learning services has become a hot research topic. Online knowledge-sharing services represents a popular approach to enable learners to use fragmented spare time. User asks and answers questions in the platform, and the platform also recommends relevant questions to users based on their learning interested and context. However, in the big data era, information overload is a challenge, as both online learners and learning resources are embedded in data rich environment. Offering such web services requires an intelligent recommender system to automatically filter out irrelevant information, mine underling user preference, and distil latent information. Such a recommender system needs to be able to mine complex latent information, distinguish differences between users efficiently. In this study, we refine a recommender system of a prior work for web-based knowledge sharing. The system utilizes attention-based mechanisms and involves high-order feature interactions. Our experimental results show that the system outperforms known benchmarks and has great potential to be used for the web-based learning service.},

abstract = {An increasing number of Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) construction organizations are turning to knowledge management (KM) as a key to leverage their distinctive core competencies in their pursuit of competitive advantage. However, the construction industry is one of the most challenging environments in which managing people effectively in order to ensure that they contribute their knowledge to organisational success. The construction industry employs an extremely diverse range of people from a wide range of occupational cultures and background, including people in unskilled, craft, managerial, professional and administrative positions. Therefore, the industry increasingly depends on the employees' know-how. Knowledge sharing is one of the building blocks for an organisation's success and acts as a survival strategy in this knowledge era. Sharing project experience and knowledge among project staff will: reduce the cost of problem solving; and decrease the probability of repeat problems. In other words, sharing knowledge leads to faster response times which help firms meet construction requirements with lower operational costs. There is, however, knowledge sharing is an under-researched area in the KSA construction industry context, despite several policy transformations announced by the KSA Government. Thus, the main aim of this research was to explore the drivers for sharing knowledge in the KSA construction industry. The findings are in the main, based on semi-structured interviews with 44 professionals from 30 construction organizations. The data analysis revealed that seven key drivers that have fueled the need for sharing knowledge. They are: to integrate knowledge of different teams through interaction, to set physical and social environment in the organisation for boosting production, to measure the methods and techniques for implementing knowledge sharing strategies, to transfer knowledge in different platforms, to retain knowledge, to reflect on the self-understandings and to create organisational communities for sharing ideas. The paper conclude that there is ample scope for empirical studies to explore and document the issues of organisational care and its impact on the knowledge sharing culture of KSA construction organizations. Further it noted that, managing knowledge is an integrated and complex process. More effective knowledge-sharing within and across construction organizations is required. Therefore, the KSA professional institutions and construction industry should support and participate in the work of knowledge-sharing groups to address perceived risks and opportunities from new technologies (e.g. BIM, mobile applications) and processes (e.g. sustainability issues).},

It affects gig workers' limited ability and knowledge to accomplish projects and reduce their performance. This study proposed a knowledge-sharing model to articulate insightful knowledge from scattered tacit and explicit knowledge by keep personal data and copyright. It performed Soft System Methodology to facilitate conceptualization process from founded problem until strategies formulation. It generated artifacts to clarify problems and elaborates their solutions. By decomposing the problems into fishbone analysis, this study has identified who are the involved stakeholders and how the knowledge management should run. It became root cause as baseline to conceptualize a knowledge sharing model among gig workers. As the result, this study delivered a knowledge sharing model which relied on point system to engage gig workers' participation to externalize their knowledge in knowledge repository and expert should validate them before knowledge storing. To achieve more qualified model, this study relied on validation by representative gig workers and platform applications. This model contributes to mediate knowledge circulation among gig workers by encourage their extrinsic motivation. Hence, it can deliver innovative solution to enhance digital business on modern society through gig worker empowerment.},

abstract = {In recent years, community Q&amp;A websites have attracted many users and have become reliable sources among experts from various fields. These platforms have specific rules to maintain their content quality in addition to general user agreements. Due to the vast expanse of these systems in terms of the number of users and posts, manual checking and verification of new contents by the administrators and official moderators are not feasible, and these systems require scalable solutions. In major Q&amp;A networks, the current strategy is to use crowdsourcing with reliance on reporting systems. This strategy has serious problems, including the slow handling of violations, the loss of new and experienced users’ time, the low quality of user reports, and discouraging feedback to new users. While this is a great opportunity to utilize machine-learning approaches to provide automated recommender systems and classification models, there are specific non-functional requirements or aspects related to these software systems that need to be introduced and incorporated in the design of a new system. In this short paper, I pinpoint three key aspects: (1) Any good approach should consider specific attributes and features related to context, (2) Automated mechanisms should be proposed according to the highly evolving content of Q&amp;A websites, and (3) Decisions are best to accompany clear and justifiable explanations. Furthermore, a technical conceptual model is proposed by considering these aspects and related approaches. This is a part of a research project where the final goal is to provide accurate, adaptable, efficient, and explainable solutions for automating moderation actions in Q&amp;A websites.},

abstract = {Software developers are increasingly having conversations about software development via online chat services. Many of those chat communications contain valuable information, such as code descriptions, good programming practices, and causes of common errors/exceptions. However, the nature of chat community content is transient, as opposed to the archival nature of other developer communications such as email, bug reports and Q&amp;A forums. As a result, important information and advice are lost over time.The focus of this dissertation is Extracting Archival Information from Software-Related Chats, specifically to (1) automatically identify conversations that contain archival-quality information, (2) accurately reduce the granularity of the information reported as archival information, and (3) conduct a case study to investigate how archival quality information extracted from chats compare to related posts in Q&amp;A forums. Archiving knowledge from developer chats could be used potentially in several applications such as: creating a new archival mechanism available to a given chat community, augmenting Q&amp;A forums, or facilitating the mining of specific information and improving software maintenance tools.},

abstract = {Online question and answer (Q&amp;A) sites, which are platforms for users to post and answer questions on a wide range of topics, are becoming large repositories of valuable knowledge and important to societies. In order to sustain success, Q&amp;A sites face the challenges of ensuring content quality and encouraging user contributions. This paper examines a particular design decision in Q&amp;A sites-allowing Wikipedia-like collaborative editing on questions and answers, and explores its beneficial effects on content quality and potential detrimental effects on users' contributions. By examining five years' archival data of Stack Overflow, we found that the benefits of collaborative editing outweigh its risks. For example, each substantive edit from other users can increase the number of positive votes by 181\% for the questions and 119\% for the answers. On the other hand, each edit only decreases askers and answerers' subsequent contributions by no more than 5\%. This work has implications for understanding and designing large-scale social computing systems.},

abstract = {Due to lack of resources (funds, social influence, user feedback etc.), small companies, in particular, start-up companies, almost exclusively must rely on their own expertise with regards to technological innovation. Therefore, it could be beneficial for them to analyze big companies or competitors' products in order to get a better understanding of what users think about them. The core idea of my research project is to use opinions voiced by users about strengths and weaknesses of competitors' products to improve the understanding of actual user needs and thus help focus the requirements definition of the small, especially start-up company's own product. In order to lower the cost of analysis, we investigate how user needs can be distilled from online open sources. Since there are different types of online open sources, as a starting point of our current stage of research, we focused on one type of online open sources - question and answer (Q&amp;A) sites such as Stack Overflow. As a showcase, we used the IDE project Eclipse. In our exploratory study, we analyzed the popularity of Eclipse, the amount of questions asked, the amount of questions asked that received an accepted answer, as well as the contents of questions asked about Eclipse. We also analyzed the emotional polarity of the posted questions. We found that the Stack Overflow timely updates, and the emotions reflected is more objective according to the result shown by sentiment analysis that 82\% questions show neutral emotion.},

This paper studies product configuration ontologies and presents a meta-model of concepts and their relationships that are used in those ontologies. The proposed meta-model consists of a generalisation hierarchy of configuration types, the compositional structure of a configurable product, the generalisation hierarchy of a component, and constraint types. The meta-model has been designed with the aim of first understanding the current state of product configuration ontologies and then extending it for integrating new concepts.},

Existing techniques are limited to library dependency specifications declared in PyPI. Therefore, these techniques cannot detect version issues due to undocumented version constraints or issues involving hardware drivers or OS. To address this challenge, we propose to leverage the abundant discussions of DL version issues from Stack Overflow to facilitate version incompatibility detection. We reformulate the problem of knowledge extraction as a Question-Answering (QA) problem and use a pre-trained QA model to extract version compatibility knowledge from online discussions. The extracted knowledge is further consolidated into a weighted knowledge graph to detect potential version incompatibilities when reusing a DL project. Our evaluation results show that (1) our approach can accurately extract version knowledge with 84\% accuracy, and (2) our approach can accurately identify 65\% of known version issues in 10 popular DL projects with a high precision (92\%), while two state-of-the-art approaches can only detect 29\% and 6\% of these issues with 33\% and 17\% precision respectively.},

A clinical decision support system (CDSS) helps medical experts in their daily work and supports them in effective decision-making. The huge amount of medical information and the complex correlation between the risk factors and the level of risk for suicidal behavior makes the representation of data is challenging. Therefore, this paper proposes an ontology-based modeling to classify an individual with at-risk of suicidal behavior for effective clinical decision support system. The case study is conducted to evaluate the ontology model and provides a general approach to knowledge sharing and reusing knowledge for suicide risk prevention and management. The finding shows that the ontology model can be used as a knowledge base for classification, and it is suitable to capture medical knowledge, detailed concepts, and relationships in a formal way using Web Ontology Language (OWL). The results of the proposed ontology model in terms of accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity are 83\%, 84\%, and 82\% respectively.},

We observe in Stack Overflow a huge number of recurring questions, 1,632,590, despite mechanisms having been put into place to prevent these recurring questions. Recurring questions imply developers are facing similar issues in their source code. However, limitations exist in the QA sites. Developers need to visit them frequently and/or should be familiar with all the content to take advantage of the crowd's knowledge. Due to the large and rapid growth of QA data, it is difficult, if not impossible for developers to catch up. To address these limitations, we propose mining the QA site, Stack Overflow, to leverage the huge mass of crowd knowledge to help developers debug their code. Our approach reveals 189 warnings and 171 (90.5\%) of them are confirmed by developers from eight high-quality and well-maintained projects. Developers appreciate these findings because the crowd provides solutions and comprehensive explanations to the issues. We compared the confirmed bugs with three popular static analysis tools (FindBugs, JLint and PMD). Of the 171 bugs identified by our approach, only FindBugs detected six of them whereas JLint and PMD detected none.},

abstract = {Software developers are increasingly using cloud-based services that provide machine learning capabilities to implement ‘intelligent’ features. Studies show that incorporating machine learning into an application increases technical debt, creates data dependencies, and introduces uncertainty due to their non-deterministic behaviour. We know very little about the emotional state of software developers who have to deal with such issues; and the impacts on productivity. This paper presents a preliminary effort to better understand the emotions of developers when experiencing issues with these services with the wider goal of discovering potential service improvements. We conducted a landscape analysis of emotions found in 1,425 Stack Overflow questions about a specific and mature subset of these cloud-based services, namely those that provide computer vision techniques. To speed up the emotion identification process, we trialled an automatic approach using a pre-trained emotion classifier that was specifically trained on Stack Overflow content, EmoTxt, and manually verified its classification results. We found that the identified emotions vary for different types of questions, and a discrepancy exists between automatic and manual emotion analysis due to subjectivity.},

Consequently, an automated network management system that can efficiently predict and detect anomalies is needed. In this paper, we propose, RCAD, a novel distributed architecture for detecting anomalies in network data forwarding latency in an unsupervised fashion. RCAD employs the hierarchical temporal memory (HTM) algorithm for the online detection of anomalies. It also involves a collaborative distributed learning module that facilitates knowledge sharing across the system. We implement and evaluate RCAD on real world measurements from a commercial mobile network. RCAD achieves over 0.7 F-1 score significantly outperforming current state-of-the-art methods.},

abstract = {Duplicate questions on Stack Overflow are questions that are flagged as being conceptually equivalent to a previously posted question. Stack Overflow suggests that duplicate questions should not be discussed by users, but rather that attention should be redirected to their previously posted counterparts. Roughly 53\% of closed Stack Overflow posts are closed due to duplication. Despite their supposed overlapping content, user activity suggests duplicates may generate additional or superior answers. Approximately 9\% of duplicates receive more views than their original counterparts despite being closed.In this paper, we analyze duplicate questions from two perspectives. First, we analyze the experience of those who post duplicates using activity and reputation-based heuristics. Second, we compare the content of duplicates both in terms of their questions and answers to determine the degree of similarity between each duplicate pair. Through analysis of the MSR challenge dataset, we find that although duplicate questions are more likely to be created by inexperienced users, they often receive dissimilar answers to their original counterparts. Indeed, supplementary textual analysis using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques suggests duplicate questions provide additional information about the underlying concepts being discussed. We recommend that the Stack Overflow's duplication policy be revised to account for the benefits that leaving duplicate questions open may have for the developer community.},

abstract = {Using online Q&amp;A forums, such as Stack Overflow (SO), for guidance to resolve program bugs, among other development issues, is commonplace in modern software development practice. Runtime exceptions (RE) is one such important class of bugs that is actively discussed on SO. In this work we present a technique and prototype tool called MAESTRO that can automatically recommend an SO post that is most relevant to a given Java RE in a developer's code. MAESTRO compares the exception-generating program scenario in the developer's code with that discussed in an SO post and returns the post with the closest match. To extract and compare the exception scenario effectively, MAESTRO first uses the answer code snippets in a post to implicate a subset of lines in the post's question code snippet as responsible for the exception and then compares these lines with the developer's code in terms of their respective Abstract Program Graph (APG) representations. The APG is a simplified and abstracted derivative of an abstract syntax tree, proposed in this work, that allows an effective comparison of the functionality embodied in the high-level program structure, while discarding many of the low-level syntactic or semantic differences. We evaluate MAESTRO on a benchmark of 78 instances of Java REs extracted from the top 500 Java projects on GitHub and show that MAESTRO can return either a highly relevant or somewhat relevant SO post corresponding to the exception instance in 71\% of the cases, compared to relevant posts returned in only 8\% - 44\% instances, by four competitor tools based on state-of-the-art techniques. We also conduct a user experience study of MAESTRO with 10 Java developers, where the participants judge MAESTRO reporting a highly relevant or somewhat relevant post in 80\% of the instances. In some cases the post is judged to be even better than the one manually found by the participant.},

abstract = {Despite the apparent benefits of modern social coding paradigm such as Stack Overflow, its potential security risks have been largely overlooked (e.g., insecure codes could be easily embedded and distributed). To address this imminent issue, in this paper, we bring a significant insight to leverage both social coding properties and code content for automatic detection of insecure code snippets in Stack Overflow. To determine if the given code snippets are insecure, we not only analyze the code content, but also utilize various kinds of relations among users, badges, questions, answers and code snippets in Stack Overflow. To model the rich semantic relationships, we first introduce a structured heterogeneous information network (HIN) for representation and then use meta-path based approach to incorporate higher-level semantics to build up relatedness over code snippets. Later, we propose a novel hierarchical attention-based sequence learning model named CodeHin2Vec to seamlessly integrate node (i.e., code snippet) content with HIN-based relations for representation learning. After that, a classifier is built for insecure code snippet detection. Integrating our proposed method, an intelligent system named iTrustSO is accordingly developed to address the code security issues in modern software coding platforms. Comprehensive experiments on the data collections from Stack Overflow are conducted to validate the effectiveness of our developed system iTrustSO by comparisons with alternative methods.},

abstract = {Badges are endemic to online interaction sites, from Question and Answer (Q&amp;A) websites to ride sharing, as systems for rewarding participants for their contributions. This paper studies how badge design affects people's contributions and behavior over time. Past work has shown that badges "steer'' people's behavior toward substantially increasing the amount of contributions before obtaining the badge, and immediately decreasing their contributions thereafter, returning to their baseline contribution levels. In contrast, we find that the steering effect depends on the type of user, as modeled by the rate and intensity of the user's contributions. We use these measures to distinguish between different groups of user activity, including users who are not affected by the badge system despite being significant contributors to the site. We provide a predictive model of how users change their activity group over the course of their lifetime in the system. We demonstrate our approach empirically in three different Q&amp;A sites on Stack Exchange with hundreds of thousands of users, and we discuss the implications for system designers.},

abstract = {The collaboration of financial institutes against fraudsters is a promising path for reducing resource investments and increasing coverage. Yet, such collaboration is held back by two somewhat conflicting challenges: effective knowledge sharing and limiting leakage of private information. While the censorship of private information is likely to reduce knowledge sharing effectiveness, the generalization of private information to a desired degree can potentially allow, on one hand, to limit the leakage, and on the other hand, to reveal some properties of the private information that can be beneficial for sharing.In this demo we present a system that allows knowledge sharing via effective adaptation of fraud detection rules while preserving privacy. The system uses taxonomies to generalize concrete values appearing in fraud detection rules to higher level concepts which conform to some privacy/utility requirements set by the owner. Our demonstration will engage the CIKM'18 audience by showing that private information can be abstracted to enforce privacy while maintaining its usage by (partially) trusted allies.},

Managing with respect to TPs, so that teachers' accumulated experience may be identified, shared and reused, can offer significant benefits, including the introduction of teaching innovations which lead to improvements in overall teaching quality, and the enhancement of academics' professional development efforts. In this paper, we aim to define a teaching practices management framework (TPMF) for enhancing the sharing processes relating to TPs. The development of this TPMF has been informed by semi-structured interviews conducted with 22 instructors working in two universities in Saudi Arabia; these interviews were undertaken in order to better understand the academics' actual knowledge sharing behaviors in relation to TPs and also to gain a systemic and overall perspective of current knowledge sharing approaches. An inductive coding approach was employed to help the researcher extract themes which were mentioned by the interviewees. It is believed that this framework may well be of great assistance to higher education sector institutions.},

abstract = {With the development of modern internet techniques, Cross-Domain Recommendation (CDR) systems have been widely exploited for tackling the data-sparsity problem. Meanwhile most current CDR models assume that user-item interactions are accessible across different domains. However, such knowledge sharing process will break the privacy protection policy. In this paper, we focus on the Privacy-Preserving Multi-Domain Recommendation problem (PPMDR). The problem is challenging since different domains are sparse and heterogeneous with the privacy protection. To tackle the above issues, we propose Federated Probabilistic Preference Distribution Modelling (FPPDM). FPPDM includes two main components, i.e., local domain modelling component and global server aggregation component with federated learning strategy. The local domain modelling component aims to exploit user/item preference distributions using the rating information in the corresponding domain. The global server aggregation component is set to combine user characteristics across domains. To better extract semantic neighbors information among the users, we further provide compactness co-clustering strategy in FPPDM++ to cluster the users with similar characteristics. Our empirical studies on benchmark datasets demonstrate that FPPDM/FPPDM++ significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art models.},

abstract = {Community Question Answering (CQA) provides platforms for users with various background to obtain information and share knowledge. In the recent years, with the rapid development of such online platforms, an enormous amount of archive data has accumulated which makes it more and more difficult for users to identify desirable answers. Therefore, answer selection becomes a very important subtask in Community Question Answering. A posted question often consists of two parts: a question subject with summarization of users’ intention, and a question body clarifying the subject with more details. Most of the existing answer selection techniques often roughly concatenate these two parts, so that they cause excessive noises besides useful information to questions, inevitably reducing the performance of answer selection approaches. In this paper, we propose AMQAN, an adaptive multi-attention question-answer network with embeddings at different levels, which makes comprehensive use of semantic information in questions and answers, and alleviates the noise issue at the same time. To evaluate our proposed approach, we implement experiments on two datasets, SemEval 2015 and SemEval 2017. Experiment results show that AMQAN outperforms all existing models on two standard CQA datasets.},

abstract = {Developers often resort to online Q&amp;A forums such as Stack Overflow (SO) for filling their programming needs. Although code examples on those forums are good starting points, they are often incomplete and inadequate for developers' local program contexts; adaptation of those examples is necessary to integrate them to production code. As a consequence, the process of adapting online code examples is done over and over again, by multiple developers independently. Our work extensively studies these adaptations and variations, serving as the basis for a tool that helps integrate these online code examples in a target context in an interactive manner.We perform a large-scale empirical study about the nature and extent of adaptations and variations of SO snippets. We construct a comprehensive dataset linking SO posts to GitHub counterparts based on clone detection, time stamp analysis, and explicit URL references. We then qualitatively inspect 400 SO examples and their GitHub counterparts and develop a taxonomy of 24 adaptation types. Using this taxonomy, we build an automated adaptation analysis technique on top of GumTree to classify the entire dataset into these types. We build a Chrome extension called ExampleStack that automatically lifts an adaptation-aware template from each SO example and its GitHub counterparts to identify hot spots where most changes happen. A user study with sixteen programmers shows that seeing the commonalities and variations in similar GitHub counterparts increases their confidence about the given SO example, and helps them grasp a more comprehensive view about how to reuse the example differently and avoid common pitfalls.},

abstract = {CTR and CVR are critical factors in personalized applications, and many methods jointly estimate them via multi-task learning to alleviate the ultra-sparsity of conversion behaviors. However, it is still difficult to predict CVR accurately and robustly due to the limited and even biased knowledge extracted by the single model tower optimized on insufficient conversion samples. In this paper, we propose a task adaptive multi-learner (TAML) framework for joint CTR and CVR prediction. We design a hierarchical task adaptive knowledge representation module with different experts to capture knowledge in different granularities, which can effectively exploit the commonalities between CTR and CVR estimation tasks meanwhile keeping their unique characteristics. We apply multiple learners to extract data knowledge from various views and fuse their predictions to obtain accurate and robust scores. To facilitate knowledge sharing across learners, we further perform self-distillation that uses the fused scores to teach different learners. Thorough offline and online experiments show the superiority of TAML in different Ad ranking tasks, and we have deployed it in Huawei’s online advertising platform to serve the main traffic.},

abstract = {Graph representation learning via Contrastive Learning (GCL) has drawn considerable attention recently. Efforts are mainly focused on gathering more global information via contrasting on a single high-level graph view, which, however, underestimates the inherent complex and hierarchical properties in many real-world networks, leading to sub-optimal embeddings. To incorporate these properties of a complex graph, we propose Cross-Scale Contrastive Graph Knowledge Synergy (CGKS), a generic feature learning framework, to advance graph contrastive learning with enhanced generalization ability and the awareness of latent anatomies. Specifically, to maintain the hierarchical information, we create a so-call graph pyramid (GP) consisting of coarse-grained graph views. Each graph view is obtained via the careful design topology-aware graph coarsening layer that extends the Laplacian Eigenmaps with negative sampling. To promote cross-scale information sharing and knowledge interactions among GP, we propose a novel joint optimization formula that contains a pairwise contrastive loss between any two coarse-grained graph views. This synergy loss not only promotes knowledge sharing that yields informative representations, but also stabilizes the training process. Experiments on various downstream tasks demonstrate the substantial improvements of the proposed method over its counterparts.},

This paper presents an empirical study on the prevalence and severity of API misuse on Stack Overflow. To reduce manual assessment effort, we design ExampleCheck, an API usage mining framework that extracts patterns from over 380K Java repositories on GitHub and subsequently reports potential API usage violations in Stack Overflow posts. We analyze 217,818 Stack Overflow posts using ExampleCheck and find that 31\% may have potential API usage violations that could produce unexpected behavior such as program crashes and resource leaks. Such API misuse is caused by three main reasons---missing control constructs, missing or incorrect order of API calls, and incorrect guard conditions. Even the posts that are accepted as correct answers or upvoted by other programmers are not necessarily more reliable than other posts in terms of API misuse. This study result calls for a new approach to augment Stack Overflow with alternative API usage details that are not typically shown in curated examples.},

abstract = {API usage directives in official API documentation describe the contracts, constraints and guidelines for using APIs in natural language. Through the investigation of API misuse scenarios on Stack Overflow, we identify three barriers that hinder the understanding of the API usage directives, i.e., lack of specific usage context, indirect relationships to cooperative APIs, and confusing APIs with subtle differences. To overcome these barriers, we develop a text mining approach to discover the crowdsourced API misuse scenarios on Stack Overflow and extract from these scenarios erroneous code examples and patches, as well as related API and confusing APIs to construct demystification reports to help developers understand the official API usage directives described in natural language. We apply our approach to API usage directives in official Android API documentation and android-tagged discussion threads on Stack Overflow. We extract 159,116 API misuse scenarios for 23,969 API usage directives of 3138 classes and 7471 methods, from which we generate the demystification reports. Our manual examination confirms that the extracted information in the generated demystification reports are of high accuracy. By a user study of 14 developers on 8 API-misuse related error scenarios, we show that our demystification reports help developer understand and debug API-misuse related program errors faster and more accurately, compared with reading only plain API usage-directive sentences.},

abstract = {Animal face alignment is challenging due to large intra- and inter-species variations and a scarcity of labeled data. Existing studies circumvent this problem by directly finetuning a human face alignment model or focusing on animal-specific face alignment~(e.g., horse, sheep). In this paper, we propose Cross-Species Knowledge Transfer, Meta-CSKT, for animal face alignment, which consists of a base network and an adaptation network. Two networks continuously complement each other through the bi-directional cross-species knowledge transfer. This is motivated by observing knowledge sharing among animals. Meta-CSKT uses a circuit feedback mechanism to improve the base network with the cognitive differences of the adaptation network between few-shot labeled and large-scale unlabeled data. In addition, we propose a positive example mining method to identify positives, semi-hard positives, and hard negatives in unlabeled data to mitigate the scarcity of labeled data and facilitate Meta-CSKT learning. Experiments show that Meta-CSKT outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a large margin on the horse facial keypoint dataset and Japanese Macaque Species dataset, while achieving comparable results to state-of-the-art methods on large-scale labeled AnimalWeb~(e.g., 18K), using only a few labeled images~(e.g., 40)1.},

abstract = {Dynamic scene graphs have become a powerful tool for higher-level visual understanding tasks, and the interest in dynamic scene graph generation (dynamic SGG) is grown over time. Recently, numbers of existing methods achieve significant progress in dynamic SGG by capturing temporal information with transformer or recurrent network structures. However, most existing methods only focus on predicting the head predicates, which ignore the long-tail phenomenon, thus the tail predicates are hard to be recognized. In this paper, we propose a novel method named Iterative Learning with Extra and Inner Knowledge (I2LEK) to address the long-tail problem in dynamic SGG. The extra knowledge is obtained from commonsense, while inner knowledge is defined as the temporal evolution patterns of visual relationships. Specifically, we introduce extra knowledge to enrich the representations of predicates in the spatial dimension and adopt inner knowledge to implement knowledge sharing in the temporal dimension. With enriched representations and shared knowledge, I2LEK can accurately predict both the tail and head predicates. Moreover, an iterative learning strategy is proposed to fuse the extra knowledge, inner knowledge, and spatial-temporal context contained in videos, which further enhances the model's understanding of visual relationships. Our experimental results on the public Action Genome dataset demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance.},

year = {2023},
publisher = {JMLR.org},
abstract = {Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) has demonstrated its effectiveness in learning collaboration, but it often struggles with low-quality reward signals and high non-stationarity. In contrast, Evolutionary Algorithm (EA) has shown better convergence, robustness, and signal quality insensitivity. This paper introduces a hybrid framework, Representation Asymmetry and Collaboration Evolution (RACE), which combines EA and MARL for efficient collaboration. RACE maintains a MARL team and a population of EA teams. To enable efficient knowledge sharing and policy exploration, RACE decomposes the policies of different teams controlling the same agent into a shared nonlinear observation representation encoder and individual linear policy representations. To address the partial observation issue, we introduce Value-Aware Mutual Information Maximization to enhance the shared representation with useful information about superior global states. To facilitate coordination, EA evolves the population using novel agent-level crossover and mutation operators, offering diverse experiences for MARL. Concurrently, MARL optimizes its policies and injects them into the population for evolution. The experiments on challenging continuous and discrete tasks demonstrate that RACE significantly improves the basic algorithms, consistently outperforming other algorithms.

abstract = {Computer Science teaching materials are biased towards concepts and theoretical aspects. One may consider it difficult to relate concepts to concrete problems. Consequently, it increases the chances of a student not recognizing the relevance of the subject, becoming unmotivated and unprepared to solve practical problems or coping with workplace needs after college. This paper shows the use of social media data as an alternative to minimize the skill gap between what the student learns in college and the skills required in the workplace. The proposed strategy consists of extracting topics from Stack Overflow questions to identify concepts generally unknown or misunderstood and concepts that their practical application represents a challenge. The concepts covered in Stack Overflow questions provide strong cues about how professors and instructors can improve teaching material with useful content for their students, as well as increase their motivation -- since the teaching material becomes clearly related to practical issues in Computer Science. We show, by an example, how to use the proposed strategy to improve teaching material from the generated topics. Also, we demonstrate that the application of topic modeling in Stack Overflow content is promising as a professor support tool to enhance teaching material relevance in Computer Science courses and diminish the college-workplace skill gap.},

abstract = {Question and Answer (Q&amp;A) services, such as Stack Overflow, rely on a community of programmers who post questions, provide and rate answers, to create what is termed "crowd knowledge". As a consequence, these services archive voluminous and potentially useful information to help developers to solve programming-specific issues. Programmers tap into this crowd knowledge through web browsers. This requires them to step out of their integrated development environments (IDE), formulate a query, inspect the returned results and manually port the solution back to the IDE. We present an integrated and largely automated approach to assist programmers who want to leverage the crowd knowledge of Q&amp;A services. We give a form to our approach by implementing Seahawk, an Eclipse plugin. Seahawk automatically formulates queries from the current context in the IDE, and presents a ranked and interactive list of results. Seahawk lets users identify individual discussion pieces and import code samples through simple drag \&amp; drop. Users can also link Stack Overflow discussions and source code persistently. We performed an evaluation of Seahawk, with promising results.},

abstract = {Skin lesion recognition using deep learning has made remarkable progress, and there is an increasing need for deploying these systems in real-world scenarios. However, recent research has revealed that deep neural networks for skin lesion recognition may overly depend on disease-irrelevant image artifacts (i.e.&nbsp;dark corners, dense hairs), leading to poor generalization in unseen environments. To address this issue, we propose a novel domain generalization method called EPVT, which involves embedding prompts into the vision transformer to collaboratively learn knowledge from diverse domains. Concretely, EPVT leverages a set of domain prompts, each of which plays as a domain expert, to capture domain-specific knowledge; and a shared prompt for general knowledge over the entire dataset. To facilitate knowledge sharing and the interaction of different prompts, we introduce a domain prompt generator that enables low-rank multiplicative updates between domain prompts and the shared prompt. A domain mixup strategy is additionally devised to reduce the co-occurring artifacts in each domain, which allows for more flexible decision margins and mitigates the issue of incorrectly assigned domain labels. Experiments on four out-of-distribution datasets and six different biased ISIC datasets demonstrate the superior generalization ability of EPVT in skin lesion recognition across various environments.

Do they deteriorate the learning capability of the DL based systems? To answer these questions, we studied 321 Stack Overflow posts based on a published dataset. In this study, we built a classification scheme to analyze how bug-fixes changed the robustness of the DL model and found that most of the bug-fixes can increase the robustness. We also found evidence of bug-fixing that decrease the robustness. Our preliminary result suggests that 12.5\% and 2.4\% of the bug-fixes in Stack Overflow posts caused the increase and the decrease of the robustness of DL models, respectively.},

Unfortunately, the majority of knowledge-sharing systems are designed for domain experts. Making it extremely difficult for a non-expert to understand the content and explore the graph. A solution to this issue is using a machine-assisted knowledge graph exploration approach. This research introduces a knowledge exploration method to systematically and efficiently navigate a knowledge graph. First, we modeled the knowledge graphs based on the existing common schema. Second, we created a search tree technique to navigate the knowledge graph efficiently. The algorithm solves the problem by determining the path of knowledge graph exploration. We evaluated the method using a knowledge base of morphological characteristics of Capsicum. The goal of graph exploration was to identify a Capsicum species correctly. As a result, the proposed mechanism can achieve high precision, even when the search’s starting point is unknown beforehand.},

To alleviate the above issue, a zoning search and transfer learning- based multimodal multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (called ZSTL-MMOEA) is proposed in the present study. In the ZSTL-MMOEA, the decision space is divided into many subspaces and the transfer learning is used to realize knowledge sharing between two the most similar subspaces. The ZSTL-MMOEA is compared with five recently proposed multimodal multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MMOE- As) on 22 test functions.

Knowledge sharing leads to applied practice including tool use, but that aspect is secondary. The Mentorspace increases the value of engineering education by tying applied practice to local needs and opportunities for graduates within the community. To extend this value in a broad sense, the Mentorspace brings in business and community developers to add local economic and social factors to the engineering curriculum. Success of the space is measured through academic and personal accomplishment, and contribution to community and social development. Long term mentoring by all participants regardless of age or social position is a cornerstone of the Mentorspace.},

Transformers have recently demonstrated impressive performance on a multitude of supervised learning tasks. Surprisingly, we show Vision Transformers perform significantly worse than Convolutional Neural Networks when only a small set of labeled data is available. Inspired by this observation, we introduce a joint semi-supervised learning framework, Semiformer, which contains a transformer stream, a convolutional stream and a carefully designed fusion module for knowledge sharing between these streams. The convolutional stream is trained on limited labeled data and further used to generate pseudo labels to supervise the training of the transformer stream on unlabeled data. Extensive experiments on ImageNet demonstrate that Semiformer achieves 75.5\% top-1 accuracy, outperforming the state-of-the-art by a clear margin. In addition, we show, among other things, Semiformer is a general framework that is compatible with most modern transformer and convolutional neural architectures. Code is available at .},

abstract = {Community Question Answering (CQA) websites are valuable knowledge repositories where individuals exchange information by asking and answering questions. With an ever-increasing number of questions and high in-flow and out-flow of users in these communities, a key challenge is to design effective strategies for recommending experts for new questions. This requires robust approaches that facilitate modeling users’ expertise given their changing interests and sparse historical data, at the same time being computationally less expensive for periodic updates. In this paper, we propose a simple graph diffusion-based expert recommendation model for CQA, that can outperform state-of-the-art convolutional neural network and transformers-based deep learning representatives and collaborative models. Our proposed method learns users’ expertise in the context of both semantic and temporal information to capture their changing interests and activity levels with time. Experiments on six real-world datasets from the Stack Exchange network demonstrate that our approach outperforms competitive baseline methods. Further, experiments on cold-start users (users with a limited historical record) show our model achieves an average of 50\% performance gain compared to the best baseline method.},

abstract = {In this paper, we proposed a novel framework which uses user interests inferred from activities (a.k.a., activity interests) in multiple social collaborative platforms to predict users' platform activities. Included in the framework are two prediction approaches: (i) direct platform activity prediction, which predicts a user's activities in a platform using his or her activity interests from the same platform (e.g., predict if a user answers a given Stack Overflow question using the user's interests inferred from his or her prior answer and favorite activities in Stack Overflow), and (ii) cross-platform activity prediction, which predicts a user's activities in a platform using his or her activity interests from another platform (e.g., predict if a user answers a given Stack Overflow question using the user's interests inferred from his or her fork and watch activities in GitHub). To evaluate our proposed method, we conduct prediction experiments on two widely used social collaborative platforms in the software development community: GitHub and Stack Overflow. Our experiments show that combining both direct and cross platform activity prediction approaches yield the best accuracies for predicting user activities in GitHub (AUC=0.75) and Stack Overflow (AUC=0.89).},

Most prior studies mainly focused on the goals expressed in the questions, but not on how responders' expectations and responses are influenced by the goal-expressions. To fill the gap, this research proposes the use of framing theory to understand how different expressions of goals influence responses. Cues of questions were used to identify goal-frames in CQA questions. Social network analysis was used to construct response networks whose nodes represent postings and connections represent responses. Our results reveal that goal-frames with high complexity, high specificity, and rewards tend to increase the centrality of questions. In contrast, low complexity and low specificity tend to generate extensive conversations. Implications for both researchers and practitioners are discussed in the final section.},

abstract = {Driving under the influence (DUI) is one of the main causes of traffic accidents, often leading to severe life and property losses. Setting up sobriety checkpoints on certain roads is the most commonly used practice to identify DUI-drivers in many countries worldwide. However, setting up checkpoints according to the police's experiences may not be effective for ignoring the strategic interactions between the police and DUI-drivers, particularly when inspecting resources are limited. To remedy this situation, we adapt the classic Stackelberg security game (SSG) to a new SSG-DUI game to describe the strategic interactions in catching DUI-drivers. SSG-DUI features drivers' bounded rationality and social knowledge sharing among them, thus realizing improved real-world fidelity. With SSG-DUI, we propose OPRADI, a systematic approach for advising better strategies in setting up checkpoints. We perform extensive experiments to evaluate it in simulated environments, contexts reconstructed from real-world data, and preliminary deployments, in collaborating with a Chinese city's police bureau. The results reveal its effectiveness in improving police's real-world operations, thus having significant practical potentials.},

abstract = {Technical questions and answers (Q&amp;A) websites accumulate a significant amount of knowledge from users. Developers are especially active on these Q&amp;A websites, since developers are constantly facing new development challenges that require help from other experts. Over the years, Q&amp;A website designers have derived several incentive systems (e.g., gamification) to encourage users to answer questions that are posted by others. However, the current incentive systems primarily focus on the quantity and quality of the answers instead of encouraging the rapid answering of questions. Improving the speed of getting an answer can significantly improve the user experience and increase user engagement on such Q&amp;A websites.In this paper [1], we study the factors for fast answers on such Q&amp;A websites. Our goal is to explore how one may improve the current incentive systems to motivate fast answering of questions. We use a logistic regression model to analyze 46 factors along four dimensions (i.e., question, asker, answer, and answerer dimension) in order to understand the relationship between the studied factors and the needed time to get an accepted answer. The question dimension calculates various textual and readability features of a question, as well as the popularity and difficulty of the question's tags. The asker dimension calculates the reputation of an asker and his/her historical tendency to get answers. The answer dimension computes textual features from the text of the accepted answer. The answerer dimension computes the historical activity level of the answerer who answered the question. We conduct our study on the four most popular (i.e., with the most questions) Q&amp;A Stack Exchange websites: Stack Overflow, Mathematics, Ask Ubuntu, and Superuser. We find that i) factors in the answerer dimension have the strongest effect on the needed time to get an accepted answer, after controlling for other factors; ii) the current incentive system does not recognize non-frequent answerers who often answer questions which frequent answerers are not able to answer well. Such questions that are answered by non-frequent answerers are as important as those that are answered by frequent answerers; iii) the current incentive system motivates frequent answerers well, but such frequent answerers tend to answer short questions.Our findings suggest that the designers of Q&amp;A website should improve their incentive systems to motivate non-frequent answerers to be more active and to answer questions faster, in order to shorten the waiting time for an answer (especially for questions that require specific knowledge that frequent answerers might not possess). In addition, the question answering incentive system needs to factor in the value and difficulty of answering the questions (e.g., by providing more rewards to harder questions or questions that remain unanswered for a long period of time).},

Therefore, this paper proposes a severity prediction on affective probabilistic multimodel software bugs. First, this paper uses RoBERTa as a sentiment analysis model and proposes a model training method for defective knowledge enhancement. We use Stack Overflow to construct a manually annotated sentiment probability dataset. Evaluating consistency between sentiment annotators by calculating Fleiss’ kappa values. Next, the difference in the impact of defects of different severity on users is reflected by the probability of sentiment. Using sentiment traits for the next stage of prediction. Finally, these include robust data processing of heterogeneous bug data, a complementary integrated learning framework that incorporates large linguistic and traditional tabular models, and a powerful model integration strategy based on a novel combination of multi-layer stacking and cyclic k-fold integrated bagging. Our comprehensive empirical assessment shows that SPM is more accurate and reliable than the popular defect severity prediction methods.},

abstract = {The reputation mechanism is a commonly used incentive mechanism to motivate users to participate in Q&amp;A communities, which needs to be carefully reviewed before application. Predicting the impact of reputation mechanisms can help community managers to choose an appropriate mechanism. However, existing methods are difficult to establish the connection between users and reputation mechanisms and their influence in Q&amp;A communities, which may lead to misleading results. Hence, we propose a MASC method combining multi-agent and case-based reasoning systems. We model incentive rules as norms in a multi-agent system composed of heterogeneous agents. We describe the impact of incentive mechanisms from three aspects: user attributes, behaviour, and content structure. Based on past user behaviour data, we present how to predict future behaviour and interaction based on similar user contribution patterns. In addition, we use the developed simulator to reproduce the impact of reputation mechanisms on Q&amp;A communities. We use a new reputation mechanism of the Stack Overflow community to evaluate the performance of MASC. Except for questioning preference, the prediction accuracy for the influence exceeds 65\%.},

Objectives and Key Results (OKRs) is a goal-setting framework applied in such distributed settings. This research aimed to investigate how OKRs are used in large-scale agile contexts. We interviewed team members and analyzed documents, including a survey. Our study’s results provide both enabling and limiting situations that make team members’ utilization of the framework either easier or more difficult. We found that OKRs aided knowledge sharing and improved transparency between teams. We present four strategies used for overcoming challenges and maximizing the benefits of using a goal-setting framework. An important takeaway is that companies that employ OKRs must support their employees, especially in defining key outcomes that align and encourage teams toward a common goal.},

abstract = {Automated completion of knowledge graphs is a popular topic in the Semantic Web community that aims to automatically and continuously integrate new appearing knowledge into knowledge graphs using artificial intelligence. Recently, approaches that leverage implicit knowledge from language models for this task have shown promising results. However, by fine-tuning language models directly to the domain of knowledge graphs, models forget their original language representation and associated knowledge. An existing solution to address this issue is a trainable adapter, which is integrated into a frozen language model to extract the relevant knowledge without altering the model itself. However, this constrains the generalizability to the specific extraction task and by design requires new and independent adapters to be trained for new knowledge extraction tasks. This effectively prevents the model from benefiting from existing knowledge incorporated in previously trained adapters.In this paper, we propose to combine the benefits of adapters for knowledge graph completion with the idea of integrating capsules, introduced in the field of continual learning. This allows the continuous integration of knowledge into a joint model by sharing and reusing previously trained capsules. We find that our approach outperforms solutions using traditional adapters, while requiring notably fewer parameters for continuous knowledge integration. Moreover, we show that this architecture benefits significantly from knowledge sharing in low-resource situations, outperforming adapter-based models on the task of link prediction.},

abstract = {Although pre-trained language models~(PLMs) have recently advanced the research progress in mathematical reasoning, they are not specially designed as a capable multi-task solver, suffering from high cost for multi-task deployment (e.g. a model copy for a task) and inferior performance on complex mathematical problems in practical applications. To address these issues, we propose JiuZhang 2.0, a unified Chinese PLM specially for multi-task mathematical problem solving. Our idea is to maintain a moderate-sized model and employ the cross-task knowledge sharing to improve the model capacity in a multi-task setting. Specially, we construct a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture for modeling mathematical text, to capture the common mathematical knowledge across tasks. For optimizing the MoE architecture, we design multi-task continual pre-training and multi-task fine-tuning strategies for multi-task adaptation. These training strategies can effectively decompose the knowledge from the task data and establish the cross-task sharing via expert networks. To further improve the general capacity of solving different complex tasks, we leverage large language models (LLMs) as complementary models to iteratively refine the generated solution by our PLM, via in-context learning. Extensive experiments have demonstrated the effectiveness of our model.},

Nevertheless, we trained a Transformer-based query tagger which we integrated with the rest of the pipeline using a reward and penalisation approach. We present techniques that we designed in order to address challenges with the type dictionary, incompatibilities in scoring between the term-based and vector-based methods as well as over-segmentation issues in Thai, Chinese, and Japanese.

abstract = {Online knowledge sharing is an important factor in ensuring students continues learning outside the classroom. The advancement of technology now allows the students’ sharing of knowledge to take place regardless of time and place in an online learning environment using an online discussion interface. Efforts have been taken by many higher education institutions to encourage students to share their knowledge in online discussion interface, but however it fails to sustain the knowledge sharing activities. This poses the question of how to promote the knowledge sharing activities among students. While previous research adopted the usability and sociability as antecedents for the online knowledge sharing activities, this study further explores visual aesthetics and intrinsic motivation design as additional two antecedents. We propose a set of contextual gamification and social media strategies which apply self-determination theory to self-motivate students for online knowledge sharing. It was found the game and social media elements can motivate the user in the online interface. The implementation of game elements in online interface can engage users while encouraging their activities for learning. Thus intrinsic motivation was designed using a set of gamification and social media specifications to enhance students’ self-motivation for knowledge sharing activities. The research model with 53 items was tested for content validity to identify the initial measures for online knowledge sharing. Based on the content validity analysis, 20 items that does not fit into the criteria was discarded from the instrument. Our finding reveals that 33 items from usability, visual aesthetics, sociality and intrinsic motivation design can be used for initial development of online knowledge sharing model.},

abstract = {Once a programmer knows one language, they can leverage concepts and knowledge already learned, and easily pick up another programming language. But is that always the case? To understand if programmers have difficulty learning additional programming languages, we conductedan empirical study of Stack Overflow questions across 18 different programming languages. We hypothesized that previous knowledge could potentially interfere with learning a new programming language. From our inspection of 450 Stack Overflow questions, we found 276 instances of interference that occurred due to faulty assumptions originating from knowledge about a different language. To understand why these difficulties occurred, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 16 professional programmers. The interviews revealed that programmers make failed attempts to relate a new programming language with what they already know.

abstract = {Zines (as in magazines) are self-published publications that are often created, produced, and distributed by their author(s). When members of a community of interest co-create zines together, they construct narratives through their editorial juxtaposition and styling of individual contributions on a given topic. While zines are increasingly being used in the HCI field as a medium or format for knowledge-sharing and/or community-building, collaborative zine making is less explored as a participatory design process that may illuminate both individual and shared narratives. Zineography is an unfolding exhibit of the process of collaborative zine making, through which PDC 2022 attendees are invited to creatively contribute and collaborate on zines exploring personal experiences related to conference themes. Zineography highlights how collaborative zine making can operate as a participatory design process that retains the plurality of individual expressions while facilitating the co-construction of shared narratives through editorial design practices.

abstract = {With the raised privacy concerns and rigorous data regulations, federated learning has become a hot collaborative learning paradigm for the recommendation model without sharing the highly sensitive POI data. However, the time-sensitive, heterogeneous, and limited POI records seriously restrict the development of federated POI recommendation. To this end, in this paper, we design the fine-grained preference-aware personalized federated POI recommendation framework, namely PrefFedPOI, under extremely sparse historical trajectories to address the above challenges. In details, PrefFedPOI extracts the fine-grained preference of current time slot by combining historical recent preferences and periodic preferences within each local client. Due to the extreme lack of POI data in some time slots, a data amount aware selective strategy is designed for model parameters uploading. Moreover, a performance enhanced clustering mechanism with reinforcement learning is proposed to capture the preference relatedness among all clients to encourage the positive knowledge sharing. Furthermore, a clustering teacher network is designed for improving efficiency by clustering guidance. Extensive experiments are conducted on two diverse real-world datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed PrefFedPOI comparing with state-of-the-arts. In particular, personalized PrefFedPOI can achieve 7\% accuracy improvement on average among data-sparsity clients.},

abstract = {Point cloud registration is a challenging task in both computer vision and pattern recognition. In general, the success of well-known registration algorithms depends heavily on the assumption of an initial near-optimal transformation. To address this problem, we propose a coarse-to-fine point cloud registration algorithm based on evolutionary multitasking. Specifically, the point cloud registration problem is solved by knowledge sharing before the coarse alignment task and the fine alignment task. In addition, an effective knowledge transfer mechanism and chaotic opposition search strategy are also developed to improve the effective knowledge transfer between tasks and enhance the exploration of more unknown areas in the population, respectively. The performance of the new approach is examined on 14 models from two datasets and compared with 6 competitive methods. Experimental results show that the new approach has the best robustness and accuracy. The new approach improved the registration success rate by 68\% through evolutionary multitasking without providing initial transformation information.},

Using what approach to measure the knowledge contribution is critical for improving the efficiency of knowledge collaboration. Based on the studies of knowledge sharing barrier, this paper decomposed knowledge contribution into technological, communication and organization contribution and advocated the peer-assessment for knowledge contribution. Finding antecedents of each contribution is also crucial for accurate and effective knowledge management. Combined with the individual behavior model and IS success model, this paper proposed following antecedents: motivation, perception, ability and personality. Motivation and perception are intentional antecedents, but ability and personality are unintentional. In accordance with a field study of 250 employees, nested into 50 groups, we discover that individual learning motivation and perception of explicit knowledge heterogeneity can promote technological contribution but perception of tacit knowledge heterogeneity has an opposite effect; group motivation of social identity, acquisition ability and agreeableness traits increase communication contribution; group motivation, application ability and agreeableness enhance organization contribution.},

abstract = {In location-based social Q&amp;A, the questions related to a local community (e.g. local services and places) are typically answered by local residents (i.e. who have the local knowledge). In this work, we wanted to deepen our understanding of the localness of knowledge sharing through investigating the topical and typological patterns related to the geographic characteristics, geographic locality of user activities, and motivations of local knowledge sharing. To this end, we analyzed a 12-month period Q&amp;A dataset from Naver KiN "Here" and a supplementary survey dataset from 285 mobile users. Our results revealed several unique characteristics of location-based social Q&amp;A. When compared with conventional social Q&amp;A sites, Naver KiN "Here" had very different topical/typological patterns. Naver KiN "Here" exhibited a strong spatial locality where the answerers mostly had 1-3 spatial clusters of contributions, the topical distributions varied widely across different districts, and a typical cluster spanned a few neighboring districts. In addition, we uncovered unique motivators, e.g. ownership of local knowledge and sense of local community. The findings reported in the paper have significant implications for the design of Q&amp;A systems, especially location-based social Q&amp;A systems.},

abstract = {In the last decade, developers have been increasingly sharing their questions with each other through Question and Answer (Q&amp;A) websites. As a result, these websites have become valuable knowledge repositories, covering a wealth of topics related to particular programming languages. This knowledge is even more useful as the developer community evaluates both questions and answers through a voting mechanism. As votes accumulate, the developer community recognizes reputed members and further trusts their answers. In this paper, we analyze the community's questions and answers to determine the developers' personality traits, using the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC). We explore the personality traits of Stack Overflow authors by categorizing them into different categories based on their reputation. Through textual analysis of Stack Overflow posts, we found that the top reputed authors are more extroverted compared to medium and low reputed users. Moreover, authors of up-voted posts express significantly less negative emotions than authors of down-voted posts.},

abstract = {The research on community question answering (CQA) has been paid increasing attention in recent years. In CQA, to reduce the number of unanswered questions and the time for askers to wait, it is very necessary to identify relevant experts or best answers for these questions. Generally, the experts' answers are more likely to be the best answers. Existing studies considered that user expertise is reflected by the voting scores of both answers and questions. However, voting scores of questions are not really related to user expertise. In this paper, we proposed a new probabilistic model to depict users' expertise based on answers and their descriptive ability based on questions. To exploit social information in CQA, the link analysis is also considered. Extensive experiments on the large Stack Overflow dataset demonstrate that our methods can achieve comparable or even better performance than the state-of-the-art models.},

The continued collaboration of groups of users who share interests in the same topics essentially make up communities, which are here referred to as topic-based communities. Analyzing the dynamics of such communities is key to understanding network processes such as the flow of users and information in the network. In this paper, we study how users relate to topic-based communities and how such relationship shapes long-term community dynamics. Using a large dataset collected from Stack Overflow, a popular programming oriented Q&amp;A site, we investigate several factors related to the evolution of communities in the site, such as user participation and the importance of revisits for community sustainability. Moreover, we develop a model to describe community evolution based on user activity which incorporates key aspects of community dynamics, including member revisits and the flow of users across related communities.},

We present an O(log n)-approximation algorithm for a broad class of hypergraph ratio cut objectives. This includes objectives involving generalized hypergraph cut functions, which allow a user to penalize cut hyperedges differently depending on the number of nodes in each cluster. Our method generalizes the cut-matching framework for graph ratio cuts, and relies only on solving maximum s-t flow problems in a special reduced graph. It is significantly faster than existing hypergraph ratio cut algorithms, while also solving a more general problem. In numerical experiments on various web-based hypergraphs, we show that it quickly finds ratio cut solutions within a small factor of optimality.},

abstract = {Extensive online knowledge sharing can be exploited to solve tasks better, faster and cheaper, and it garners considerable interest in institutional cooperation, learning communities, etc., while many technical problems, such as fair exchange in incentive design and security issues are waiting to be solved. Blockchain technique has high accountability and thus has potential to improve the transparency and security of knowledge sharing. In this paper, to address the above problems, first we propose a Reputation Based Knowledge Sharing system in blockchain, called RBKS. The aim of RBKS is to exploit the copyright protection of the knowledge owner using our proposed fine-grained access control system, and to achieve the paid-for content service which allows bystanders who are interested in the shared knowledge to pay a small fee for the access. Second, a reputation evaluation algorithm is introduced as the core of the incentive, and it may possibly be combined with stake in blockchain to form a hybrid stake for the RBKS system. Third, a blockchain and a trusted storage server are employed together for sharing and storing knowledge, and the main procedures are implemented with smart contract in blockchain to ensure secure execution and fairness. Finally, our analysis shows that the RBKS system is feasible and secure.},

It has been emphasized that effective knowledge sharing can even determine the success of projects in organizations. In reality, there are reports on the high failure rate in information systems development projects in organization. In order to address the above mentioned issue, this study with a comprehensive literature review, proposed a conceptual model of the factors affecting knowledge sharing in of information systems development projects. This model suggests that personality factors and leadership qualities have essential role in knowledge sharing among project team members. This model help project managers to identify important factors affecting knowledge sharing, create suitable behavior among their employees and enhance their project success rate.},

abstract = {Chatbots are becoming increasingly popular due to their benefits in saving costs, time, and effort. This is due to the fact that they allow users to communicate and control different services easily through natural language. Chatbot development requires special expertise (e.g., machine learning and conversation design) that differ from the development of traditional software systems. At the same time, the challenges that chatbot developers face remain mostly unknown since most of the existing studies focus on proposing chatbots to perform particular tasks rather than their development.Therefore, in this paper, we examine the Q&amp;A website, Stack Overflow, to provide insights on the topics that chatbot developers are interested and the challenges they face. In particular, we leverage topic modeling to understand the topics that are being discussed by chatbot developers on Stack Overflow. Then, we examine the popularity and difficulty of those topics. Our results show that most of the chatbot developers are using Stack Overflow to ask about implementation guidelines. We determine 12 topics that developers discuss (e.g., Model Training) that fall into five main categories. Most of the posts belong to chatbot development, integration, and the natural language understanding (NLU) model categories. On the other hand, we find that developers consider the posts of building and integrating chatbots topics more helpful compared to other topics. Specifically, developers face challenges in the training of the chatbot's model. We believe that our study guides future research to propose techniques and tools to help the community at its early stages to overcome the most popular and difficult topics that practitioners face when developing chatbots.},

Conversation allows people to take turns to make contributions, plan joint actions, align shared understanding of work status and resolve action failure. However, when such collaboration involves non-human AI actors like chatbots, there is a lack of understanding of how human participants may respond to the chatbot’s prompts and guidance, and whether the interaction can similarly improve the actionability of instructions given to people. In this study, we prototyped a chatbot system, ActionaBot for providing task instructions to novice workers, and conducted an initial study to explore its effects on procedural instruction giving and following. Our results indicate that, novices although might perceive instructions to be inactionable due to prior experience and how instructions were authored, they were able to follow conversational guidance and willing to adapt to the chatbot through turn-taking to calibrate working states back-and-forth. Besides, users’ awareness of the work status increased with the conversational prompts from the chatbot.},

In the legal domain, there is a large knowledge gap between the experts and the searchers, and the content on the legal QA websites consist of a combination formal and informal communication. In this paper, we propose methods for generating query-dependent textual profiles for lawyers covering several aspects including sentiment, comments, and recency. We combine query-dependent profiles with existing expert finding methods. Our experiments are conducted on a novel dataset gathered from an online legal QA service. We discovered that taking into account different lawyer profile aspects improves the best baseline model. We make our dataset publicly available for future work.},

However, most of answerers are ordinary with just basic background knowledge in certain areas. To help askers to get their preferable answers, a set of possible expert users should be recommended. There have been some studies on the expert recommendation in CQA, the latest work models the user expertise under topics, where each topic is learnt based on the content and tags of questions and answers. Practically, such topics are too general, whereas question tags can be more informative and valuable than the topic of each question. In this paper, we study the user expertise under tags. Experimental analysis on a large data set from Stack Overflow demonstrates that our method performs better than the up-to-date method.},

abstract = {Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) in software libraries play an important role in modern software development. Although most libraries provide API documentation as a reference, developers may find it difficult to directly search for appropriate APIs in documentation using the natural language description of the programming tasks. We call such phenomenon as knowledge gap, which refers to the fact that API documentation mainly describes API functionality and structure but lacks other types of information like concepts and purposes. In this paper, we propose a Java API recommendation tool named BIKER (Bi-Information source based KnowledgE Recommendation) to bridge the knowledge gap. We implement BIKER as a search engine website. Given a query in natural language, instead of directly searching API documentation, BIKER first searches for similar API-related questions on Stack Overflow to extract candidate APIs. Then, BIKER ranks them by considering the query’s similarity with both Stack Overflow posts and API documentation. Finally, to help developers better understand why each API is recommended and how to use them in practice, BIKER summarizes and presents supplementary information (e.g., API description, code examples in Stack Overflow posts) for each recommended API. Our quantitative evaluation and user study demonstrate that BIKER can help developers find appropriate APIs more efficiently and precisely.},

Over the years, Stack Overflow has accumulated an impressive knowledge base of snippets of code that are amply documented. We are interested in studying how programmers use these snippets of code in their projects. Can we find Stack Overflow snippets in real projects? When snippets are used, is this copy literal or does it suffer adaptations? And are these adaptations specializations required by the idiosyncrasies of the target artifact, or are they motivated by specific requirements of the programmer? The large-scale study presented on this paper analyzes 909k non-fork Python projects hosted on Github, which contain 290M function definitions, and 1.9M Python snippets captured in Stack Overflow. Results are presented as quantitative analysis of block-level code cloning intra and inter Stack Overflow and GitHub, and as an analysis of programming behaviors through the qualitative analysis of our findings.},

Current tools lack a way to label arbitrary code at scale while maintaining up-to-date representations of new programming languages, libraries, and functionalities. Comprehensive labeling of source code enables users to search for documents of interest and obtain a high-level understanding of their contents. We use Stack Overflow code snippets and their tags to train a language-agnostic, deep convolutional neural network to automatically predict semantic labels for source code documents. On Stack Overflow code snippets, we demonstrate a mean area under ROC of 0.957 over a long-tailed list of 4,508 tags. We also manually validate the model outputs on a diverse set of unlabeled source code documents retrieved from Github, and obtain a top-1 accuracy of 86.6\%. This strongly indicates that the model successfully transfers its knowledge from Stack Overflow snippets to arbitrary source code documents.},

abstract = {Executing code is essential for various program analysis tasks,  
e.g., to detect bugs that manifest through exceptions or to  
obtain execution traces for further dynamic analysis. How-  
ever, executing an arbitrary piece of code is often difficult in  
practice, e.g., because of missing variable definitions, miss-  
ing user inputs, and missing third-party dependencies. This  
paper presents LExecutor, a learning-guided approach for  
executing arbitrary code snippets in an underconstrained  
way. The key idea is to let a neural model predict missing  
values that otherwise would cause the program to get stuck,  
and to inject these values into the execution. For example,  
LExecutor injects likely values for otherwise undefined vari-  
ables and likely return values of calls to otherwise missing  
functions. We evaluate the approach on Python code from  
popular open-source projects and on code snippets extracted  
from Stack Overflow. The neural model predicts realistic  
values with an accuracy between 79.5\% and 98.2\%, allowing  
LExecutor to closely mimic real executions. As a result, the  
approach successfully executes significantly more code than  
any available technique, such as simply executing the code  
as-is. For example, executing the open-source code snippets  
as-is covers only 4.1\% of all lines, because the code crashes  
early on, whereas LExecutor achieves a coverage of 51.6\%.},

abstract = {Microcontrollers are the heart of embedded systems. Due to cost and power constraints, they do not have memory management units (MMUs) or even memory protection units (MPUs). As a result, embedded software faces two related challenges both concerned with the stack. First, in a multi-tasking environment, physical memory used by the stack is usually statically allocated per task. Second, a stack overflow is difficult to detect for lower-end microcontrollers without an MPU.In this work, we argue that segmented stacks, a notion investigated and subsequently dismissed for systems with virtual memory, can solve both challenges for embedded software. We show that many problems with segmented stacks vanish on embedded systems and present novel solutions to the rest. Importantly, we show that segmented stacks, combined with Rust, can guarantee memory safety without MMU or MPU. Moreover, segmented stacks allow memory to be dynamically allocated to per-task stacks and can improve memory efficiency when combined with proper scheduling.},

There has been no large-scale, systematic empirical evidence to reconcile these performance debates. In the paper, we create a large synthetic dataset with 24,126 pairs of non-idiomatic and functionally-equivalent idiomatic code for the nine unique Python idioms identified in [1], and reuse a large real-project dataset of 54,879 such code pairs provided in [1]. We develop a reliable performance measurement method to compare the speedup or slowdown by idiomatic code against non-idiomatic counterpart, and analyze the performance discrepancies between the synthetic and real-project code, the relationships between code features and performance changes, and the root causes of performance changes at the bytecode level. We summarize our findings as some actionable suggestions for using Python idioms.},

abstract = {Expert finding aims at seeking potential users to answer new questions in Community Question Answering (CQA) websites. Most existing methods focus on designing matching frameworks between questions and experts, and rely on negative sampling technology for model training. However, sampling would lose lots of useful information about experts and questions, and make these sampling-based methods suffer the bias and non-robust issues, which may lead to an insufficient matching performance for expert findings. In this paper, we propose a novel Efficient Non-sampling Expert Finding model, named ENEF, which could learn accurate representations of questions and experts from whole training data. In our approach, we adopt a rather basic question encoder and a simple matching framework, then an efficient whole-data optimization method is elaborately designed to learn the model parameters without negative sampling with rather a low space and time complexity. Extensive experimental results on four real-world CQA datasets demonstrate that our model ENEF could achieve better performance and faster training efficiency than existing state-of-the-art expert finding methods.},

Previous research proved to be reasonably successful in using properties of questions to help identify low quality questions to be later reviewed and improved.We present an approach to improve the classification of high and low quality questions based on a novel source of information: the analysis of the code fragments in SO questions.

abstract = {Developers often consult online tutorials and message boards to find solutions to their programming issues. Among the many online resources, Question \&amp; Answer websites are gaining popularity. This is no wonder if we consider a case like Stack Overflow, where more than 92\% questions on expert topics are answered in a median time of 11 minutes. This new resource has scarcely been acknowledged by any Integrated Development Environment (IDE): Even though developers spend a large part of their working time in IDEs, and the usage of Q&amp;A services has dramatically increased, developers can only use such resources using external applications.We introduce Seahawk, an Eclipse plugin to integrate Stack Overflow crowd knowledge in the IDE. It allows developers to seamlessly access Stack Overflow data, thus obtaining answers without switching the context. We present our preliminary work on Seahawk: It allows users to (1) retrieve Q&amp;A from Stack Overflow, (2) link relevant discussions to any source code in Eclipse, and (3) attach explanative comments to the links.},

abstract = {Deep learning (DL) systems are complex component-based systems, which consist of core program (code implementation and data), Python (language and interpreter), third-party libraries, low-level libraries, development tools, OS, and hardware environments. Incompatible interaction between components would cause serious compatibility issues, substantially affecting the development and deployment processes. What types of compatibility issues are frequently exposed in DL systems? What are the root causes of such issues and how do developers fix them? How far are we from automatically detecting and fixing DL compatibility issues? Although there are many existing studies on DL bugs, the characteristics of DL compatibility issues have rarely been systematically studied and the above questions remain largely unexplored. To fill this gap, we conduct the first comprehensive empirical study to characterize compatibility issues in DL systems. Through analyzing 352 DL compatibility issues classified from 3,072 posts in Stack Overflow, we present their types, manifestation stages, and symptoms. We further summarize the root causes and common fixing strategies, and conduct a tool survey on the current research status of automated detection and repair of DL compatibility issues. Our study allows researchers and practitioners to gain a better understanding of DL compatibility issues and can facilitate future tool development.},

abstract = {Norms are behavioral expectations in communities. Online communities are also expected to abide by the established practices that are expressed in the code of conduct of a system. Even though community authorities continuously prompt their users to follow the regulations, it is observed that hate speech and abusive language usage are on the rise. In this paper, we quantify and analyze the patterns of violations of normative behaviour among the users of Stack Overflow (SO) – a well-known technical question-answer site for professionals and enthusiast programmers, while posting a comment. Even though the site has been dedicated to technical problem solving and debugging, hate speech as well as posting offensive comments make the community “toxic”. By identifying and minimising various patterns of norm violations in different SO communities, the community would become less toxic and thereby the community can engage more effectively in its goal of knowledge sharing. Moreover, through automatic detection of such comments, the authors can be warned by the moderators, so that it is less likely to be repeated, thereby the reputation of the site and community can be improved. Based on the comments extracted from two different data sources on SO, this work first presents a taxonomy of norms that are violated. Second, it demonstrates the sanctions for certain norm violations. Third, it proposes a recommendation system that can be used to warn users that they are about to violate a norm. This can help achieve norm adherence in online communities.},

abstract = {As the popularity of modern social coding paradigm such as Stack Overflow grows, its potential security risks increase as well (e.g., insecure codes could be easily embedded and distributed). To address this largely overlooked issue, in this paper, we bring an important new insight to exploit social coding properties in addition to code content for automatic detection of insecure code snippets in Stack Overflow. To determine if the given code snippets are insecure, we not only analyze the code content, but also utilize various kinds of relations among users, badges, questions, answers, code snippets and keywords in Stack Overflow. To model the rich semantic relationships, we first introduce a structured heterogeneous information network (HIN) for representation and then use meta-path based approach to incorporate higher-level semantics to build up relatedness over code snippets. Later, we propose a novel network embedding model named snippet2vec for representation learning in HIN where both the HIN structures and semantics are maximally preserved. After that, a multi-view fusion classifier is constructed for insecure code snippet detection. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work utilizing both code content and social coding properties to address the code security issues in modern software coding platforms. Comprehensive experiments on the data collections from Stack Overflow are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the developed system ICSD which integrates our proposed method in insecure code snippet detection by comparisons with alternative approaches.},

abstract = {There are significant regional inequities in health resources around the world. It has become one of the most focused topics to improve health services for data-scarce hospitals and promote health equity through knowledge sharing among medical institutions. Because electronic medical records (EMRs) contain sensitive personal information, privacy protection is unavoidable and essential for multi-hospital collaboration. In this paper, for a common disease in ICU patients, sepsis, we propose a novel cross-center collaborative learning framework guided by medical knowledge, SofaNet, to achieve early recognition of this disease. The Sepsis-3 guideline, published in 2016, defines that sepsis can be diagnosed by satisfying both suspicion of infection and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) greater than or equal to 2. Based on this knowledge, SofaNet adopts a multi-channel GRU structure to predict SOFA values of different systems, which can be seen as an auxiliary task to generate better health status representations for sepsis recognition. Moreover, we only achieve feature distribution alignment in the hidden space during cross-center collaborative learning, which ensures secure and compliant knowledge transfer without raw data exchange. Extensive experiments on two open clinical datasets, MIMIC-III and Challenge, demonstrate that SofaNet can benefit early sepsis recognition when hospitals only have limited EMRs.},

Eldorado is based in Brazil and works closely with other teams worldwide (China, United States, and India). Handling the project management considering this complex GSD scenario brings many challenges, one of them is the knowledge sharing on new development processes. As each region has its own set of procedures and specific carriers, the newcomers need to learn the new working processes. Even having a Wiki space to share information, the members report great difficulty using it, especially when they start to work on a project from a different region. For this reason, we developed a labeling-oriented project management approach based on identifying and defining project patterns. This experience report describes how we reduced the knowledge information required to manage a mobile software development process, the lessons learned applying the developed approach in mobile projects, and the future steps to improve it.},

abstract = {Collaborative live chats are gaining popularity as a development communication tool. In community live chatting, developers are likely to post issues they encountered (e.g., setup issues and compile issues), and other developers respond with possible solutions. Therefore, community live chats contain rich sets of information for reported issues and their corresponding solutions, which can be quite useful for knowledge sharing and future reuse if extracted and restored in time. However, it remains challenging to accurately mine such knowledge due to the noisy nature of interleaved dialogs in live chat data. In this paper, we first formulate the problem of issue-solution pair extraction from developer live chat data, and propose an automated approach, named ISPY, based on natural language processing and deep learning techniques with customized enhancements, to address the problem. Specifically, ISPY automates three tasks: 1) Disentangle live chat logs, employing a feedforward neural network to disentangle a conversation history into separate dialogs automatically; 2) Detect dialogs discussing issues, using a novel convolutional neural network (CNN), which consists of a BERT-based utterance embedding layer, a context-aware dialog embedding layer, and an output layer; 3) Extract appropriate utterances and combine them as corresponding solutions, based on the same CNN structure but with different feeding inputs. To evaluate ISPY, we compare it with six baselines, utilizing a dataset with 750 dialogs including 171 issue-solution pairs and evaluate ISPY from eight open source communities. The results show that, for issue-detection, our approach achieves the F1 of 76\%, and outperforms all baselines by 30\%. Our approach achieves the F1 of 63\% for solution-extraction and outperforms the baselines by 20\%. Furthermore, we apply ISPY on three new communities to extensively evaluate ISPY's practical usage. Moreover, we publish over 30K issue-solution pairs extracted from 11 communities. We believe that ISPY can facilitate community-based software development by promoting knowledge sharing and shortening the issue-resolving process.},

abstract = {With the rapid growth of online social network sites such as Face-book and Twitter, social question and answering (Q&amp;A) has become an important venue for people to seek and share information. However, due to lack of specific Q&amp;A feature design and users' motivations in answering questions, social Q&amp;A has been reported to have a much lower response rate compared with traditional professional Q&amp;A sites such as Stack Overflow and Yahoo! Answers. Recently, WenDa, an emerging social Q&amp;A product built on top of a leading Chinese social website (Sina WeiBo) has been launched to fill this gap. WenDa employs a novel economic model to motivate users to ask and answer questions. In this paper, we conduct an empirical study to understand the effectiveness of this economic model in motivating users to participate in the social Q&amp;A. Besides, we analyze how this economic model and the social user relationships shape the question types as well as question topics. Our observations and study results are of significant values in providing insights for the design and development of social Q&amp;A.},

This paper is based on exploratory survey to assess the knowledge sharing techniques amongst the jua kali artisans in Kenya. This study sought to analyze knowledge sharing amongst Jua Kali workers in Kenya; Describe the nature of their business; investigate the type of knowledge they posses; identify the knowledge sharing mechanism they use; analyze how effective the knowledge sharing mechanisms have been; identify the challenges affecting the effective sharing of knowledge; and propose strategies which can be used by the Jua Kali workers in Kenya to enhance effective knowledge sharing.Primary data was collected through interviews using self-administered questionnaires which were distributed to the Jua kali artisans. Additional information on Jua kali workers was collected from relevant scholarly documents analysis. The findingsindicate that most of the Jua Kali workers use mentoring as a way of sharing knowledge. These knowledge sharing techniques are hampered by language barrier this is because some of the mentors or trainees are largely illiterate and can only communicate in their vernaculars. The findings can be use by the Kenyan government to develop a training of trainers programme for the experienced artisans to equip them with new skills as well as how to impart them.},

Prior studies have shown low participation of women programmers on Stack Overflow, but have not demonstrated how the presence of their peers may promote activity. In this work, we understand how the presence of women, through peer parity, can encourage women to participate more on Stack Overflow. We extracted 3,2209,817 posts from the most recent Stack Overflow data dump. By modifying a popular gender computing tool, we took the first names of online users and identified the gender of 2,502,438 users from the 5,987,284 list of current users. We randomly selected peer parity and non peer parity questions asked by women and identify differences in participation on those posts. We found that women become more active after they have taken part in a peer parity post. With further analysis of peer parity through eye tracking and tone detection tools we can determine ways to foster a more welcoming community that would encourage women to participate.},

abstract = {As a means to share knowledge, the community question answering (CQA) service provides users a chance to obtain or provide help by raising or answering questions. After a question is posted, the system must find an appropriate individual to answer this question. Several approaches have recently been proposed to find experts in CQA. In this paper, a new method to find experts in CQA is proposed by considering user post contents, answer votes, ratio of best answers, and user relation. The votes are used in post relation analysis to calculate user authority. The user's knowledge score can be calculated through topic analysis. Considering that a question usually includes many trivial words, an accurate distribution is nearly impossible to obtain with LDA. To solve this problem, vocabulary is extended by including the link information shown in a question, the top 10 relevant words from Wikipedia are provided for each tag. Tag-LDA models the user topic distribution and predicts the topic distribution of new questions. An experiment is conducted on Stack Overflow dataset, which is the world's largest computer programming CQA site. Experimental results showed approximately 2.97\% to 7.79\% performance improvement in nDCG@N metrics.},

abstract = {Reactive programming is a programming paradigm that enables systems to automatically react to changes in data or events in a responsive and asynchronous manner, leveraging the concept of streams. The adoption of reactive programming techniques has grown significantly, particularly in developing mobile applications that demand efficient frameworks for creating adaptable and scalable systems. An example of such a framework is Combine, introduced by Apple in 2019 for Swift application development on the iOS platform. A framework that is worth mentioning is Combine, which was introduced by Apple in 2019 for Swift application development on the iOS platform. However, transitioning from imperative to reactive paradigms presents complex challenges for developers. This study aims to address the research gap that exists in Swift Combine by identifying and understanding the key challenges faced by developers when adopting and using that framework. Using a data mining approach, we analyzed questions and accepted answers from Stack Overflow related to Combine usage. Employing topic modeling with Latent Dirichlet Allocation, our analysis revealed 14 topics related to Combine usage, highlighting the most relevant and challenging aspects. These findings provide valuable insights for developers learning or incorporating Combine into their applications and serve as a reference for future studies in the field.},

Hence, they frequently submit their questions with sample code segments and issue descriptions. Unfortunately, it is not always possible to reproduce their reported issues from such code segments. This phenomenon might prevent their questions from getting prompt and appropriate solutions. In this paper, we report an exploratory study on the reproducibility of the issues discussed in 400 questions of Stack Overflow. In particular, we parse, compile, execute and even carefully examine the code segments from these questions, spent a total of 200 man hours, and then attempt to reproduce their programming issues. The outcomes of our study are two-fold. First, we find that 68\% of the code segments require minor and major modifications in order to reproduce the issues reported by the developers. On the contrary, 22\% code segments completely fail to reproduce the issues. We also carefully investigate why these issues could not be reproduced and then provide evidence-based guidelines for writing effective code examples for Stack Overflow questions. Second, we investigate the correlation between issue reproducibility status (of questions) and corresponding answer meta-data such as the presence of an accepted answer. According to our analysis, a question with reproducible issues has at least three times higher chance of receiving an accepted answer than the question with irreproducible issues.},

abstract = {Application programming interfaces (APIs) have become ubiquitous in software development. However, external APIs are not guaranteed to contain every desirable feature, nor are they immune to software defects. Therefore, API users will sometimes be faced with situations where a current API does not satisfy all of their requirements, but migrating to another API is costly. In these cases, due to the lack of communication channels between API developers and users, API users may intentionally bypass an existing API after inquiring into workarounds for their API problems with online communities. This mechanism takes the API developer out of the conversation, potentially leaving API defects unreported and desirable API features undiscovered. In this paper we explore API workaround inquiries from API users on Stack Overflow. We uncover general reasons why API users inquire about API workarounds, and general solutions to API workaround requests. Furthermore, using workaround implementations in Stack Overflow answers, we develop three API workaround implementation patterns. We identify instances of these patterns in real-life open source projects and determine their value for API developers from their responses to feature requests based on the identified API workarounds.},

abstract = {Communication between a software development team and business partners is often a challenging task due to the different context of terms used in the information exchange. The various contexts in which the concepts are defined or used create slightly different semantic fields that can evolve into information and communication silos. Due to the silo effect, the necessary information is often inadequately forwarded to developers resulting in poorly specified software requirements or misinterpreted user feedback. Communication difficulties can be reduced by introducing a mapping between the semantic fields of the parties involved in the communication based on the commonly used terminologies. Our research aims to obtain a suitable semantic database in the form of a semantic network built from the Stack Overflow corpus, which can be considered to encompass the common tacit knowledge of the software development community. Terminologies used in the business world can be assigned to our semantic network, so software developers do not miss features that are not specific to their world but relevant to their clients. We present an initial experiment of mining semantic network from Stack Overflow and provide insights of the newly captured relations compared to WordNet.},

abstract = {Software repositories contain large amounts of textual data, ranging from source code comments and issue descriptions to questions, answers, and comments on Stack Overflow. To make sense of this textual data, topic modelling is frequently used as a text-mining tool for the discovery of hidden semantic structures in text bodies. Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) is a commonly used topic model that aims to explain the structure of a corpus by grouping texts. LDA requires multiple parameters to work well, and there are only rough and sometimes conflicting guidelines available on how these parameters should be set. In this paper, we contribute (i) a broad study of parameters to arrive at good local optima for GitHub and Stack Overflow text corpora, (ii) an a-posteriori characterisation of text corpora related to eight programming languages, and (iii) an analysis of corpus feature importance via per-corpus LDA configuration. We find that (1) popular rules of thumb for topic modelling parameter configuration are not applicable to the corpora used in our experiments, (2) corpora sampled from GitHub and Stack Overflow have different characteristics and require different configurations to achieve good model fit, and (3) we can predict good configurations for unseen corpora reliably. These findings support researchers and practitioners in efficiently determining suitable configurations for topic modelling when analysing textual data contained in software repositories.},

We collected 38,399 danmaku comments and 16,414 forum comments posted in 2017 on 30 popular videos on Bilibili.com. We examined the usage of these two features in terms of user participation, language used, and ways of sharing knowledge. We found that more users posted danmaku comments, and they also posted these more frequently than forum comments. Even though, in total, more negative language was used in danmaku comments than in forum comments, active users appeared to post more positive comments in danmaku. There was no such correlation in forum comments. It is interesting to find that danmaku and forum comments enabled knowledge sharing in a complementary manner, where danmaku comments involved more explicit knowledge sharing and forum comments exhibited more tacit knowledge sharing. We discuss design implications to promote social interactions for online video systems.},

Eight major topic categories and a two-level taxonomy for question type/intent and the characteristics of questions in each category are presented. Our findings suggest that Q&amp;A sites are a fruitful resource for identifying users' music information needs, how these needs are expressed, and intended uses for the information. On Music StackExchange, users' questioning behaviors were motivated by the recognition of knowledge gaps, lack of resources, need for others' opinions, or interest in research issues, spanning different topics. This study is explorative in nature and the results could improve the understanding of everyday life music information seeking. The findings can inform music librarians and general-purpose music information systems designers of the needs, requirements, and approaches to enhance music related controlled vocabularies, and improve search engines and online knowledge sharing communities to categorize and provide users with more relevant music information.},

abstract = {Expert Finding is an important task in Community Question Answering (CQA) platforms, which could help route questions to potential expertise users to answer. The key is to model the question content and experts based on their historical answered questions accurately. Recently Pretrained Language Models (PLMs, e.g., Bert) have shown superior text modeling ability and have been used in expert finding preliminary. However, most PLMs-based models focus on the corpus or document granularity during pretraining, which is inconsistent with the downstream expert modeling and finding task. In this paper, we propose an expert-level pretraining language model named ExpertBert, aiming to model questions, experts as well as question-expert matching effectively in a pretraining manner. In our approach, we aggregate the historical answered questions of an expert as the expert-specific input.Besides, we integrate the target question into the input and design a label-augmented Masked Language Model (MLM) task to further capture the matching pattern between question and experts, which makes the pretraining objectives that more closely resemble the downstream expert finding task. Experimental results and detailed analysis on real-world CQA datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our ExpertBert.},

We deployed a month long, just-in-time mentorship program to Stack Overflow in which we redirected novices in the process of asking a question to an on-site Help Room. There, novices received feedback on their question drafts from experienced Stack Overflow mentors. We present examples and discussion of various question improvements including: question context, code formatting, and wording that adheres to on-site cultural norms. We find that mentored questions are substantially improved over non-mentored questions, with average scores increasing by 50\%.

Our qualitative results show that MCR activities are not only about reviewing code but also with knowledge sharing applied at team/project level or between different levels of seniority.

abstract = {With the success of crowdsourced portals, such as Wikipedia, Stack Overflow, Quora, and GitHub, a class of researchers is driven towards understanding the dynamics of knowledge building on these portals. Even though collaborative knowledge building portals are known to be better than expert-driven knowledge repositories, limited research has been performed to understand the knowledge building dynamics in the former. This is mainly due to two reasons; first, unavailability of the standard data representation format, second, lack of proper tools and libraries to analyze the knowledge building dynamics.We describe Knowledge Data Analysis and Processing Platform (KDAP), a programming toolkit that is easy to use and provides high-level operations for analysis of knowledge data. We propose Knowledge Markup Language (Knol-ML), a standard representation format for the data of collaborative knowledge building portals. KDAP can process the massive data of crowdsourced portals like Wikipedia and Stack Overflow efficiently. As a part of this toolkit, a data-dump of various collaborative knowledge building portals is published in Knol-ML format. The combination of Knol-ML and the proposed open-source library will help the knowledge building community to perform benchmark analysis.URL:https://github.com/descentis/kdapSupplementary Material: https://bit.ly/2Z3tZK5},

abstract = {When knowledgeable colleagues are not available, developers resort to offline and online resources, e.g., tutorials, mailing lists, and Q&amp;A websites. These, however, need to be found, read, and understood, which takes its toll in terms of time and mental energy. A more immediate and accessible resource are video tutorials found on the web, which in recent years have seen a steep increase in popularity. Nonetheless, videos are an intrinsically noisy data source, and finding the right piece of information might be even more cumbersome than using the previously mentioned resources.We present CodeTube, an approach which mines video tutorials found on the web, and enables developers to query their contents. The video tutorials are split into coherent fragments, to return only fragments related to the query. These are complemented with information from additional sources, such as Stack Overflow discussions. The results of two studies to assess CodeTube indicate that video tutorials---if appropriately processed---represent a useful, yet still under-utilized source of information for software development.},

abstract = {Developer support forums are becoming more popular than ever. Crowdsourced knowledge is an essential resource for many developers yet it can raise concerns about the quality of the shared content. Most existing research efforts address the quality of answers posted by Q&amp;A community members. In this paper, we explore the quality of questions and propose a method of predicting the score of questions on Stack Overflow based on sixteen factors related to questions' format, content and interactions that occur in the post. We performed an extensive investigation to understand the relationship between the factors and the scores of questions. The multiple regression analysis shows that the question's length of the code, accepted answer score, number of tags and the count of views, comments and answers are statistically significantly associated with the scores of questions. Our findings can offer insights to community-based Q&amp;A sites for improving the content of the shared knowledge.},

abstract = {Developers often need to search for appropriate APIs for their programming tasks. Although most libraries have API reference documentation, it is not easy to find appropriate APIs due to the lexical gap and knowledge gap between the natural language description of the programming task and the API description in API documentation. Here, the lexical gap refers to the fact that the same semantic meaning can be expressed by different words, and the knowledge gap refers to the fact that API documentation mainly describes API functionality and structure but lacks other types of information like concepts and purposes, which are usually the key information in the task description. In this paper, we propose an API recommendation approach named BIKER (Bi-Information source based KnowledgE Recommendation) to tackle these two gaps. To bridge the lexical gap, BIKER uses word embedding technique to calculate the similarity score between two text descriptions. Inspired by our survey findings that developers incorporate Stack Overflow posts and API documentation for bridging the knowledge gap, BIKER leverages Stack Overflow posts to extract candidate APIs for a program task, and ranks candidate APIs by considering the query’s similarity with both Stack Overflow posts and API documentation. It also summarizes supplementary information (e.g., API description, code examples in Stack Overflow posts) for each API to help developers select the APIs that are most relevant to their tasks. Our evaluation with 413 API-related questions confirms the effectiveness of BIKER for both class- and method-level API recommendation, compared with state-of-the-art baselines. Our user study with 28 Java developers further demonstrates the practicality of BIKER for API search.},

abstract = {Knowledge sharing communities, such as Wikipedia or Yahoo! Answers, add greatly to the wealth of information available on the Web. They represent complex social ecosystems that rely on user paricipation and the quality of users' contributions to prosper. However, quality is harder to achieve when knowledge sharing is facilitated through a high degree of personal interactions. The individuals' objectives may change from knowledge sharing to socializing, with a profound impact on the community and the value it delivers to the broader population of Web users. In this paper we provide new insights into the types of content that is shared through Community Question Answering (CQA) services. We demonstrate an approach that combines in-depth content analysis with social network analysis techniques. We adapted the Undirected Inductive Coding method to analyze samples of user questions and arrive at a comprehensive typology of the user intent. In our analysis we focused on two types of intent, social vs. non-social, and define measures of social engagement to characterize the users' participation and content contributions. Our approach is applicable to a broad class of online communities and can be used to monitor the dynamics of community ecosystems.},

abstract = {Context: Stack Overflow is a popular community question and answer portal used by practitioners to solve problems during software development. Developers can focus their attention on answers that have been accepted or where members have recorded high votes in judging good answers when searching for help. However, the latter mechanism (votes) can be unreliable, and there is currently no way to differentiate between an answer that is likely to be accepted and those that will not be accepted by looking at the answer's characteristics. Objective: In potentially providing a mechanism to identify acceptable answers, this study examines the features that distinguish an accepted answer from an unaccepted answer. Methods: We studied the Stack Overflow dataset by analyzing questions and answers for the two most popular tags (Java and JavaScript). Our dataset comprised 249,588 posts drawn from 2014-2016. We use random forest and neural network models to predict accepted answers, and study the features with the highest predictive power in those two models. Results: Our findings reveal that the length of code in answers, reputation of users, similarity of the text between questions and answers, and the time lag between questions and answers have the highest predictive power for differentiating accepted and unaccepted answers. Conclusion: Tools may leverage these findings in supporting developers and reducing the effort they must dedicate to searching for suitable answers on Stack Overflow.},

abstract = {Software reuse is an important and crucial quality attribute in modern software engineering, where almost all software projects, open source or commercial, no matter small or ultra-large, source code reuse in one way or another. Although software reuse has experienced an increased adoption throughout the years with the exponentially growing number of available third-party libraries, frameworks and APIs, little knowledge exists to investigate what aspects of code reuse developers discuss. In this study, we look into bridging this gap by examining Stack Overflow to understand the challenges developers encounter when trying to reuse code. Using the Stack Overflow tags “code-reuse” and “reusability”, we extracted and analyzed 1,409 posts, composed of questions and answers. Our findings indicate that despite being popular, reuse questions take relatively longer than typical other questions to receive an accepted answer. From these posts, we identified 9 categories that group the different ways developers discuss software reuse. We found Java and ASP.NET MVC to be the most discussed programming language and framework, respectively. Based on the programming languages and frameworks mentioned in the posts, we noted that Web software development is the most frequently targeted environment. This study can be utilized to further analyze aspects about software reuse and develop guidelines to be practiced in industry and taught when forming new developers.},

abstract = {In this paper, we investigate the task of response ranking in conversational legal search. We propose a novel method for conversational passage response retrieval (ConvPR) for long conversations in domains with mixed levels of expertise. Conversational legal search is challenging because the domain includes long, multi-participant dialogues with domain-specific language. Furthermore, as opposed to other domains, there typically is a large knowledge gap between the questioner (a layperson) and the responders (lawyers), participating in the same conversation. We collect and release a large-scale real-world dataset called LegalConv with nearly one million legal conversations from a legal community question answering (CQA) platform. We address the particular challenges of processing legal conversations, with our novel Conversational Legal Longformer with Expertise-Aware Response Ranker, called CLosER. The proposed method has two main innovations compared to state-of-the-art methods for ConvPR: (i) Expertise-Aware Post-Training; a learning objective that takes into account the knowledge gap difference between participants to the conversation; and (ii) a simple but effective strategy for re-ordering the context utterances in long conversations to overcome the limitations of the sparse attention mechanism of the Longformer architecture. Evaluation on LegalConv shows that our proposed method substantially and significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art models on the response selection task. Our analysis indicates that our Expertise-Aware PostTraining, i.e., continued pre-training or domain/task adaptation, plays an important role in the achieved effectiveness. Our proposed method is generalizable to other tasks with domain-specific challenges and can facilitate future research on conversational search in other domains.},

abstract = {Parameter-Efficient transfer learning with Adapters have been studied in Natural Language Processing (NLP) as an alternative to full fine-tuning. Adapters are memory-efficient and scale well with downstream tasks by training small bottle-neck layers added between transformer layers while keeping the large pretrained language model (PLMs) frozen. In spite of showing promising results in NLP, these methods are under-explored in Information Retrieval. While previous studies have only experimented with dense retriever or in a cross lingual retrieval scenario, in this paper we aim to complete the picture on the use of adapters in IR. First, we study adapters for SPLADE, a sparse retriever, for which adapters not only retain the efficiency and effectiveness otherwise achieved by finetuning, but are memory-efficient and orders of magnitude lighter to train. We observe that Adapters-SPLADE not only optimizes just 2\% of training parameters, but outperforms fully fine-tuned counterpart and existing parameter-efficient dense IR models on IR benchmark datasets. Secondly, we address domain adaptation of neural retrieval thanks to adapters on cross-domain BEIR datasets and TripClick. Finally, we also consider knowledge sharing between rerankers and first stage rankers. Overall, our study complete the examination of adapters for neural IR. (The code can be found at: .)},

abstract = {Users may demand recommendations with highly personalized requirements involving logical operations, e.g., the intersection of two requirements, where such requirements naturally form structured logical queries on knowledge graphs (KGs). To date, existing recommender systems lack the capability to tackle users' complex logical requirements. In this work, we formulate the problem of recommendation with users' logical requirements (LogicRec) and construct benchmark datasets for LogicRec. Furthermore, we propose an initial solution for LogicRec based on logical requirement retrieval and user preference retrieval, where we face two challenges. First, KGs are incomplete in nature. Therefore, there are always missing true facts, which entails that the answers to logical requirements can not be completely found in KGs. In this case, item selection based on the answers to logical queries is not applicable. We thus resort to logical query embedding (LQE) to jointly infer missing facts and retrieve items based on logical requirements. Second, answer sets are under-exploited. Existing LQE methods can only deal with query-answer pairs, where queries in our case are the intersected user preferences and logical requirements. However, the logical requirements and user preferences have different answer sets, offering us richer knowledge about the requirements and preferences by providing requirement-item and preference-item pairs. Thus, we design a multi-task knowledge-sharing mechanism to exploit these answer sets collectively. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the significance of the LogicRec task and the effectiveness of our proposed method.},

To bring the best value out of these knowledge repositories, it is critically important for CQA services to know how to find the right experts, retrieve archived similar questions and recommend best answers to new questions. To tackle this cluster of closely related problems in a principled approach, we proposed Topic Expertise Model (TEM), a novel probabilistic generative model with GMM hybrid, to jointly model topics and expertise by integrating textual content model and link structure analysis. Based on TEM results, we proposed CQARank to measure user interests and expertise score under different topics. Leveraging the question answering history based on long-term community reviews and voting, our method could find experts with both similar topical preference and high topical expertise. Experiments carried out on Stack Overflow data, the largest CQA focused on computer programming, show that our method achieves significant improvement over existing methods on multiple metrics.},

Trade associations and government agencies have sought routes for Western games studios, publishers, and rights holders to connect with similar organisations in China. However, there has been limited focus on how Western and Chinese game developers understand and navigate the challenges of transnational collaboration and creativity in games production. This article presents a case study of five transnational game development teams, all of which were composed predominantly of developers from the UK and China who were tasked with producing game prototypes for both markets. Data gathered during game production included development diaries, interview data, game prototypes, and production documentation. Three themes emerged from analysis of the data: production practices and transnational working, navigating regulations and restrictions, and market and cultural differences. Findings highlight that developers encounter challenges around political and cultural difference that could inhibit production or lead to uncertainties in design decision making, but also that developers can quickly establish routes to collaboration and knowledge sharing that can help to overcome these barriers.},

Yet there is no large dataset of high-quality SO post summaries, hindering the development and evaluation of post summarization techniques. We present SOSum, a dataset of 2,278 popular SO answer posts with manually labeled summative sentences. Questions in SOSum cover 669 tags with a median view count of 253K and a median post score of 17.

We conducted a Systematic Mapping study involving 266 papers from six relevant databases to address this gap. In this preliminary work we explored the level of academic interest Stack Overflow has generated, the publication venues, the topics studied and approaches used. Outcomes show that Stack Overflow has attracted increasing research interest, with topics relating to both community dynamics and human factors, and technical issues. In addition, research studies have been largely evaluative or proposed solutions, though this latter approach tends to lack validation. This signals the need for future work to explore the nature of Stack Overflow research contributions that are provided, and their quality.

abstract = {Interactive information retrieval (IIR) models consider the implicit or explicit user feedback in order to understand their intent and improve the quality of retrieved documents. We are proposing an IIR model that combines explicit relevance feedback and learning to rank techniques to improve the quality of retrieved documents. Besides evaluating the proposed method in general information retrieval cases using LETOR datasets, we have applied it to the special case of Community Question Answering (CQA) systems using SemEval challenge data. The proposed method outperforms other existing learning to rank techniques on most of these datasets.},

abstract = {GitHub Actions is a powerful tool for automating workflows on GitHub repositories, with thousands of Actions currently available on the GitHub Marketplace. So far, the research community has conducted mining studies on Actions, with much of the focus on CI/CD. However, the motivation and best practices of developers for using, developing, and debugging Actions are unknown. To address this gap, we conducted a survey study with 90 Action users and developers. Our findings indicate that developers prefer Actions with verified creators and more stars when choosing between similar Actions, and often switch to alternative Actions when faced with bugs or a lack of documentation. We also found that developers find the composition of YAML files, which are essential for Action integration, challenging and error-prone. They primarily rely on Q&amp;A forums to fix issues with these YAML files. Finally, we observed that developers would not likely adopt Actions when there are concerns around complexity and security risks. Our study summarizes developers’ perceptions, decision-making process, and challenges in using, developing, and debugging Actions. We provide recommendations for improving the visibility, re-usability, documentation, and support surrounding GitHub Actions.},

abstract = {Active participation of users in Q&amp;A social networks like Stack Overflow is key to the sustenance of the network. One way to encourage participation is to allow collaboration or cooperation between users in order to improve question and answer posts, and allow users to learn from one another. In order to implement strategies that encourage cooperation, it is important to understand what influences the users in the network to cooperate. In this extended abstract, we investigate the social support principles that influence cooperation in Stack Overflow. Using a sample size of 282 Stack Overflow users, we develop and test a global research model using partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM). We further investigate any possible differences in the effect of these strategies between cultures, by testing two cultural subgroups; collectivist and individualist cultures. Our results show that social learning significantly influences cooperation in Stack Overflow at the global level. However, at the cultural subgroup level, recognition influences cooperation among collectivists, while social facilitation influences individualists to cooperate. These findings suggest possible design guidelines in the development of successful personalized Q&amp;A social networking sites that encourage participation through cooperation.},

We propose a novel approach that, given a context in the IDE, automatically retrieves pertinent discussions from Stack Overflow, evaluates their relevance, and, if a given confidence threshold is surpassed, notifies the developer about the available help. We have implemented our approach in Prompter, an Eclipse plug-in. Prompter has been evaluated through two studies.

In this context of collaboration, answers to question posts often undergo several edits to provide the best solution to the problem stated. In this work, we explore the potential of mining Stack Overflow answer edits to extract common patterns when answering a post. In particular, we design a similarity scheme that takes into account the text and code of answer edits and cluster edits according to their semantics. Upon applying our methodology, we provide frequent edit patterns and indicate how they could be used to answer future research questions. Assessing our approach indicates that it can be effective for identifying commonly applied edits, thus illustrating the transformation path from the initial answer to the optimal solution.},

abstract = {Question-and-answer (Q&amp;A) websites are one of the latest evolutions in crowdsourced knowledge aggregation. Q&amp;A websites provide more diverse opinions, as they involve the entire community. Quora made its reputation out of enhancing the traditional Q&amp;A model with popular aspects of social media and incites its users to provide their names, locations, and references. This model allows higher quality control - including anonymous content, but more importantly, it leads users to form communities based on other criteria (e.g. profession, city) than similar interests. In this paper, we study the interactions among Quorans to unveil how such communities emerge. We perform both quantitative and qualitative analysis on the user-generated content and relate this content to social and demographic features. We show that being anonymous significantly affects the answers' length and subjectivity. On the other hand, most of the user interactions relate to their geographic locations.},

abstract = {In modern code reviews, many artifacts play roles in knowledge- sharing and documentation: summaries, test plans, and comments, etc. Improving developer tools and facilitating better code reviews require an understanding of the quality of pull requests and their artifacts. This is difficult to measure, however, because they are often free-form natural language and unstructured text data. In this paper, we focus on measuring the quality of test plans at Meta. Test plans are used as a communication mechanism between the author of a pull request and its reviewers, serving as walkthroughs to help confirm that the changed code is behaving as expected. We collected developer opinions on over 650 test plans from more than 500 Meta developers, then introduced a transformer-based model to leverage the success of natural language processing (NLP) tech- niques in the code review domain. In our study, we show that the learned model is able to capture the sentiment of developers and reflect a correlation of test plan quality with review engagement and reversions: compared to a decision tree model, our proposed transformer-based model achieves a 7\% higher F1-score. Finally, we present a case study of how such a metric may be useful in experiments to inform improvements in developer tools and experiences.},

abstract = {Developers often search for relevant code examples on the web for their programming tasks. Unfortunately, they face two major problems. First, the search is impaired due to a lexical gap between their query (task description) and the information associated with the solution. Second, the retrieved solution may not be comprehensive, i.e., the code segment might miss a succinct explanation. These problems make the developers browse dozens of documents in order to synthesize an appropriate solution. To address these two problems, we propose CROKAGE (Crowd Knowledge Answer Generator), a tool that takes the description of a programming task (the query) and provides a comprehensive solution for the task. Our solutions contain not only relevant code examples but also their succinct explanations. Our proposed approach expands the task description with relevant API classes from Stack Overflow Q \&amp; A threads and then mitigates the lexical gap problems. Furthermore, we perform natural language processing on the top quality answers and then return such programming solutions containing code examples and code explanations unlike earlier studies. We evaluate our approach using 97 programming queries, of which 50\% was used for training and 50\% was used for testing, and show that it outperforms six baselines including the state-of-art by a statistically significant margin. Furthermore, our evaluation with 29 developers using 24 tasks (queries) confirms the superiority of CROKAGE over the state-of-art tool in terms of relevance of the suggested code examples, benefit of the code explanations and the overall solution quality (code + explanation).},

The 2020 Lab created a large new test collection and established strong baselines for both tasks.

abstract = {Programmers often rely on online resources—such as code examples, documentation, blogs, and Q&amp;A forums—to compare similar libraries and select the one most suitable for their own tasks and contexts. However, this comparison task is often done in an ad-hoc manner, which may result in suboptimal choices. Inspired by Analogical Learning and Variation Theory, we hypothesize that rendering many concept-annotated code examples from different libraries side-by-side can help programmers (1) develop a more comprehensive understanding of the libraries’ similarities and distinctions and (2) make more robust, appropriate library selections. We designed a novel interactive interface, ParaLib, and used it as a technical probe to explore to what extent many side-by-side concepted-annotated examples can facilitate the library comparison and selection process. A within-subjects user study with 20 programmers shows that, when using ParaLib, participants made more consistent, suitable library selections and provided more comprehensive summaries of libraries’ similarities and differences.},

abstract = {The intention of this article is to simplify the study of value co-creation both from a deeper theoretical discourse, including knowledge networks approach. The study's approach is from the perspective of knowledge sharing, in form of interaction and resource integration. We outline the central premises of value co-creation as fundamental in service ecosystems and resource integration concepts. It is also expounded how not just interaction, but how service interaction enhances value co-creating processes, by enabling an actor to enter the value creating processes of other parties, support them, and benefit from them. The article does emphasize processes of value co-creation, including its outputs and outcomes. Knowledge sharing is encapsulated within the concepts of resource integration and service interaction among actors. The knowledge network analysis technique is used as a methodology, while preliminary data from KAMOMI water supply service is used as a case illustration. The case is used to tentatively indicate how resource integration and interaction seem to influence value co-creation, while also using knowledge network analysis quantitatively. Two models are developed. The first model exemplified the theoretical drivers of value co-creation, while the second described the structural characteristics that influence value co-creation in form of knowledge sharing. Four propositions are advanced to supplement the study's theoretical insights. Given the perspectives of knowledge networks, the article makes knowledge contribution to the ongoing academic debate on value co-creation in service ecosystems.},

abstract = {People frequently come across unfamiliar tasks to complete in daily and professional life. A common strategy to accomplish such tasks is to refer to online How-To tutorials (e.g., wikiHow pages) and follow the instructions step-by-step. However, such archived tutorials are not always actionable, since the sequence of actions is pre-defined and could result in a discrepancy between what was shared and what people need in operational situations. Differing from regular conversational instruction-giving, where people are able to communicate instructions adaptively based on the ongoing working status, archived procedures lack such flexibility. As such, people may face actionability issues in which they may have difficulties navigating the instruction, making decisions on what to do, and solving problems. My dissertation explores system designs using chatbots to accompany novice users to improve the situational actionability and social acceptability of online tutorials for non-expert users. I present ActionaBot, an experimental platform for exploring human-chatbot collaborative instruction giving to augment online tutorials. By participating in the Doctoral Consortium, I am eager to receive feedback from experienced CSCW researchers to inform my research direction. In the long run, I aim to contribute a better understanding of how people and the chatbot may collaborate to enable actionable knowledge sharing and transfer at a large scale.},

abstract = {Community question answering (CQA) becomes increasingly prevalent in recent years, providing platforms for users with various backgrounds to obtain information and share knowledge. However, the redundancy and lengthiness issues of crowd-sourced answers limit the performance of answer selection, thus leading to difficulties in reading or even misunderstandings for community users. To solve these problems, we propose the dual graph question-answer attention networks (DGQAN) for answer selection task. Aims to fully understand the internal structure of the question and the corresponding answer, firstly, we construct a dual-CQA concept graph with graph convolution networks using the original question and answer text. Specifically, our CQA concept graph exploits the correlation information between question-answer pairs to construct two sub-graphs (QSubject-Answer and QBody-Answer), respectively. Further, a novel dual attention mechanism is incorporated to model both the internal and external semantic relations among questions and answers. More importantly, we conduct experiment to investigate the impact of each layer in the BERT model. The experimental results show that DGQAN model achieves state-of-the-art performance on three datasets (SemEval-2015, 2016, and 2017), outperforming all the baseline models.},

abstract = {Together with the development of Web 2.0 technology, we need to focus more on large-scale knowledge sharing. Owing to the characteristics of the long-tail distribution generally observed in conventional knowledge-sharing systems, knowledge providers are sometimes unwilling to share knowledge when they are unable to obtain any feedback. However, when knowledge acquirers read long-tail knowledge, they may easily feel bored because such knowledge rarely matches their own interests. To solve these problems, we proposed and implemented a gamified knowledge-sharing system called "Light Quest," which can share long-tail knowledge in an entertaining way. In this system, the users can briefly describe knowledge they would like to share using a "Tips Card," and evaluate the cards written by other users, by choosing the best card from a set of cards that are randomly selected from a knowledge pool. The results of a four-week experimental evaluation indicated that the system could increase users' motivation to both provide and acquire knowledge.},

Therefore, HCI design is a core issue when developing such systems. It often involves people with different backgrounds (e.g., Arts, Software Engineering, Design), which makes knowledge transfer a challenging issue. Ontologies have been acknowledged as a successful approach to represent domain knowledge and support knowledge-based solutions. Hence, in this work, we propose to explore ontologies to represent structured knowledge and improve knowledge sharing in HCI design. We briefly present the Human-Computer Interaction Design Ontology (HCIDO), a reference ontology that addresses HCI design aspects that connect HCI and Software Engineering concerns. By making knowledge related to the HCI design domain explicit and structured, HCIDO has helped us to develop KTID, a tool that aims to support capturing and sharing useful knowledge to aid in HCI design. Preliminary results indicate that the tool may be particularly useful for novice HCI designers.},

abstract = {Extra-institutional individuals are individuals who work outside of a bureaucracy. I argue that, in the absence of a bureaucracy organizing their work, the professional communication of extra-institutional individuals is organized by the problems they are trying to solve. Grouping extra-institutional individuals by the problems they are trying to solve instead of their field or area allows for deeper analysis of the communication needed in individual fields. The problems-based approach also allows comparison of extra-institutional individuals across fields, which can result in interdisciplinary knowledge sharing. This interdisciplinary knowledge sharing can help designers of communication to better understand their extra-institutional users and develop tools appropriate to the needs of audiences across fields with shared problems.},

abstract = {In this paper we introduce the micro-iterations pattern, along with two other supporting patterns - retrospectives in micro-iterations and learning in small groups. The patterns form a specific structure with particular types of activities for organizing workshops/hands-on learning sessions which are designed to aid teaching of complex topics in a more effective way. We expose how these patterns can achieve that through dividing complexity and deliberately employing proven and effective teaching techniques. We show that this way to structure teaching sessions is applicable to diverse types of subjects and has further benefits like lowering the barrier for people to become instructors and making continuous learning and improvement easy. This paper is for everyone engaged or planning to engage in teaching activities – from school and university teachers, private coaches to individuals engaged in knowledge sharing in various groups – companies or communities. We developed this pattern in a software development company context – however, the idea is applicable to many kinds of learning contexts and needs. We find that this pattern is also a good way to help aspiring teachers structure their first workshops.},

abstract = {Community Question Answering (CQA) is a popular online service for people asking and answering questions. Recently, with accumulation of users and contents in CQA platforms, their answer quality has aroused wide concern. Expert finding has been proposed as one way to address such problem, which aims at finding suitable answerers who can give high-quality answers. In this paper, we formalize expert finding as a learning to rank task by leveraging the user feedback on answers (i.e., the votes of answers) as the "relevance" labels. To achieve this task, we present a listwise learning to rank approach, which is referred to as ListEF. In the ListEF approach, realizing that questions in CQA are relatively short and usually attached with tags, we propose a tagword topic model (TTM) to derive high-quality topical representations of questions. Based on TTM, we develop a COmpetition-based User exPertise Extraction (COUPE) method to capture user expertise features for given questions. We adopt the widely used listwise learning to rank method LambdaMART to train the ranking function. Finally, for a given question, we rank candidate users in descending order of the scores calculated by the trained ranking function, and select the users with high rankings as candidate experts. Experimental results on Stack Overflow show both our TTM and ListEF approach are effective with significant improvements over state-of-art methods.},

The UK was the first country in the world to bring design into the policy spotlight, and the UK Design Council is also the longest running design council in the world. Since its establishment, the UK Design Council, as an entity platform between the British government, enterprises, design institutions and individual designers, education, scientific research and other fields, has effectively integrated many resources for the design field. This integration is mainly reflected in the following five aspects: establishing an industry image and cultivating a design ecology; integrating industrial resources and breaking through innovation bottlenecks; strengthening knowledge sharing and improving industrial skills; expanding social effects and creating multiple values; implementing interdisciplinary education and creating excellence center. Through more than 70&nbsp;years of continuous efforts, the UK Design Council has comprehensively promoted the construction and development of the British contemporary design ecology at the national macro-industrial level, make important contributions to the creative development of the British economic system. Through the study of the most important international design promotion organization in the 20th century, we can reveal the policy, method, path, effect, significance and value of design resource cooperation and design ecological construction promoted by the government, which can provide a practical reference for the development of design industry and creative economy theory and practice in various countries.},

abstract = {Quality assessment of data models can be a challenging task due to its subjective nature. For the schemaless, heterogeneous and diverse group of databases falling under the NoSQL umbrella, quality is generally operation and performance oriented, and no quality assessment framework exists. As a first step in shaping our understanding of NoSQL database model quality, this paper investigates the perceived usability of quality evaluation frameworks adopted from Entity Relationship (ER) modeling to the context of NoSQL databases. A first evaluation is performed on the three most widely used ER quality frameworks, where they are assessed for their usefulness, ease of use and suitability in the context of NoSQL databases. Based on the results of this assessment, a second evaluation is performed on the best scoring framework. This evaluation is comprised of a real use case adoption of the framework to assess the quality of NoSQL database models. This paper merges targeted crowdsourcing, Stack overflow data mining and white-box classification to gain insights into the concept of NoSQL database model quality, its characterizing features and the trade-offs it involves. This work illustrates the first investigation of ER-defined quality framework to NoSQL on a sample of diverse NoSQL schemas and using both industrial and academic participants. A decision tree is utilized to describe the heuristics of data model assessment, and an analysis is performed to identify inter-annotator disagreement, quality criterion importance, and quality trade-offs. In the absence of works approaching NoSQL data model quality assessment, this paper aims to lay groundwork and present preliminary insights on quality characterization in the context of NoSQL, as well as highlight current gaps, limitations and potential improvements.},

As is typical in the development of any system, modelers face similar challenges to classic software developers, whether with general modeling concepts or specific features of existing tools such as the Eclipse Modeling Framework. In this work, we aim to understand the issues that modelers face by analyzing discussions from Eclipse's modeling tool forums, MATLAB Central, and Stack Overflow. By performing a qualitative study using an open-coding process, we created a taxonomy of common issues faced by modelers. We considered both difficulty experienced when modeling a system and issues faced using existing modeling tools; these form the basis of our two research questions. Based on the taxonomy, we propose nine suggestions and enhancements, in three overarching groups, to improve the experience of modelers, at all levels of experience.},

abstract = {Stack Overflow (SO) has been a great source of natural language questions and their code solutions (i.e., question-code pairs), which are critical for many tasks including code retrieval and annotation. In most existing research, question-code pairs were collected heuristically and tend to have low quality. In this paper, we investigate a new problem of systematically mining question-code pairs from Stack Overflow (in contrast to heuristically collecting them). It is formulated as predicting whether or not a code snippet is a standalone solution to a question. We propose a novel Bi-View Hierarchical Neural Network which can capture both the programming content and the textual context of a code snippet (i.e., two views) to make a prediction. On two manually annotated datasets in Python and SQL domain, our framework substantially outperforms heuristic methods with at least 15\% higher F1 and accuracy. Furthermore, we present StaQC (Stack Overflow Question-Code pairs), the largest dataset to date of ~148K Python and ~120K SQL question-code pairs, automatically mined from SO using our framework. Under various case studies, we demonstrate that StaQC can greatly help develop data-hungry models for associating natural language with programming language},

In terms of job performance, it shows that tertius iungens orientation plays a mediating role in the relationship between knowledge-sharing activities and individual job performance. The results are expected to provide important theoretical and practical implications for researchers and practitioners respectively.},

Hyperlinks in discussion threads of Stack Overflow are essential knowledge entities for programming on the Web, such as a software library, an API documentation, a code example, or a tutorial. Tens of millions of hyperlinks are disseminated in Stack Overflow, while wisdom on what web resources have been highly recognized by the community is implicit in millions of discussion threads. In this paper, we develop the WisLinker framework that extracts knowledge from discussion, then turns knowledge into wisdom by learning through the knowledge dissemination history. With this wisdom, for a specific hyperlink that users are concerned with, WisLinker can recommend web resources highly recognized by the Stack Overflow community. We evaluate the validity of WisLinker in an open-ended setting using Stack Overflow data dump. We also implement a browser extension for live recommendation of web resources while users browse web pages. WisLinker could enable more efficient exploratory search and information discovery of programming-related web resources.},

abstract = {There are a large number of application program interfaces (APIs) on the Internet. Due to frequently updating APIs, programmers are prompted to frequently consult API documents in the process of software development. However, the traditional query approaches of the documents have certain limitations. For example, the programmers need to know the API name as a prerequisite and are often unable to obtain the expected search results because of the difference in understanding between the description of the problem and the description of the documents. Only these “known-unknown” information can be queried, and it is difficult to query the “unknown-unknown” information. To address the limitations, we establish the knowledge graph of software source code combined with knowledge which is derived from the documents, Github project code warehouse, Stack overflow platform, and local project code warehouse. Moreover, we propose a hybrid pattern knowledge graph-based API recommendation approach for programmers to complete the query task of unknown-unknown information. Finally, we constructed large-scale real experiments. Evaluation results prove that the proposed approach significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art approach.},

abstract = {Our work builds knowledge on gender-neutral hackathons in educational context. Hackathon itself is an intensive project-based event, requiring participants to make results in a short timeframe, which stimulates creative thinking, knowledge sharing, and overall learning. This has made hackathons popular in an educational context. As a hackathon event often implies software design, the introduction of hackathon practices would be especially beneficial for Software Engineering education. The question is how to attract a diverse student audience to enroll in these hackathon events and hackathon enhanced courses. Historically, hackathons attract fewer females than males and show gender balance issues. Even though there are positive examples of female-inclusive events, there is a risk that by focusing on women's interests, the hackathon designers could end up discouraging the male audience. It was found that men e.g., tend to reject feminine products and occupations as they experience social pressure regarding what is acceptable for them. Thus, it would be reasonable to focus on the hackathon's gender-neutrality rather than on female inclusivity. This research provides practices to implement hackathon courses gender-neutrally. We also discuss pros and cons of different approaches.},

abstract = {Opportunistic or Delay-tolerant networks (DTNs) may be used as a viable option for exchanging situational information during post-disaster communication in the absence of existing communication infrastructure. As opposed to traditional communication networks, situational information dissemination in DTNs depends on the degree of intermittent connectivity among the mobile nodes. Higher degree of connectivity implies smaller delay to disseminate situational information which results in better knowledge sharing. The degree of intermittent connectivity is influenced by mobility pattern of the nodes which is heterogeneous in nature. In this work, we attempt to formulate an empirical relationship between the degree of intermittent connectivity and extent of situational knowledge dissemination over DTNs in order to quantify the impact of the node mobility on the inter-shelter knowledge transfer In the absence of prior knowledge about the mobility patterns, we consider only the broad features of the impact. We introduce two metrics, Total Encounters and Knowledge Sharing Ratio. Total Encounters depends on node density, average movement speed of the nodes and elapsed time after initial node deployment. It serves as an indicator for estimating the degree of intermittent connectivity. The extent of situational information dissemination over an entire network is measured in terms of Knowledge Sharing Ratio. The relationship between Total Encounters and Knowledge Sharing Ratio is validated using the real mobility traces of volunteers captured from a field trial carried out in a disaster affected area. This analysis also helps us to formulate a suitable strategy for deployment of volunteer nodes in a post-disaster scenario.},

For developers, it is often not obvious from where a particular piece of information can be retrieved. To understand this documentation landscape, we systematically conducted Google searches for the elements of ten popular APIs. We found that their documentation is widely dispersed among many sources, that GitHub and Stack Overflow play a prominent role among the search results, and that most sources are quick to document new API functionalities. These findings inform API vendors about where developers find documentation about their products, they inform developers about places to look for documentation, and they enable researchers to further study the software documentation landscape.},

abstract = {The existing research on continual learning (CL) has focused mainly on preventing catastrophic forgetting. In the task-incremental learning setting of CL, several approaches have achieved excellent results, with almost no forgetting. The goal of this work is to endow such systems with the additional ability to transfer knowledge when the tasks are similar and have shared knowledge to achieve higher accuracy. Since the existing system HAT is one of most effective task-incremental learning algorithms, this paper extends HAT with the aim of both objectives, i.e., overcoming catastrophic forgetting and transferring knowledge among tasks without introducing additional mechanisms into the architecture of HAT. The current study finds that task similarity, which indicates knowledge sharing and transfer, can be computed via the clustering of task embeddings optimized by HAT. Thus, we propose a new approach, named “partially relaxed masks” (PRM), to exploit HAT’s masks to not only keep some parameters from being modified in learning subsequent tasks as much as possible to prevent forgetting but also enable remaining parameters to be updated to facilitate knowledge transfer. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PRM performs competitively compared with the latest baselines while also requiring much less computation time.},

abstract = {Software developers often resort to Stack Overflow (SO) to fill their programming needs. Given the abundance of relevant posts, navigating them and comparing different solutions is tedious and time-consuming. Recent work has proposed to automatically summarize SO posts to concise text to facilitate the navigation of SO posts. However, these techniques rely only on information retrieval methods or heuristics for text summarization, which is insufficient to handle the ambiguity and sophistication of natural language.This paper presents a deep learning based framework called Assort for SO post summarization. Assort includes two complementary learning methods, AssortS and AssortIS, to address the lack of labeled training data for SO post summarization. AssortS is designed to directly train a novel ensemble learning model with BERT embeddings and domain-specific features to account for the unique characteristics of SO posts. By contrast, AssortIS is designed to reuse pre-trained models while addressing the domain shift challenge when no training data is present (i.e., zero-shot learning). Both AssortS and AssortIS outperform six existing techniques by at least 13\% and 7\% respectively in terms of the F1 score. Furthermore, a human study shows that participants significantly preferred summaries generated by AssortS and AssortIS over the best baseline, while the preference difference between AssortS and AssortIS was small.},

We have reviewed the literature to explore how the use of interactive learning technologies can support learning in organizations to improve organizational culture by addressing dilemmas that employees might face in their work-life. Our work revealed that key concepts to achieve this are knowledge sharing, experiential learning, and learning at the individual, group, and organization levels. Furthermore, crowdsourcing is considered as a means of engaging and gathering the inputs and feedback from the employees using learning technologies. The main contribution of this paper is a conceptual framework that addresses a research gap in enhancing the support for reflection processes and organizational learning to improve organizational culture by applying the affordances of methods such as interactive learning technologies, planned group events, and crowdsourcing.},

These online platforms for collaborative development preserve a large amount of Software Engineering (SE) texts. These texts enable researchers to detect developers’ attitudes toward their daily development by analyzing the sentiments expressed in the texts. Unfortunately, recent works reported that neither off-the-shelf tools nor SE-specified tools for sentiment analysis on SE texts can provide satisfying and reliable results. In this paper, we propose to incorporate pre-trained transformer models into the sentence-classification oriented deep learning framework named TextCNN to better capture the unique expression of sentiments in SE texts. Specifically, we introduce an optimized BERT model named RoBERTa as the word embedding layer of TextCNN, along with additional residual connections between RoBERTa and TextCNN for better cooperation in our training framework. An empirical evaluation based on four datasets from different software information sites shows that our training framework can achieve overall better accuracy and generalizability than the four baselines.},

abstract = {Developing interactive systems is a challenging task that involves concerns related to the human-computer interaction (HCI), such as usability and user experience. Therefore, HCI design is a core issue to the quality of such systems. HCI design often involves people with different backgrounds (e.g., Arts, Software Engineering, Design). This makes knowledge transfer a challenging issue due to the lack of a common conceptualization about HCI design, leading to semantic interoperability problems, such as ambiguity and imprecision when interpreting shared information. Ontologies have been acknowledged as a successful approach to represent domain knowledge and support knowledge-based solutions. Hence, in this work, we propose to explore the use of ontologies to represent structured knowledge of HCI design and improve knowledge sharing in this context. We developed the Human-Computer Interaction Design Ontology (HCIDO), which is part of the Human-Computer Interaction Ontology Network (HCI-ON) and is connected to the Software Engineering Ontology Network (SEON). By making knowledge related to the HCI design domain explicit and structured, HCIDO helped us to develop KTID, a tool that aims to support capturing and sharing knowledge to aid in HCI design by allowing HCI designers to annotate information about design choices in design artifacts shared with HCI design stakeholders. Preliminary results indicate that the tool can be particularly useful for novice HCI designers.},

abstract = {Realizing driving safety is the fundamental goal pursued by artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled autonomous driving. However, due to the limited capacity of vehicles and the limited scenarios involved, the reliability and environmental adaptability of the current single-vehicle intelligence still need to be improved. In addition, driving knowledge only exists locally in each connected autonomous vehicle (CAV) and cannot be effectively reused or shared with other CAVs. To solve the above problems, this paper proposes to use federated learning (FL) to realize the collaboration of CAVs without revealing local data, thereby improving the accuracy of CAVs decision-making and driving safety. First, for the typical rear-end collision scenario, we propose a local decision-making model that comprehensively considers multiple influencing factors to fit the actual traffic environment. Then, we design a federated learning process for knowledge sharing. In particular, we propose a model similarity method to select high-quality local models for upload, thereby reducing communication overhead while improving the accuracy of the global model. Extensive simulations validate the performance of our proposal in reducing communication overhead and improving decision accuracy.},

abstract = {Although Reinforcement Learning (RL) has been successfully applied in traffic control, it suffers from the problems of high average vehicle travel time and slow convergence to optimized solutions. This is because, due to the scalability restriction, most existing RL-based methods focus on the optimization of individual intersections while the impact of their cooperation is neglected. Without taking all the correlated intersections as a whole into account, it is difficult to achieve global optimization goals for complex traffic scenarios. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel federated reinforcement learning approach named FedLight to enable optimal signal control policy generation for multi-intersection traffic scenarios. Inspired by federated learning, our approach supports knowledge sharing among RL agents, whose models are trained using decentralized traffic data at intersections. Based on such model-level collaborations, both the overall convergence rate and control quality can be significantly improved. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that compared with the state-of-the-art techniques, our approach can not only achieve better average vehicle travel time for various multi-intersection configurations, but also converge to optimal solutions much faster.},

abstract = {Developers frequently copy code snippets from publicly-available resources such as Stack Overflow (SO). While this may lead to a 'quick fix' for a development problem, little is known about how these copied code snippets affect the code quality of the recipient application, or how the quality of the recipient classes subsequently evolves over the time of the project. This has an impact on whether such code copying should be encouraged, and how classes that receive such code snippets should be monitored during evolution. To investigate this issue, we used instances from the SOTorrent database where Java snippets had been copied from Stack Overflow into GitHub projects. In each case, we measured the quality of the recipient class just prior to the addition of the snippet, immediately after the addition of the snippet, and at a later stage in the project. Our goal was to determine if the addition of the snippet caused quality to improve or deteriorate, and what the long-term implications were for the quality of the recipient class. Code quality was measured using the cohesion metrics Low-level Similarity-based Class Cohesion (LSCC) and Class Cohesion (CC). Over a random sample of 378 classes that received code snippets copied from Stack Overflow to GitHub, we found that in almost 70\% of the cases where the copied snippet affected cohesion, the effect was to reduce the cohesion of the recipient class. Furthermore, this deterioration in cohesion tends to persist in the subsequent evolution of recipient class. In over 70\% of cases the recipient class never fully regained the cohesion it lost in receiving the snippet. These results suggest that when copying code snippets from external repositories, more attention should be paid to integrating the code with the recipient class.},

abstract = {Platforms like Stack Overflow and GitHub's gist system promote the sharing of ideas and programming techniques via the distribution of code snippets designed to illustrate particular tasks. Python, a popular and fast-growing programming language, sees heavy use on both sites, with nearly one million questions asked on Stack Overflow and 400 thousand public gists on GitHub. Unfortunately, around 75\% of the Python example code shared through these sites cannot be directly executed. When run in a clean environment, over 50\% of public Python gists fail due to an import error for a missing library.We present DockerizeMe, a technique for inferring the dependencies needed to execute a Python code snippet without import error. DockerizeMe starts with offline knowledge acquisition of the resources and dependencies for popular Python packages from the Python Package Index (PyPI). It then builds Docker specifications using a graph-based inference procedure. Our inference procedure resolves import errors in 892 out of nearly 3,000 gists from the Gistable dataset for which Gistable's baseline approach could not find and install all dependencies.},

Prior examining this effect, the conceptualization of CA model is investigated. Based on a questionnaire survey from the Indonesian SMEs automotive component industry, the analysis is conducted using PLS-SEM two stage reflective-formative Hierarchical Component Model (HCM). By taking account the unique features of SMEs, we conceptualized CA of SMEs in eight constructs (collaborative commitment, collaborative efficiency agreement, collaborative risk sharing, collaborative planning, collaborative resource sharing, collaborative relational capital, collaborative information \&amp; knowledge sharing, collaborative synchronizing response) and further re-categorise it into three pillars (inter-firm trust, dynamic synchronization and resources investment). The empirical findings show that CA is positively and significantly affecting SMEs performance, and the effect is stronger when the firm's capability is taken into account. This study contributes to the theory of CA by reformulating the CA constructs that fit for SMEs to strengthen inter-firm trust building and to synchronize the firms' response on external factors change.},

abstract = {Usable and secure authentication on the web and beyond is mission-critical. While password-based authentication is still widespread, users have trouble dealing with potentially hundreds of online accounts and their passwords. Alternatives or extensions such as multi-factor authentication have their own challenges and find only limited adoption. Finding the right balance between security and usability is challenging for developers. Previous work found that developers use online resources to inform security decisions when writing code. Similar to other areas, lots of authentication advice for developers is available online, including blog posts, discussions on Stack Overflow, research papers, or guidelines by institutions like OWASP or NIST.We are the first to explore developer advice on authentication that affects usable security for end-users. Based on a survey with 18 professional web developers, we obtained 406 documents and qualitatively analyzed 272 contained pieces of advice in depth. We aim to understand the accessibility and quality of online advice and provide insights into how online advice might contribute to (in)secure and (un)usable authentication. We find that advice is scattered and that finding recommendable, consistent advice is a challenge for developers, among others. The most common advice is for password-based authentication, but little for more modern alternatives. Unfortunately, many pieces of advice are debatable (e.g., complex password policies), outdated (e.g., enforcing regular password changes), or contradicting and might lead to unusable or insecure authentication. Based on our findings, we make recommendations for developers, advice providers, official institutions, and academia on how to improve online advice for developers.},

abstract = {Deep Learning (DL) models to analyze source code have shown immense promise during the past few years.  
More recently, self-supervised pre-training has gained traction for learning generic code representations valuable for many downstream SE tasks, such as clone and bug detection.  

While previous work successfully learned from different code abstractions (e.g., token, AST, graph), we argue that it is also essential to factor in how developers code day-to-day for learning general-purpose representation. On the one hand, human developers tend to write repetitive programs referencing existing code snippets from the current codebase or online resources (e.g., Stack Overflow website) rather than implementing functions from scratch; such behaviors result in a vast number of code clones. In contrast, a deviant clone by mistake might trigger malicious program behaviors.  

Thus, as a proxy to incorporate developers' coding behavior into the pre-training scheme, we propose to include code clones and their deviants. In particular, we propose CONCORD, a self-supervised pre-training strategy to place benign clones closer in the representation space while moving deviants further apart. We show that CONCORD's clone-aware pre-training drastically reduces the need for expensive pre-training resources while improving the performance of downstream SE tasks. We also empirically demonstrate that CONCORD can improve existing pre-trained models to learn better representations that consequently become more efficient in both identifying semantically equivalent programs and differentiating buggy from non-buggy code.},

Knowledge sharing in online communities requires exerting time and effort and hence community members need motivation to contribute in these communities. Prior research identified numerous incentives that can motivate knowledge sharing in online communities such as self-efficacy and trust. However, research did not consider the effects of community types on the effectiveness of these incentives. In this paper we use meta-analysis to examine the effects of community type on knowledge sharing incentives in communities of interest and communities of practice. We examined 24 papers focusing on knowledge sharing incentives and we found that the type of online community moderates the effects of trust, commitment, task enjoyment and reciprocity on knowledge sharing. The outcome of this research demonstrates that future research should consider community types in knowledge sharing models.},

abstract = {Social theories suggest that individuals expect something in return when they decide to share knowledge. These expectations of benefits vary from tangible incentives provided by organizations to positive feelings aroused by altruistic behavior. The theory of consumption values (TCV) allows a specification of distinct types of benefits (functional, social, emotional, epistemic and conditional) which individuals consider before they decide to share knowledge. Furthermore, the perceived costs of sharing can reduce the perceived value of knowledge sharing. These costs are non-monetary sacrifices (effort and risks) reducing the perceived value of sharing. In this work we develop the perceived value of knowledge sharing as a multidimensional construct, grounded in assumptions of social exchange theory, consumer research and knowledge sharing literature. This conceptualization is intended to serve as a basis for the operationalization of perceived knowledge value in a future study on knowledge sharing intentions.},

In this sense, it was considered to take an approach oriented to improving processes to elaborate a proposal. As part of the proposal, it was identified that it would be necessary to facilitate a workshop with the stakeholders involved in these processes to work collaboratively. As a case study, a virtual workshop was held with the stakeholders (UX research specialists, HCI specialists, UX designers, and Developers) to obtain feedback and pain points of the AS-IS process and proposed improvement opportunities for the TO-BE process. With the participation of 5 specialists, 19 improvements were identified for the tree testing process (8 improvements for the virtual process and 11 improvements for the face-to-face process) and 18 improvements for the face-to-face process of heuristic evaluation. Given their experience in evaluations and user experience design, the participants could prioritize the high-impact improvements for the evaluation processes analyzed. Because of the results achieved, the inputs to propose the TO-BE process, as well as the feedback received during the facilitation of the workshop, and as well at the end, the team can affirm that the whole objectives of the workshop were achieved. Besides, we can affirm that the facilitation of remote workshops allows for obtaining valuable information from key actors. Finally, we affirm as well that remote workshops allow collaboration and knowledge sharing between the participants, despite the limitations of distance, and their non-physical presence.},

However, in online communities, such as Stack Overflow, this gender gap is even more extreme: only 5.8\% of contributors are female. In this paper, we use a mixed-methods approach to identify contribution barriers females face in online communities. Through 22 semi-structured interviews with a spectrum of female users ranging from non-contributors to a top 100 ranked user of all time, we identified 14 barriers preventing them from contributing to Stack Overflow. We then conducted a survey with 1470 female and male developers to confirm which barriers are gender related or general problems for everyone. Females ranked five barriers significantly higher than males. A few of these include doubts in the level of expertise needed to contribute, feeling overwhelmed when competing with a large number of users, and limited awareness of site features. Still, there were other barriers that equally impacted all Stack Overflow users or affected particular groups, such as industry programmers. Finally, we describe several implications that may encourage increased participation in the Stack Overflow community across genders and other demographics.},

abstract = {Routing newly posted questions (a.k.a cold questions) to potential answerers with the suitable expertise in Community Question Answering sites (CQAs) is an important and challenging task. The existing methods either focus only on embedding the graph structural information and are less effective for newly posted questions, or adopt manually engineered feature vectors that are not as representative as the graph embedding methods. Therefore, we propose to address the challenge of leveraging heterogeneous graph and textual information for cold question routing by designing an end-to-end framework that jointly learns CQA node embeddings and finds best answerers for cold questions. We conducted extensive experiments to confirm the usefulness of incorporating the textual information from question tags and demonstrate that an end-to-end framework can achieve promising performances on routing newly posted questions asked by both existing users and newly registered users.},

The results indicated that communities are actively thinking about employing social technologies for knowledge sharing, but several barriers exists that hinder adoption. The study indicated that any tool could build the community sense and replace the face-to-face meetings in real life, but the technologies should be intertwined with real life communication and every community needs a facilitator who takes responsibilities for community building.},

In this paper, we propose a novel question routing method from the viewpoint of knowledge graph embedding.

abstract = {Communities of Question Answering (CQAs) are rapidly growing communities for exchanging information in the form of questions and answers. They rely on the contributions of users (i.e., members of the community) who have appropriate domain knowledge and can provide helpful answers. In order to deliver the most appropriate and valuable answers, identification of such users (experts) is critically important. However, a common problem faced in CQAs is that of poor expertise matching, i.e., routing of questions to inappropriate users. In this paper, we focus on Stack Overflow (a programming CQA) and address this problem by proposing an embedding based approach that integrates users’ textual content obtained from the community (e.g., answers) and community feedback in a unified framework. Our embedding-based approach is used to find the best relevant users for a given question by computing the similarity between questions and our user expertise representation. Then, our framework exploits feedback from the community to rank the relevant users according to their expertise. We experimentally evaluate the performance of the proposed approach using Stack Overflow’s dataset, compare it with state-of-the-art models and demonstrate that it can produce better results than the alternative models.},

abstract = {The fundamental purpose of this study is to check the impact of six sigma on project success by introducing the knowledge and trust nexus for engineering projects. The sample size of the study is 235 respondents and data is collected from the engineering industries through convenience sampling technique. The data collected is then analyzed by applying the structural equation modeling (SEM) technique in Smart-PLS in order to examine the relationships among observed variables. The outcome confirms the sharing of knowledge within the employees is directly linked to the project success, which align with the previous studies. Moreover, sharing of knowledge will help the employee to more learning and enhance their performance to achieve the project goals and objectives which leads to the success of the project. The outcomes also demonstrate the moderating role of trust between the six sigma and knowledge sharing. The study is unique in its scope and implications as the focus is upon empirical investigation of the impact of application of six sigma on project success in the context of developing economy like Pakistan.},

abstract = {The popularity of machine learning has wildly expanded in recent years. Machine learning techniques have been heatedly studied in academia and applied in the industry to create business value. However, there is a lack of guidelines for code quality in machine learning applications. In particular, code smells have rarely been studied in this domain. Although machine learning code is usually integrated as a small part of an overarching system, it usually plays an important role in its core functionality. Hence ensuring code quality is quintessential to avoid issues in the long run. This paper proposes and identifies a list of 22 machine learning-specific code smells collected from various sources, including papers, grey literature, GitHub commits, and Stack Overflow posts. We pinpoint each smell with a description of its context, potential issues in the long run, and proposed solutions. In addition, we link them to their respective pipeline stage and the evidence from both academic and grey literature. The code smell catalog helps data scientists and developers produce and maintain high-quality machine learning application code.},

However, the contents of a Stack Overflow discussion are inherently heterogeneous, mixing natural language, source code, stack traces and configuration files in XML or JSON format.We constructed a full island grammar capable of modeling the set of 700,000 Stack Overflow discussions talking about Java, building a heterogeneous abstract syntax tree (H-AST) of each post (question, answer or comment) in a discussion. The resulting dataset models every Stack Overflow discussion, providing a full H-AST for each type of structured fragment (i.e., JSON, XML, Java, Stack traces), and complementing this information with a set of basic meta-information like term frequency to enable natural language analyses. Our dataset allows the end-user to perform combined analyses of the Stack Overflow by visiting the H-AST of a discussion.},

In this paper, we address an extractive summarization (i.e., headline extraction) task for such questions as a case study and consider how to alleviate the problem by using question-answer pairs, instead of missing-headline pairs. To this end, we propose a framework to examine how to use such unlabeled paired data from the viewpoint of training methods. Experimental results show that multi-task training performs well with undersampling and distant supervision.},

abstract = {A cloud federation (CF) is an alliance of cloud service providers (CSPs) working together to overcome scalability and portability barriers. However, there are some business challenges (e.g., lack of trust, lack of schemes for revenue sharing, and lack of schemes for resource sharing) and technological challenges (e.g., missing schemes for resource provisioning, lack of coordinated resource management, and little load balancing), causing instability in CFs. As CF alliances pursue strategic goals, they require intensive knowledge sharing. In fact, practitioners have confirmed a positive impact of knowledge management on stability and success of strategic alliances (SA). According to the literature, SAs may also face learning issues such as non–controlled information revelation or unbalanced dissemination of core competencies. These findings pose challenges about the nature of the knowledge and how to share it within a CF. Nonetheless, there is only scarce literature on KM in CF. Thus, the purpose of the paper is to propose a KM framework for CFs with the aim of strengthening stability and potential CF commercialization.},

abstract = {Community Question Answering (CQA) is a well-defined task that can be used in many scenarios, such as E-Commerce and online user community for special interests. In these communities, users can post articles, give comment, raise a question and answer it. These data form the heterogeneous information sources where each information source have their own special structure and context (comments attached to an article or related question with answers). Most of the CQA methods only incorporate articles or Wikipedia to extract knowledge and answer the user's question. However, various types of information sources in the community are not fully explored by these CQA methods and these multiple information sources (MIS) can provide more related knowledge to user's questions. Thus, we propose a question-aware heterogeneous graph transformer to incorporate the MIS in the user community to automatically generate the answer. To evaluate our proposed method, we conduct the experiments on two datasets: $textMSM ^textplus $ the modified version of benchmark dataset MS-MARCO and the AntQA dataset which is the first large-scale CQA dataset with four types of MIS. Extensive experiments on two datasets show that our model outperforms all the baselines in terms of all the metrics.},

abstract = {Loneliness threatens public mental wellbeing during COVID-19. In response, YouTube creators participated in the #StayHome #WithMe movement (SHWM) and made myriad videos for people experiencing loneliness or boredom at home. User-shared videos generate parasocial attachment and virtual connectedness. However, there is limited knowledge of how creators contributed videos during disasters to provide social provisions as disaster-relief. Grounded on Weiss’s loneliness theory, this work analyzed 1488 SHWM videos to examine video sharing as a pathway to social provisions. Findings suggested that skill and knowledge sharing, entertaining arts, homelife activities, live chatting, and gameplay were the most popular video styles. YouTubers utilized parasocial relationships to form a space for staying away from the disaster. SHWM YouTubers provided friend-like, mentor-like, and family-like provisions through videos in different styles. Family-like provisions led to the highest overall viewer engagement. Based on the findings, design implications for supporting viewers’ mental wellbeing in disasters are discussed.},

abstract = {With diverse product mixes in fabs, high demand volatility, and numerous manufacturing steps spread across different facilities, it is impossible to analyze the combined impacts of multiple operations in semiconductor supply chains without a modeling tool like simulation. This paper explains how ontologies can be used to develop and deploy simulation applications, with interoperability and knowledge sharing at the semantic level. This paper proposes a concept to automatically build simulations using ontologies and its preliminary results. The proposed approach seeks to save time and effort expended in recreating the information for different use cases that already exists elsewhere. The use case provides first indications that with an enhancement of a so-called Digital Reference with Semantic Web Technologies, modeling and simulation of semiconductor supply chains will not only become much faster but also require less modeling efforts because of the reusability property.},

abstract = {Question and answer (Q&amp;A) websites like Stack Overflow are one of the important sources of code examples in which developers can ask their questions and leave their answers about programming issues. Since the number of programmers who use these websites are increasing and a large number of questions and answers are being posted there by them, verifying the quality of all the answers and particularly the code snippets in them is impossible. Consequently, some code snippets might be of low quality and/or with faults. To mitigate this issue, we introduce ExRec (&lt;u&gt;Ex&lt;/u&gt;ample &lt;u&gt;Rec&lt;/u&gt;ommender), an Eclipse plugin with which programmers can contribute in improving the quality of code snippets in the answers to questions in the Stack Overow website. Using ExRec, a programmer can transfer a code snippet in the answer to a desired question in Stack Overow to her own program, apply her desired modifications to that code snippet, and then contribute the improved code snippet to Stack Overow as an answer to that particular question. Our evaluations of ExRec in a user study with 10 skilled programmers indicate that it is effective in practice and can help in improving the quality of code snippets in Stack Overow.},

In this paper, we develop and release a collection of 2,626 open-domain non-factoid questions from a diverse set of categories. The dataset, called ANTIQUE, contains 34k manual relevance annotations. The questions were asked by real users in a community question answering service, i.e., Yahoo! Answers. Relevance judgments for all the answers to each question were collected through crowdsourcing. To facilitate further research, we also include a brief analysis of the data as well as baseline results on both classical and neural IR models.},

When difficulties arise, home users and small-and-medium organizations might not always resort to a help desk. Alternatively, Question&amp;Answer platforms (e.g. Stack Overflow) come in handy. Unfortunately, we can not always expect home users to properly set good questions. However, examples can be a substitute for long explanations. This is particularly important for our target audience who might lack the skills to describe their needs in abstract terms, and hence, examples might be the easiest way to get the idea through. This sustains the effort to leverage existing spreadsheet tools with example-centric inline question posting. This paper describes such an effort for Google Sheets. The extension assists users in posing their example-based questions without leaving Google Sheets. These questions are next transparently channeled to Stack Overflow.},

abstract = {The EU’s proposed AI Act sets out a risk-based regulatory framework to govern the potential harms emanating from use of AI systems. Within the AI Act’s hierarchy of risks, the AI systems that are likely to incur “high-risk” to health, safety, and fundamental rights are subject to the majority of the Act’s provisions. To include uses of AI where fundamental rights are at stake, Annex III of the Act provides a list of applications wherein the conditions that shape high-risk AI are described. For high-risk AI systems, the AI Act places obligations on providers and users regarding use of AI systems and keeping appropriate documentation through the use of harmonised standards. In this paper, we analyse the clauses defining the criteria for high-risk AI in Annex III to simplify identification of potential high-risk uses of AI by making explicit the “core concepts” whose combination makes them high-risk. We use these core concepts to develop an open vocabulary for AI risks (VAIR) to represent and assist with AI risk assessments in a form that supports automation and integration. VAIR is intended to assist with identification and documentation of risks by providing a common vocabulary that facilitates knowledge sharing and interoperability between actors in the AI value chain. Given that the AI Act relies on harmonised standards for much of its compliance and enforcement regarding high-risk AI systems, we explore the implications of current international standardisation activities undertaken by ISO and emphasise the necessity of better risk and impact knowledge bases such as VAIR that can be integrated with audits and investigations to simplify the AI Act’s application.},

abstract = {On Stack Overflow, more than 38,000 diverse tags are used to classify posts. The Stack Overflow community provides tag synonyms to reduce the number of tags that have the same or similar meaning. In our previous research, we used those synonym pairs to derive a number of strategies to create tag synonyms automatically.In this work, we continue this line of research and present an approach to group tag synonyms to meaningful topics. We represent our synonyms as directed, weighted graphs, and investigate several graph community detection algorithms to build meaningful groups of tags, also called tag communities.We apply our approach to the tags obtained from Android-related Stack Overflow posts and evaluate the resulting tag communities quantitatively with various community metrics. In addition, we evaluate our approach qualitatively through a manual inspection and comparison of a random sample of tag communities. Our results show that we can cluster the Android tags to 2,481 meaningful tag communities. We also show how these tag communities can be used to derive trends of topics of Android-related questions on Stack Overflow.},

Objective: This study aims at empirically studying the key motivators, practices, and drawbacks of artifact-based knowledge sharing for achieving common understanding of technical specifications in the context of GSD. Method: We conducted an exploratory case study in an organization that was involved in several GSD projects. Results: Our findings revealed the key challenges that necessitated the use of artifacts for sharing technical specification knowledge. We also present the practices that make up the artifact-based knowledge sharing system in the studied case. Finally, we shed some light on the caveats of knowledge sharing practices adopted by the studied company. The findings can provide useful insights into the artifact-based knowledge sharing practices and how it can be complemented by having certain level of social ties among distributed team members, even through asynchronous means.},

Intense trainings and knowledge sharing not necessarily lead to expected behavioral results. Is there a gap between what people know and what they do? This paper investigates ways for understanding and closing this gap. It reviews the literature related to innovation diffusion and technology acceptance. Based on that, it develops a Knowledge Behavior Gap model, containing four main constructs: knowledge, acceptance, intention, and behavior. To validate the model, a quantitative survey instrument was designed. Using it, eighty-three valid responses were collected. Partial least squares structural equation modeling method was used to analyze the data and test the model. The results demonstrate a strong and significant path from knowledge to behavior that leads through acceptance and intention. Interestingly, the paths from knowledge to acceptance and from intention to behavior both get even stronger with age. Meaning that for older people knowledge is a more powerful predictor of acceptance and intention is a more seriously influencing behavior. As the main contribution to science and practice, the model provides a more consistent way for measuring and predicting the success of envisioned organizational and societal changes. Thus, researchers are encouraged to advance Knowledge Behavior Gap model, while professionals are invited to apply it for enhancing desired transformations towards hyper-performance.},

abstract = {Question \&amp; answer (Q&amp;A) websites, such as Stack Overflow (SO), are widely used by developers to find and provide answers to technical issues and concerns in software development. Mobile development is not an exception to the rule. In the latest SO dump, more than 400K questions were labeled with tags related to mobile technologies. Although, previous works have analyzed the main topics and trends in SO threads, there are no studies devoted specifically to mobile development. In this paper we used topic modeling techniques to extract hot-topics from mobile-development related questions. Our findings suggest that most of the questions include topics related to general questions and compatibility issues, and the most specific topics, such as crash reports and database connection, are present in a reduced set of questions.},

So far, research has focused on the ML libraries to find and mitigate these challenges. However, there is initial evidence that programming languages also add to the challenges, identifiable in different distributions of bugs in ML programs. To fill this research gap, we propose the first empirical study on the impact of programming languages on bugs in ML programs. We plan to analyze software from GitHub and related discussions in GitHub issues and Stack Overflow for bug distributions in ML programs, aiming to identify correlations with the chosen programming language, its features and the application domain. This study's results enable better-targeted use of available programming language technology in ML programs, preventing bugs, reducing errors and speeding up development.},

abstract = {Long-distance human-robot collaborative tasks require robust forms of knowledge-sharing among agents in order to optimize the performance of the task. In this paper, we propose to take advantage of the proliferation of mobile phones to use them as a reliable low-cost communication interface, as opposed to the use of specific gadgets or speech and gesture recognition techniques that are highly prone to failure in the presence of noise or occlusions. Our interface is focused on search tasks, and it allows the user to share with other agents real-time information such as their position, their intention or even what they would like the other agents to do. To test its acceptability, a user study was conducted with 20 volunteers in a human-human scenario. A second round of experiments with other 30 volunteers was conducted to test different ways to encourage user interaction with our interface. Finally, real-life experiments were also conducted with a robot to apply learned knowledge to the desired scenario. We found a statistically significant improvement in the amount of information exchanged between agents.},

However, little prior information retrieval research has considered how people use search tools and information resources to support their creative stages. To gain a better understanding of how and why users interact with information resources and tools during a creative process, we conducted a two-week diary study with 11 participants. We recorded their information seeking behavior through a combination of diary entries, data logging, and reflective interviews. Our analysis identified five common reasons for how people use existing information resources (e.g., search engines, video sites, image sites, Q&amp;A sites, and other social sites) to support their creative process. We also report on how different information resources were preferred for different purposes at different creative stages. For instance, participants often used images to help support ideation, Q&amp;A sites to learn from other creators and to find tips and recommendations, and social media to select ideas and collect feedback on their creative projects. We also identified challenges participants faced when working on their creative projects. Our findings provide insights for the future design of search engines, improvement of search algorithms, and the development of novel tools to support users during different creative stages.},

abstract = {In software engineering, energy awareness refers to the conscious design and development of software that is able to monitor and react to energy state. Energy awareness is the key building block for energy efficiency and for other quality aspects of robotics software, such as mission completion time and safety. However, as of today, there is no guidance for practitioners and researchers on how to architect robotics software with energy awareness in mind. The goal of this paper is to identify architectural tactics for energy-aware robotics software. Specifically, using a dataset of 339493 data points extracted from five complementary data sources (e.g., source code repositories, Stack Overflow),  we identified and analyzed 97 data points that considered both energy consumption and architectural concerns. We then synthesized a set of energy-aware architectural tactics via thematic analysis. In this preliminary investigation we focus on two representative architectural tactics.},

abstract = {A positive working climate is essential in modern software development. It enhances productivity since a satisfied developer tends to deliver better results. Sentiment analysis tools are a means to analyze and classify textual communication between developers according to the polarity of the statements. Most of these tools deliver promising results when used with test data from the domain they are developed for (e.g., GitHub). But the tools’ outcomes lack reliability when used in a different domain (e.g., Stack Overflow). One possible way to mitigate this problem is to combine different tools trained in different domains. In this paper, we analyze a combination of three sentiment analysis tools in a voting classifier according to their reliability and performance. The tools are trained and evaluated using five already existing polarity data sets (e.g. from GitHub). The results indicate that this kind of combination of tools is a good choice in the within-platform setting. However, a majority vote does not necessarily lead to better results when applying in cross-platform domains. In most cases, the best individual tool in the ensemble is preferable. This is mainly due to the often large difference in performance of the individual tools, even on the same data set. However, this may also be due to the different annotated data sets.},

Our CMPPN is pre-trained on a large scale code corpus with code summarization task based on transformer, and incorporated with copying mechanism in the fine-tuning phase. To evaluate our proposed model, we create a new dataset based on Stack Overflow posts, which contains code snippets, programming error messages and corresponding question headlines in 3 programming languages (Java, C# and Python). Extensive experimental results on this dataset verify the effectiveness of our CMPPN compared to baseline methods. Both dataset and model are available on .},

abstract = {The utilization of digital knowledge management systems (KMS) to improve learning is a conventional trend in modern day computer science. These systems facilitate knowledge creation, sharing, and implementation of various pedagogical approaches including collaboration tasks. In situations where traditional learning scenarios are not possible, collaborative tools and platforms are used for providing immersive learning experiences. As it is known, collaboration has become a core competency of modern education, and an indispensable tool employed in the information technology sector. There exist different forms of knowledge management systems with different architecture. This leads to one system facilitating one form of pedagogy over the other. On the one hand, collaborative pedagogical approaches in digital learning can aid knowledge sharing, question asking, with which a feedback is expected without time and space constraints. Certain mechanisms in some KMS architectures such as Topic Maps emphasizes on the findalibility of information, which in turn could promote collaborative pedagogy. This paper discusses the development of a collaborative knowledge blog with some topic map implementation. It investigates the role of digital collaborative learning in scientific knowledge acquisition. We assessed students’ ease of learning and analyzed their engagement while utilizing the system. Results indicate that the students showed deeper engagement and improved in their scientific understanding over time which reinforces the importance of collaborative activities as observed in literature.},

abstract = {The growing shortage of skilled workers and the large number of employees from the 1960s so-called baby boom generation who will be retiring in the next few years are current and growing major challenges for companies in Germany. When people retire, companies can lose a lot of valuable know-how and experience. Experienced professionals enjoy a special status in companies because of their extensive and in-depth knowledge of work processes. Salaries and positions in companies are often linked to knowledge. The fear of losing status or even financial loss by sharing knowledge can be a reason for employees to keep their knowledge to themselves. The use of new technologies such as artificial intelligence in companies can also trigger several fears among employees like fears regarding job loss, new skill requirements or surveillance. An innovative work culture, where knowledge sharing is actively encouraged, required and rewarded, is not successfully implemented everywhere. A particular challenge in the KI_eeper project is to convince experienced employees in the participating organizations of the importance of sharing and preserving knowledge to ensure the company's long-term competitiveness. The aim is to encourage them to provide their knowledge to other employees with the help of an AI assistance system. In addition to the development of an assistance system, an important task of the project is the development of methods promoting knowledge transfer and contributing to the acceptance of the use of the new technology. Information and awareness-raising workshops with managers and employees have been designed and tested in the companies. Employees are involved in the development of the system in a participatory approach. This ensures that the system can be developed in a user- and needs-oriented manner and thus the acceptance of the system's use in future everyday work can be promoted, which is crucial for long-term successful application.},

This can introduce a better class dynamic, where “knowledge skills” (Eng. professional knowledge) will be shared and a better social environment to be created, resulting in an increase in satisfaction and motivation among IT-students, where we had access to two classes (DMU – Eng. Computer Science AP course, MMD – Eng. Multimedia designer AP course). During our research, we designed a survey that was distributed four times, during the period of three months. The result is combined into an excel sheet and measured with the average. We get an overview of the general population's response. The research design was in two stages, where the first part was to measure their response to pair-programming (PP) teamwork, with shuffling, and the second part was to test the effect of converting to Mob Programming (MP) groups. The result of these four surveys indicated that during the PP, the motivation and knowledge sharing started to decrease with time, however, when changing to MP there was a renewed motivational effect which started to increase motivation for their study. However, this is mainly true for the class of DMU, the other class of MMD had a slower response to the change of going from PP to MP. During the research, we also see Tuckman’s model of stages of group development in action, which is more profound with the DMU class than with the MMD class.},

However, the corporation still faces many difficulties to share knowledge because of many social factors such as corporate social responsibility. In this paper, a cause-effect model is established to analyze the relationship between corporation social responsibility and efficiency of knowledge sharing by middle variables (i.e. corporate leadership and reputation). And then, Based on social network, a threshold model is constructed to explore how the corporate social responsibility affects the efficiency of knowledge sharing. The simulation results confirm that the corporate social responsibility will indirectly affect the knowledge sharing efficiency through corporate leadership and reputation. There is a significant positive correlation between them. This provides a new perspective to study the non-technical factors which lead to dilemma of knowledge sharing. Surely, it will be helpful for us to deeply understand how the corporate social responsibility impacts the corporate performance.},

abstract = {Large-scale multi-modal contrastive pre-training has demonstrated great utility to learn transferable features for a range of downstream tasks by mapping multiple modalities into a shared embedding space. Typically, this has employed separate encoders for each modality. However, recent work suggests that transformers can support learning across multiple modalities and allow knowledge sharing. Inspired by this, we investigate a variety of Modality-Shared Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (MS-CLIP) frameworks. More specifically, we question how many parameters of a transformer model can be shared across modalities during contrastive pre-training, and rigorously examine architectural design choices that position the proportion of parameters shared along a spectrum. In studied conditions, we observe that a mostly unified encoder for vision and language signals outperforms all other variations that separate more parameters. Additionally, we find that light-weight modality-specific parallel modules further improve performance. Experimental results show that the proposed MS-CLIP approach outperforms vanilla CLIP by up to 13\% relative in zero-shot ImageNet classification (pre-trained on YFCC-100M), while simultaneously supporting a reduction of parameters. In addition, our approach outperforms vanilla CLIP by 1.6 points in linear probing on a collection of 24 downstream vision tasks. Furthermore, we discover that sharing parameters leads to semantic concepts from different modalities being encoded more closely in the embedding space, facilitating the transferring of common semantic structure (e.g., attention patterns) from language to vision.

abstract = {The Internet's naming system (DNS) is a hierarchically structured database, with hundreds of millions of domains in a radically distributed management architecture. The distributed nature of the DNS is the primary factor that allowed it to scale to its current size, but it also brings security and stability risks. The Internet standards community (IETF) has published several operational best practices to improve DNS resilience, but operators must make their own decisions that tradeoff security, cost, and complexity. Since these decisions can impact the security of billions of Internet users, recently ICANN has proposed an initiative to codify best practices into a set of global norms to improve security: the Knowledge-Sharing and Instantiating Norms for DNS and Naming Security (KINDNS) [4]. A similar effort for routing security - Mutually Agreed Norms for Routing Security - provided inspiration for this effort. The MANRS program encourages operators to voluntarily commit to a set of practices that will improve collective routing security - a challenge when incentives to conform with these practices does not generate a clear return on investment for operators. One challenge for both initiatives is independent verification of conformance with the practices. The KINDNS conversation has just started, and stakeholders are still debating what should be in the set of practices.

abstract = {To accelerate the learning process of technical resources by developers, organizations such as Amazon, Google, and Microsoft have been provided and maintained the so-called code samples. Code samples are special software projects made available in public repositories with the main goal of teaching and clarifying developers’ doubts related to the use of frameworks, libraries, or other technical resources. Since code samples are software projects themselves, they change over time. If these changes do not preserve essential characteristics of code samples such as size and code simplicity throughout evolution, they may lose their usefulness and can be another source of questions. We investigated the evolution of code samples as well as whether and how it may raise questions from the developers about the code samples themselves. In this way, we analyzed the evolution of 186 code samples provided by Android, AWS, Azure, Spring Boot, and Spring Cloud, assessing metrics related to the size and complexity of over 15,184 commits. We also explored more than 1,500 developers’ questions in Stack Overflow to understand the relation between these questions and code samples’ evolution. We observed that organizations may not be preserving key characteristics of code samples during evolution. Our analysis also indicates that some untamed metrics are related to a rise of questions about code samples.},

abstract = {When software defects occur, developers begin the debugging process by formulating hypotheses to explain the cause. These hypotheses guide the investigation process, determining which evidence developers gather to accept or reject the hypothesis, such as parts of the code and program state developers examine. However, existing debugging techniques do not offer support in finding relevant hypotheses, leading to wasted time testing hypotheses and examining code that ultimately does not lead to a fix. To address this issue, we introduce a new type of debugging tool, the hypothesis-based debugger, and an implementation of this tool in Hypothesizer. Hypothesis-based debuggers support developers from the beginning of the debugging process by finding relevant hypotheses until the defect is fixed. To debug using Hypothesizer, developers first demonstrate the defect, generating a recording of the program behavior with code execution, user interface events, network communications, and user interface changes. Based on this information and the developer’s descriptions of the symptoms, Hypothesizer finds relevant hypotheses, analyzes the code to identify relevant evidence to test the hypothesis, and generates an investigation plan through a timeline view. This summarizes all evidence items related to the hypothesis, indicates whether the hypothesis is likely to be true by showing which evidence items were confirmed in the recording, and enables the developer to quickly check evidence in the recording by viewing code snippets for each evidence item. A randomized controlled experiment with 16 professional developers found that, compared to traditional debugging tools and techniques such as breakpoint debuggers and Stack Overflow, Hypothesizer dramatically improved the success rate of fixing defects by a factor of five and decreased the time to debug by a factor of three.},

abstract = {In the field of neurosurgery, a variety of knowledge has been accumulated through a lot of surgery experiences. Due to the difficulty of expression, not all of the points that skilled neurosurgeons pay attention to during neurosurgery and the detailed precautions and procedures obtained from experience have been clearly stated and shared. Postoperative reports, incident reports, and accident reports are effective means of recording and sharing empirical knowledge, but they are costly to analyze. So, new methods of knowledge sharing are needed. In this study, we propose an interface based on Virtual Reality as a new interface. In order to construct a virtual reality interface, we utilize the VR Head Mounted Display. By projecting a model of a human head made by 3D Computer Graphics technology in a virtual reality space, we can grasp the structure more accurately. It is also possible to see at the same time the empirical knowledge that neurosurgeons accumulate through surgery while confirming the surgical procedure. The VR Head Mounted Display makes the experience more immersive. In addition, Head Mounted Display has been put into practical use, and its operating functions have been improved. Therefore, it is easy to operate and can be used as an interface for recording according to neural medical ontology. In order to accumulate and share the empirical knowledge of neurosurgeons, we investigated a 3D brain model interface using Virtual Reality.},

Does the persistent presence of some key contributors among the most productive members improve or not the quality of the knowledge, considered in the aggregate? The present paper considers these issues by correlating week-by-week value changes in contribution unevenness, elite resilience (stickiness), and content quality. The goal is to detect if and how changes in social structural variables may influence the quality of the knowledge produced by online knowledge production sites. The paper addresses such question by an extensive data analysis carried out on the datasets of two representative sites: Wikipedia and Stack Overflow. Results from the analysis show that on Stack Overflow both unevenness and elite stickiness have a curvilinear effect on quality. Quality is optimized at specific levels of elite stickiness and unevenness. At the same time, on Wikipedia, quality increases linearly with a decline on entropy, overall, and with an increase in stickiness in the maturation phase, after an entropy peak is reached.},

Since elite developers play critical roles in most OSS projects, investigating their behaviors at the ecosystem level becomes urgent. Thus, we aim to investigate elite developers' activities and their relationships with project outcomes (productivity and quality). We design an large scale empirical study which characterizes elite developers' activity profiles and identifies the relationships between their effort allocations and project outcomes across five ecosystems. Our current results and findings reveal that elite developers in each ecosystem do behave in ecosystem-specific ways. Further, we find that the elites' effort allocations on different activity categories are potentially correlated with project outcomes.},

abstract = {Uncertain Capacitated Arc Routing Problem (UCARP) is an NP-hard optimisation problem with many applications in logistics domains. Genetic Programming (GP) is capable of evolving routing policies to handle the uncertain environment of UCARP. There are many different but related UCARP domains in the real world to be solved (e.g. winter gritting and waste collection for different cities). Instead of training a routing policy for each of them, we can use the multi-task learning paradigm to improve the training effectiveness by sharing the common knowledge among the related UCARP domains. Previous studies showed that GP population for solving UCARP loses diversity during its evolution, which decreases the effectiveness of knowledge sharing. To address this issue, in this work we propose a novel multi-task GP approach that takes the uniqueness of transferable knowledge, as well as its quality, into consideration. Additionally, the transferred knowledge is utilised in a manner that improves diversity. We investigated the performance of the proposed method with several experimental studies and demonstrated that the designed knowledge transfer mechanism can significantly improve the performance of GP for solving UCARP.},

The method extracts semantic and statistical features from question text. After that, a feature set generation method is proposed, along with a model fusion strategy.

To solve these challenges, we design an approach, which assists developers with understanding and debugging data processing in Spark. Our approach leverages statistical sampling to minimize performance overhead, and provides intermediate information and hint messages for each data processing step of a chained method pipeline.

abstract = {Developers often reuse code snippets from online forums, such as Stack Overflow, to learn API usages of software frameworks or libraries. These code snippets often contain ambiguous undeclared external references. Such external references make it difficult to learn and use those APIs correctly. In particular, reusing code snippets containing such ambiguous undeclared external references requires significant manual efforts and expertise to resolve them. Manually resolving fully qualified names (FQN) of API elements is a non-trivial task. In this paper, we propose a novel context-sensitive technique, called COSTER, to resolve FQNs of API elements in such code snippets. The proposed technique collects locally specific source code elements as well as globally related tokens as the context of FQNs, calculates likelihood scores, and builds an occurrence likelihood dictionary (OLD). Given an API element as a query, COSTER captures the context of the query API element, matches that with the FQNs of API elements stored in the OLD, and rank those matched FQNs leveraging three different scores: likelihood, context similarity, and name similarity scores. Evaluation with more than 600K code examples collected from GitHub and two different Stack Overflow datasets shows that our proposed technique improves precision by 4-6\% and recall by 3-22\% compared to state-of-the-art techniques. The proposed technique significantly reduces the training time compared to the StatType, a state-of-the-art technique, without sacrificing accuracy. Extensive analyses on results demonstrate the robustness of the proposed technique.},

Consumer apps that collect health data are becoming more popular, but raise new privacy concerns as they collect unnecessary data, share it with third parties, and track users. However, developers of these apps are not necessarily knowingly endangering users’ privacy; some may simply face challenges working with health features. To scope these challenges, we qualitatively analyzed 269 privacy-related posts on Stack Overflow by developers of health apps for Android- and iOS-based systems. We found that health-specific access control structures (e.g., enhanced requirements for permissions and authentication) underlie several privacy-related challenges developers face. The specific nature of problems often differed between the platforms, for example additional verification steps for Android developers, or confusing feedback about incorrectly formulated permission scopes for iOS. Developers also face problems introduced by third-party libraries. Official documentation plays a key part in understanding privacy requirements, but in some cases, may itself cause confusion. We discuss implications of our findings and propose ways to improve developers’ experience of working with health-related features—and consequently to improve the privacy of their apps’ end users.},

abstract = {The exponential rise of deep learning, aided by the availability of several frameworks and specialized hardware, has led to its application in a wide variety of domains. The availability of GPUs has made it easier to train networks with a huge number of parameters. However, this rise has come at the expense of ever-increasing energy requirements and carbon footprint. While the existing work tries to combat this issue by proposing optimizations in the hardware and the neural network architectures, there is an absence of general energy efficiency guidelines for deep learning developers. In this paper, we propose an initial catalog of 8 energy patterns for developing deep learning applications by analyzing 1361 posts from Stack Overflow. Our hope is that these energy patterns may help the developers adopt energy efficient practices in their deep learning projects. A survey with 14 deep learning developers showed us that the developers are largely in agreement with the usefulness of the catalog from an energy efficiency perspective. A detailed description of the catalog, along with the posts related to each energy pattern, is available at the following link: https://rishalab.github.io/dl_energy_patterns/},

One option for scaffolding collaboration in CQA systems is a recommendation of new questions to users who are suitable candidates for providing correct answers (so called question routing). Various methods have been proposed so far to find appropriate answerers, but almost all approaches heavily depend on previous users' activities in a particular CQA system (i.e. QA-data). In our work, we attempt to involve a whole community including users with no or minimal previous activity (e.g. newcomers or lurkers). We proposed a question routing method which analyses users' non-QA data from a CQA system itself as well as from external services and platforms, such as blogs, microblogs or social networking sites, in order to estimate users' interests and expertise early and more precisely. Consequently, we can recommend new questions to a wider part of a community as well as more accurately. Evaluation on a dataset from Stack Exchange platform showed that considering non-QA data leads not only to better recognition of users with low activity as suitable answerers, but also to higher overall precision of the recommendations. It implies that non-QA data can supplement QA data during expertise estimation in question routing and thus also improve a success rate of a questions answering process.},

abstract = {How-to tutorials and videos are valuable for self-learning. While it is common for task instructors to produce tutorials alone, sharing knowledge when performing physical tasks without external support can be challenging to the experts. The resulting tutorials may also appear incomprehensible to learners who are not involved in the process of tutorial generation. We investigate cued-knowledge sharing, which pairs instructors with partners of different levels of expertise who also participate tutorial generation and give cues (prompts, questions etc.) to the instructors to facilitate their knowledge externalization. In a laboratory study, experienced cooks performed a cooking task and think aloud with cues from three types of paired partners, another experienced cook, a novice cook, or no partner. We noted that experts produced more clarifications when being paired with novice-partners than experienced-partners. The results demonstrate that (1) having a partner participate and provide cues may influence the content of knowledge sharing, and (2) even if the partner doesn't know much about the task (i.e., novice), their external cues remain helpful, which shed light on developing intelligent support for instructors' tutorial generation in the procedural and physical domains.},

abstract = {In Community Question Answering (CQA) websites, expert finding aims at seeking suitable experts to answer questions. The key is to explore the inherent relevance based on the representations of questions and experts. Existing methods usually learn these features from single view information (e.g., question title), which would be not insufficient to fully learn their representations. In this paper, we propose a personalized expert finding method with a multi-view attentive matching mechanism. We design three modules under the multi-view paradigm, including a question encoder, an intra-view encoder, and an inter-view encoder, which aims to comprehend the comprehensive relationships between experts and questions. In the question encoder, we learn the multi-view question features from its title, body and tag views respectively. In the intra-view encoder, we design an interactive attention network to capture the view-specific relevance between the target question and the historical answered questions of experts for all different views. Furthermore, in the inter-view encoder we employ a personalized attention network to aggregate different view information to learn expert/question representations. In this way, the match of the expert and question could be fully captured from the multi-view information via the intra- and inter-view mechanisms. Experimental results on six datasets demonstrate that the proposed method could achieve better performance than existing state-of-the-art methods.},

Besides being useful for software developers, these annotated snippets can potentially serve as the basis for automated tools that provide working code solutions to specific natural language queries.With the goal of developing automated tools with the Stack Overflow snippets and surrounding text, this paper investigates the following questions: (1) How usable are the Stack Overflow code snippets? and (2) When using text search engines for matching on the natural language questions and answers around the snippets, what percentage of the top results contain usable code snippets?A total of 3M code snippets are analyzed across four languages: C#, Java, JavaScript, and Python. Python and JavaScript proved to be the languages for which the most code snippets are usable. Conversely, Java and C# proved to be the languages with the lowest usability rate. Further qualitative analysis on usable Python snippets shows the characteristics of the answers that solve the original question. Finally, we use Google search to investigate the alignment of usability and the natural language annotations around code snippets, and explore how to make snippets in Stack Overflow an adequate base for future automatic program generation.},

To address this question, we combine interviews, analysis of trace data from SO and SO-PT and a survey of 229 Brazilian software developers. Our results indicate that the developers recognize availability of the information, response speed and accessibility as strong points of SO, and lower barrier to entry and presence of Brazilian-specific information as strong points of SO-PT. In large, SO remains more popular than SO-PT, and SO-PT is not perceived as a viable alternative to SO.},

abstract = {Group interactions are prevalent in various complex systems (e.g., collaborations of researchers and group discussions on online Q&amp;A sites), and they are commonly modeled as hypergraphs. Hyperedges, which compose a hypergraph, are non-empty subsets of any number of nodes, and thus each hyperedge naturally represents a group interaction among entities. The higher-order nature of hypergraphs brings about unique structural properties that have not been considered in ordinary pairwise graphs.In this tutorial, we offer a comprehensive overview of a new research topic called hypergraph mining. We first present recently revealed structural properties of real-world hypergraphs, including (a) static and dynamic patterns, (b) global and local patterns, and (c) connectivity and overlapping patterns. Together with the patterns, we describe advanced data mining tools used for their discovery. Lastly, we introduce simple yet realistic hypergraph generative models that provide an explanation of the structural properties.

abstract = {Developers can use different technologies for many software development tasks in their work. However, when faced with several technologies with comparable functionalities, it is not easy for developers to select the most appropriate one, as comparisons among technologies are time-consuming by trial and error. Instead, developers can resort to expert articles, read official documents or ask questions in QA sites for technology comparison, but it is opportunistic to get a comprehensive comparison as online information is often fragmented or contradictory. To overcome these limitations, we propose the diffTech system that exploits the crowdsourced discussions from Stack Overflow, and assists technology comparison with an informative summary of different comparison aspects. We first build a large database of comparable technologies in software engineering by mining tags in Stack Overflow, and then locate comparative sentences about comparable technologies with natural language processing methods. We further mine prominent comparison aspects by clustering similar comparative sentences and representing each cluster with its keywords. The evaluation demonstrates both the accuracy and usefulness of our model and we implement our approach into a practical website for public use.},

abstract = {While classic aspect-based sentiment analysis typically includes three sub-tasks (aspect extraction, opinion extraction, and aspect-level sentiment classification), recent studies focus on exploring possibilities of knowledge sharing from different tasks, such as document-level sentiment analysis or document-level domain classification that are less demanding on dataset resources. Several recent studies managed to propose different frameworks for solving nearly complete end-to-end aspect-based sentiment analysis in a unified manner. However, none of them studied the possibility of transferring knowledge about their subjectivity or opinion typology between sub-tasks. In this work, we propose subjectivity-aware learning as a novel auxiliary task for aspect-based sentiment analysis. Besides, we also propose another novel task defined as opinion type detection. We performed extensive experiments on the state-of-the-art dataset that show improvement of model performance while employing subjectivity learning. All models report improvement in overall F1 score for aspect-based sentiment analysis. In addition, we also set new benchmark results for the separate task of subjectivity detection and opinion type detection for the restaurant domain of SemEval 2015 dataset.},

In recent years, with the rapid development of such online platforms, an enormous amount of archive data has accumulated, it becomes more and more difficult for expert users to identify desirable questions. In order to reduce the proportion of unanswered questions in CQA, facilitate expert users to find the questions they are interested in, question classification becomes an important task of CQA, which aims to assign a newly posted question to a specific preset category. In this paper, we propose a novel question answering attention network (QAAN) for investigating the role of the paired answer of questions for classification. Specifically, QAAN studies the correlation between question and paired answer, taking the questions as the primary part of the question representation, and the answer information is aggregated based on similarity and disparity with the answer. Our experiment is implemented on Yahoo! Answers dataset. The results show that QAAN outperforms all the baseline models.},

Based on a development set of 1,574 sentences, we compare the performance of two state-of-the-art summarization techniques as well as a pattern-based approach for insight sentence extraction. We then present SISE, a novel machine learning based approach that uses as features the sentences themselves, their formatting, their question, their answer, and their authors as well as part-of-speech tags and the similarity of a sentence to the corresponding API documentation. With SISE, we were able to achieve a precision of 0.64 and a coverage of 0.7 on the development set. In a comparative study with eight software developers, we found that SISE resulted in the highest number of sentences that were considered to add useful information not found in the API documentation. These results indicate that taking into account the meta data available on Stack Overflow as well as part-of-speech tags can significantly improve unsupervised extraction approaches when applied to Stack Overflow data.},

abstract = {Stack Overflow is an enormously popular question-and-answer web site intended for software developers to help each other with programming issues. Some software projects aimed at developers (for example, application programming interfaces, application engines, cloud services, development frameworks, and the like) are closing their self-supported developer discussion forums and mailing lists and instead directing developers to use special-purpose tags on Stack Overflow. The goals of this paper are to document the main reasons given for moving developer support to Stack Overflow, and then to collect and analyze data from a group of software projects that have done this, in order to show whether the expected quality of support was actually achieved. The analysis shows that for all four software projects in this study, two of the desired quality indicators, developer participation and response time, did show improvements on Stack Overflow as compared to mailing lists and forums. However, we also found several projects that moved back from Stack Overflow, despite achieving these desired improvements. The results of this study are applicable to a wide variety of software projects that provide developer support using social media.},

abstract = {This paper investigates how developers discuss code smells and anti-patterns over Stack Overflow to understand better their perceptions and understanding of these two concepts. Understanding developers' perceptions of these issues are important in order to inform and align future research efforts and direct tools vendors in the area of code smells and anti-patterns. In addition, such insights could lead the creation of solutions to code smells and anti-patterns that are better fit to the realities developers face in practice. We applied both quantitative and qualitative techniques to analyse discussions containing terms associated with code smells and anti-patterns. Our findings show that developers widely use Stack Overflow to ask for general assessments of code smells or anti-patterns, instead of asking for particular refactoring solutions. An interesting finding is that developers very often ask their peers 'to smell their code' (i.e., ask whether their own code 'smells' or not), and thus, utilize Stack Overflow as an informal, crowd-based code smell/anti-pattern detector. We conjecture that the crowd-based detection approach considers contextual factors, and thus, tends to be more trusted by developers over automated detection tools. We also found that developers often discuss the downsides of implementing specific design patterns, and 'flag' them as potential anti-patterns to be avoided. Conversely, we found discussions on why some anti-patterns previously considered harmful should not be flagged as anti-patterns. Our results suggest that there is a need for: 1) more context-based evaluations of code smells and anti-patterns, and 2) better guidelines for making trade-offs when applying design patterns or eliminating smells/anti-patterns in industry.},

abstract = {Compilers primarily give feedback about problems to developers through the use of error messages. Unfortunately, developers routinely find these messages to be confusing and unhelpful. In this paper, we postulate that because error messages present poor explanations, theories of explanation---such as Toulmin's model of argument---can be applied to improve their quality. To understand how compilers should present explanations to developers, we conducted a comparative evaluation with 68 professional software developers and an empirical study of compiler error messages found in Stack Overflow questions across seven different programming languages.  Our findings suggest that, given a pair of error messages, developers significantly prefer the error message that employs proper argument structure over a deficient argument structure when neither offers a resolution---but will accept a deficient argument structure if it provides a resolution to the problem. Human-authored explanations on Stack Overflow converge to one of the three argument structures: those that provide a resolution to the error, simple arguments, and extended arguments that provide additional evidence for the problem. Finally, we contribute three practical design principles to inform the design and evaluation of compiler error messages.},

abstract = {The programming language Julia is designed to solve the 'two language problem', where developers who write scientific software can achieve desired performance, without sacrificing productivity. Since its inception in 2012, developers who have been using other programming languages have transitioned to Julia. A systematic investigation of the questions that developers ask about Julia can help in understanding the challenges that developers face while using Julia. Such understanding can be helpful (i) for toolsmiths who can construct tools so that developers can maximize their experience of using Julia, and (ii) for Julia language maintainers with empirical evidence on areas to improve the language as well as the Julia ecosystem. We conduct an empirical study with 3,093 Stack Overflow posts where we identify 13 categories of questions related to Julia-based software development. We observe developers to ask about a diverse set of topics, such as GC, Julia's garbage collector, JuMP, a domain-specific language constructed using Julia, and symbols, a metaprogramming utility in Julia. Based on our emerging results, we recommend enhancing support for developers with Julia-based tools and techniques for cross language transfer, type-related assistance, and package resolution.},

abstract = {With the increasingly prevailing usage of Information and Communication technologies (ICT) in collaborative learning, students can cooperate with others online easily, in spite of the restriction of time and location. Social loafing, a common phenomenon in collaborative work, has negative effect on team performance, especially on the individual's knowledge sharing behavior. In recent years, there are also some researches pointing out that social loafing is a kind of hidden and unobservable behavior. In this study, we propose a research model based on the stimulus-organism-response (S-O-R) framework and build a hidden Markov model (HMM) to infer the student's unobservable social loafing state. We collect real world behavior data from an online collaborative course from Nov 11th 2016 to Dec 21th 2016.The dataset includes more than 1200 knowledge sharing records from 150 students on Slack. Our research is expected to contribute in both academic study and managerial implications on how to set up a collaborative team.},

abstract = {Nowadays, software development is accelerated through the reuse of code snippets found online in question-answering platforms and software repositories. In order to be efficient, this process requires forming an appropriate query and identifying the most suitable code snippet, which can sometimes be challenging and particularly time-consuming. Over the last years, several code recommendation systems have been developed to offer a solution to this problem. Nevertheless, most of them recommend API calls or sequences instead of reusable code snippets. Furthermore, they do not employ architectures advanced enough to exploit the semantics of natural language and code in order to form the optimal query from the question posed. To overcome these issues, we propose CodeTransformer, a code recommendation system that provides useful, reusable code snippets extracted from open-source GitHub repositories. By employing a neural network architecture that comprises advanced attention mechanisms, our system effectively understands and models natural language queries and code snippets in a joint vector space. Upon evaluating CodeTransformer quantitatively against a similar system and qualitatively using a dataset from Stack Overflow, we conclude that our approach can recommend useful and reusable snippets to developers.},

In particular, this study focuses on the dimension of employee oriented vs work oriented culture, which captures the extent to which the organization emphasizes care for employee well-being vs care for employee performance. Through analyses of a field survey of 207 professionals from more than 10 firms in both private and the government sectors, several hypotheses were confirmed. First, higher employee oriented culture predicted increased knowledge sharing behaviour, and this effect was mediated by increased endorsement of organizational knowledge sharing norms. Second, these effects were particularly strong among highly educated employees-that is, among those likely to have knowledge-and skill-intensive occupations. The results suggest that organisational cultures that value employee well-being may foster social norms and attitudes that are conducive to knowledge sharing behaviour, and that this effect may be particularly pronounced in workplaces that require high levels of education.},

abstract = {Global knowledge has become a central issue for an organization's survival. In the last few decades, Web technologies have become widely used for Knowledge Management; these are called Knowledge Management Systems (KMS). Recently, in Knowledge Management (KM) the effectiveness of knowledge sharing has been considered a significant component for KMS success. In the most universities the KM is often inadequate when it comes to knowledge sharing, especially between academics. In order to encourage knowledge sharing, it is important to know why/where/when academics choose to contribute or to receive shared knowledge. Therefore, the purpose of this research is to investigate the factors that affect an academics' behavior towards knowledge sharing by using technology. Knowledge Sharing Technology model (KST) is proposed model was constructed combining the affecting factors: these factors are a synthesis of factors which already exist in current theories, i.e. the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) and Social Exchange Model (SET), as well as other factors which are always explored independently in research studies The future work will focus on confirming the model.},

abstract = {Recently questioning and answering (Q&amp;A) communities that facilitate knowledge sharing among people have been introduced to the mobile environments such as Naver Mobile Q&amp;A and ChaCha. These mobile Q&amp;A services are very different from traditional Q&amp;A sites in that questions/answers are short in length and are exchanged via mobile devices (e.g., SMS or mobile Internet). While traditional Q&amp;A sites have been well investigated, so far little is known about the mobile Q&amp;A usage. To understand mobile Q&amp;A usage, we analyzed 2.4 million question/answer pairs spanning a 14 month period from Naver Mobile Q&amp;A and performed a complementary survey study of 555 active mobile Q&amp;A users. We find that mobile Q&amp;A is deeply wired into users' everyday life activities - its usage is largely dependent on users' spatial, temporal, and social contexts; the key factors of mobile Q&amp;A usage are accessibility/convenience of mobile Q&amp;A, promptness of receiving answers, and users' satisficing behavior of information seeking (i.e., minimizing efforts and settling with good enough information). We also observe that users tend to seek more factual information attributed to everyday life activities than they do on traditional Q&amp;A sites and that they exhibit unique interaction patterns such as repeating and refining questions as coping strategies in seeking information needs. Our main findings reported in the paper have significant implications on the design of mobile Q&amp;A systems.},

abstract = {Stack Overflow is one of the most popular online programming question and answer websites for developers around the world. Generally, developers need to provide tags for their posting. High-quality tags are expected to facilitate correct classification and efficient search. Unfortunately, tagging process is distributed and uncoordinated due to developers' understanding of their postings, English skills and preferences. Automatic tag recommendation becomes increasingly important for these information sites. In this paper, we propose SOTagRec, a novel tag recommendation approach combing convolutional neural network model and collaborative filtering method. By learning historical postings and their tags from existing information, SOTagRec can accurately infer tags for new postings. We have evaluated SOTagRec on Stackoverflow and compare with the state-of-the-art methods. Experiments Results show that SOTagRec achieves 81.7\% and 88.7\% respectively for Recall@5 and Recall@10, which outperforms the previous relevant methods.},

abstract = {Community question answering (CQA) becomes more and more popular in both academy and industry recently. However, a large number of answers often amass in question-answering communities. Hence, it is almost impossible for users to view item by item and select the most relevant one. As a result, answer selection becomes a very significant subtask of CQA. Hence, we propose question-answer dual attention fusion networks with the pre-trained model (BRETDAN) for the task of answer selection. Specifically, we apply BERT model, which has achieved a better result in GLUE leaderboard with deep transformer architectures as the encoder layer to do fine-tuning for question subjects, question bodies and answers, respectively, then the cross attention mechanism selecting out the most relevant answer for different questions. Finally, we apply dual attention fusion networks to filter the noise caused by introducing question and answer pairs. Specifically, the cross attention mechanism aims to extract interactive information between question subject and answer. In a similar way, the interactive information between question body and answer is also captured. Dual attention fusion aims to address the noise problem in the question and answer pairs. Experiments show that the BERTDAN model achieves significant performance on two datasets: SemEval-2015 and SemEval-2017, outperforming all baseline models.},

abstract = {Research studies are increasingly critical of publicly available code due to evidence of faults. This has led researchers to explore ways to improve such code, with static analysis and genetic code improvement previously singled out. Previous work has evaluated the feasibility of these techniques, using PMD (a static analysis tool) and GIN (a program repair tool) for enhancing Stack Overflow Java code snippets. Results reported in this regard pointed to the potential of these techniques, especially in terms of GIN's removal of PMD's performance faults from 58 programs. We use a contextual lens to explore these mutations in this study, to evaluate the promise of these techniques. The outcomes show that while the programs were syntactically correct after GIN's mutations (i.e., they compiled), many of GIN's mutations changed the semantics of the code, rendering its purpose questionable. However, certain code mutations tend to retain code semantics more than others. In addition, GIN's mutations at times affected PMD's parsing ability, potentially increasing false negatives. Overall, while these approaches may prove useful, full utility may not be claimed at this time. For enhancing the outcomes of these approaches, we outline ways to improve the utility of these techniques and multiple future research directions.},

By drawing upon social capital theory, this study presents a knowledge sharing climate. This study also shows how interdisciplinary knowledge integration mediates between functional diversity and innovation and between a knowledge-sharing climate and innovation. Data collected from 202 individuals from interdisciplinary project teams were used to test the research model. Empirical results indicate that innovation is significantly affected by interdisciplinary knowledge integration and openness. Functional diversity and trusting relationships do not have direct impacts on innovation but are mediated by interdisciplinary knowledge integration. The findings have critical theoretical and practical implications which are discussed in the paper.},

Studies indicate that sentiment analysis tools provide unreliable results when used out-of-the-box, since they are not designed to process SE datasets. The silver bullet for a successful application of sentiment analysis tools to SE datasets might be their customization to the specific usage context.We describe our experience in building a software library recommender exploiting developers' opinions mined from Stack Overflow. To reach our goal, we retrained---on a set of 40k manually labeled sentences/words extracted from Stack Overflow---a state-of-the-art sentiment analysis tool exploiting deep learning. Despite such an effort- and time-consuming training process, the results were negative. We changed our focus and performed a thorough investigation of the accuracy of commonly used tools to identify the sentiment of SE related texts. Meanwhile, we also studied the impact of different datasets on tool performance. Our results should warn the research community about the strong limitations of current sentiment analysis tools.},

abstract = {The Stack Overflow web site is an online community where programmers can ask and answer one another's questions, earning points and badges. The site offers guidance in the form of a Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ), beginning with "What kind of questions can I ask here?" The answer explains that "the best Stack Overflow questions have a bit of source code in them". This paper explores the role of source code and non-source code text on Stack Overflow in both questions and answers. The primary contribution of this paper is to provide a more detailed understanding of whether the presence of source code (and how much) actually will produce the "best" Stack Overflow questions or answers. A second contribution of this paper is to determine how the non-code portions of the text might also contribute the "best" Stack Overflow postings.},

We focused on i) WebGL, a key low-level JavaScript (JS) API used to render 3D graphics in browsers without plugins, and ii) Three.js, a higher level JS library that reuses WebGL and is reputed easier and more intuitive. We considered questions from SO tagged with WebGL or Three.js and extracted all tags used on these questions. Using these, we were able to compare the relative attention (considering the number of questions and views) and support (considering satisfactory answers and how long they take) received by concerns and technologies associated to WebGL and Three.js. Our results suggest that Three.js gets significantly more community attention but less community support than WebGL on SO.},

Thus, the challenge to keep these platforms noise-free is attracting the interest of research community. Stack Overflow is one such popular computer programming related Q&amp;A platform. The established users on Stack Overflow have learnt the acceptable format and scope of questions in due course. Even if their questions get closed, they are aware of the required edits, therefore the chances of their questions being reopened increases. On the other hand, non-established users have not adapted to the Stack Overflow system and find difficulty in editing their closed questions. In this work, we aim to identify features which help differentiate editing approaches of established and non-established users, and motivate the need of recommendation model. Such a recommendation model can assist every user to edit their closed questions leveraging the edit-style of the established users of the platform.},

abstract = {Partial code usually involves non-fully-qualified type names (non-FQNs) and undeclared receiving objects. Resolving the FQNs of these non-FQN types and undeclared receiving objects (referred to as type inference) is the prerequisite to effective search and reuse of partial code. Existing dictionary-lookup based methods build a symbolic knowledge base of API names and code contexts, which involve significant compilation overhead and are sensitive to unseen API names and code context variations. In this paper, we formulate type inference as a cloze-style fill-in-blank language task. Built on source code naturalness, our approach fine-tunes a code masked language model (MLM) as a neural knowledge base of code elements with a novel “pre-train, prompt and predict” paradigm from raw source code. Our approach is lightweight and has minimum requirements on code compilation. Unlike existing symbolic name and context matching for type inference, our prompt-tuned code MLM packs FQN syntax and usage in its parameters and supports fuzzy neural type inference. We systematically evaluate our approach on a large amount of source code from GitHub and Stack Overflow. Our results confirm the effectiveness of our approach design and the practicality for partial code type inference. As the first of its kind, our neural type inference method opens the door to many innovative ways of using partial code.},

Usually they cause an unexpected and wrong output or behavior because of an incorrect usage of an API (Application Programming Interface). We propose an approach to find fixes for API-usage-related bugs, which is based on matching snippets being debugged against related snippets in a Q&amp;A website (Stack Overflow). We analyzed real code excerpts from OHLOH Code Search containing API method calls that may lead to API-usage-related bugs depending on how they are used by developers. We conducted a study with these excerpts to verify to what extent the proposed approach provides proper information from Stack Overflow to fix these potential API-usage-related bugs. The results are encouraging: 66.67\% of Java excerpts with potential API-usage-related bugs had their fixes found in the top-10 query results. Considering JavaScript excerpts, fixes were found in the top-10 results for 40\% of them. These results indicate that our approaches (i.e., lsab-java and lsab-js combined with the keyword filter) outperform Google and Stack Overflow in searching for API-usage-related bug fixes.},

We developed a questionnaire to support deeper understanding of user experiences with knowledge sharing activities. The results reveal that there are several challenging issues biologists encounter when using bioinformatics resources. A much smaller number of biologists have engaged in passive knowledge sharing within their research fields than we had expected. However, most biologists expressed their willingness to share their own knowledge with others. This result reinforces the need for more user-centered design approaches for supporting knowledge-sharing in rapidly emerging fields of data-intensive science. At the same time, our results suggest that more work is needed to examine how to best motivate users to further engage and contribute knowledge in online scientific communities.},

abstract = {During the last few years, Continuous Integration (CI) has become a common practice in open-source and industrial environments to reduce the scope for errors and increase the speed to market through the automated build and test processes. However, despite this wide adoption throughout the years, little is known about the challenges developers discuss. Analyzing the discussions of developers is required to understand what researchers, educators and practitioners should focus on, and how discussion communities can be helpful to shed the light on CI challenges. In this study, we examine Stack Overflow (SO), the most popular crowd-sourced forum, to understand the challenges developers face in the CI context. We collect a corpus of 27,728 CI-related developers posts from SO and analyze those posts through a mixed method with quantitative and qualitative analyzes. To study the trends of CI discussions, we investigated the metadata of CI questions, users and tags. Then, we extract the CI main topics using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) tuned with Genetic Algorithm (GA). Finally, we investigate the most popular and difficult topics faced by developers based on unanswered questions to get further insights into CI challenges. The LDA clustering reveals that developers face challenges with six main topics namely Build, Testing, Version Control, Configuration, Deployment, and CI Culture. Particularly, we found that the build topic is the most popular among the studied topics and that version control and testing topics are the most difficult for the SO community. Our study uncovers insights about CI challenges and adds evidence to existing knowledge about CI issues related especially to software build.},

abstract = {As technology scaling is approaching its physical limit, lithography hotspot detection has become an essential task in design for manufacturability. Although the deployment of machine learning in hotspot detection is found to save significant simulation time, such methods typically demand non-trivial quality data to build the model. While most design houses are actually short of quality data, they are also unwilling to directly share such layout related data to build a unified model due to the concerns on IP protection and model effectiveness. On the other hand, with data homogeneity and insufficiency within each design house, the locally trained models can be easily over-fitted, losing generalization ability and robustness when applying to the new designs. In this paper, we propose a heterogeneous federated learning framework for lithography hotspot detection that can address the aforementioned issues. The framework can build a more robust centralized global sub-model through heterogeneous knowledge sharing while keeping local data private. Then the global sub-model can be combined with a local submodel to better adapt to local data heterogeneity. The experimental results show that the proposed framework can overcome the challenge of non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data and heterogeneous communication to achieve very high performance in comparison to other state-of-the-art methods while guaranteeing good convergence in various scenarios.},

The Internet of Things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) are providing remarkable technological innovations on fish farming. In this research, we present an automated IoT and AI-based system to improve fish farming. The proposed system uses multiple sensors to measure in real-time water quality chemical parameters such as: temperature, pH, turbidity, electrical conductivity, total dissolved solids, etc., from the fish pond and send them on a cloud database to allow fish farmers to access them in realtime with their devices (mobile phone, PC, tablets). The system contains three web applications which fish farmers can use. The first web application enables farmers with realtime visualizations of sensors data, issues alerts and remote pumps controls. Fish farmers can use the second web application for fish disease detection and to receive suggestions for diseases' care. This would help to classify two fish diseases which are: Epizootic Ulcerative Syndrome(EUS), and Ichthyophthirus(Ich). The third web application is a digital community platform for knowledge sharing, capacity building, market opportunities and collaboration among fish farmers. Our system can help reduce human efforts, reinforce capacity building, increase fish production and market opportunities for fish farmers.},

In order to understand what is being discussed by the microservice community, this work has applied mining techniques and topic modelling to a manually-curated dataset of 1,043 microservice-related posts from StackOverflow. As a result, we found that 13.68\% of microservice technical posts on SO discuss a single technology: Netflix Eureka. Moreover, buzzwords in the microservice ecosystem, e.g., blue/green deployment, were not identified as relevant subjects of discussion on SO. Finally, we show how a high discussion rate on SO may not reflect the popularity of a certain subject within the microservice community.},

abstract = {The amount of diverse tags used to classify posts on Stack Overflow increased in the last years to more than 38,000 tags. Many of these tags have the same or similar meaning. Stack Overflow provides an approach to reduce the amount of tags by allowing privileged users to manually create synonyms. However, currently exist only 2,765 synonym-pairs on Stack Overflow that is quite low compared to the total number of tags.To comprehend how synonym-pairs are built, we manually analyzed the tags and how the synonyms could be created automatically. Based on our findings, we then present TSST, a tag synonym suggestion tool, that outputs a ranked list of possible synonyms for each input tag.We first evaluated TSST with the 2,765 approved synonym-pairs of Stack Overflow. For 88.4\% of the tags TSST finds the correct synonyms, for 72.2\% the correct synonym is within the top 10 suggestions. In addition, we applied TSST to 10 randomly selected Android related tags and evaluated the suggested synonyms with 20 Android app developers in an online survey. Overall, in 80\% of their ratings, developers found an adequate synonym suggested by TSST.},

The expertise of answerers under already replied question tags is intuitively discounted by accounting for the observed tags, votes and temporal information of their answers. Instead, the discounted expertise under not yet replied tags is predicted via a latent-factor representation of both answerers and tags. These representations are inferred by means of Gibbs sampling under a new Bayesian probabilistic model of discounted user expertise and asking-answering behavior. The devised model unprecedentedly explains the latter two CQA aspects as the result of a generative process, that seamlessly integrates probabilistic matrix factorization and network behavior characterization. An extensive comparative experimentation over real-world CQA data demonstrates that our approach outperforms several-state-of-the-art competitors in recommendation effectiveness.},

abstract = {As software-intensive digital systems become an integral part of modern life, ensuring that these systems are developed to satisfy security and privacy requirements is an increasingly important societal concern. This paper examines how secure coding practice is supported on Stack Overflow. Although there are indications that on-line environments are not robust or accurate sources of security information, they are used by large numbers of developers. Findings demonstrate that developers use conversation within the site to actively connect with and tend to security problems, fostering knowledge, exchanging information and providing assistance to one another.},

abstract = {In this digital era, the textual content has become a seemingly ubiquitous part of our life. Natural Language Processing (NLP) empowers machines to comprehend the intricacies of textual data and eases human-computer interaction. Advancement in language modeling, continual learning, availability of a large amount of linguistic data, and large-scale computational power have made it feasible to train models for downstream tasks related to text analysis, including safety-critical ones, e.g., medical, airlines, etc. Compared to other deep learning (DL) models, NLP-based models are widely reused for various tasks. However, the reuse of pre-trained models in a new setting is still a complex task due to the limitations of the training dataset, model structure, specification, usage, etc. With this motivation, we study BERT, a vastly used language model (LM), from the direction of reusing in the code. We mined 80 posts from Stack Overflow related to BERT and found 4 types of bugs observed in clients’ code. Our results show that 13.75\% are fairness, 28.75\% are parameter, 15\% are token, and 16.25\% are version-related bugs.},

Knowledge synergy made by cross-functional expert teams is sometimes introduced as a method for bridging this gap, which helps to realize rapid knowledge transfer and effective knowledge sharing, and furtherly increase the knowledge accumulation of related organizations in light of knowledge assimilation. This paper, which is hereby unfolded based on the theory of knowledge synergy, intends to a conduct study of its complexity and evaluation on knowledge synergistic effect of cross-functional teams. Specifically, after conducting complexity analysis on the synergy effect, the cooperative relationship between the subjects is selected as a point for penetration and then evaluate the level of knowledge synergistic effect by using a two-tuple linguistic method. Such a manner not merely reveals the main source of knowledge synergistic effect of cross-functional expert team, but better accord with its features of cross-functional expert team, which presents telling advantages concerning the operability and scientificity of evaluation method.},

abstract = {Large organizations often constrain their innovation quests only inside the silos of dedicated departments. However, in the rapidly changing world, innovation processes need to be opened to wider circles suggesting involving virtual environments in workplaces that trigger employees’ to be highly engaged. This empirical study investigates the facilitation of knowledge sharing in large organizations and the effect of gamification elements on the perceived level of engagement of users. The case study takes place in one of the largest banks in the Scandinavian countries, Nordea bank. The case study involves an innovation platform (i.e., a virtual place where the employees can share their ideas) within two variations: a conventional and a gamified one. Despite the contradiction between the results from the quantitative approach and the qualitative one, the outcome of this study suggests that in large organizations, there is a potential of opening up the innovation processes and make employees more engaged.},

abstract = {In any cybersecurity training program, a non-marginal fraction of the activities are usually devoted to ”hands-on” practice, typically in the form of vulnerable scenarios that the trainee must evaluate/penetrate. The manual setup and implementation of such training scenarios is a significant burden on trainers, and takes away valuable time. In order to automate this step and enable reuse of components or even entire scenarios, this paper proposes Nautilus, a Cyber Range with extended capabilities that at the same time provides a training environment and a ”marketplace” platform to share scenarios, pre-implemented vulnerabilities/CVEs, scripts, etc. Nautilus leverages advanced cloud technologies to semi-automate deployment of vulnerable configurations of virtualized networks and systems, provides a graphical interface and a scenario description language, and integrates easy-to-use data/knowledge sharing facilities. In this respect, we believe that Nautilus can foster collaboration among different training teams and programs, and stimulate less skilled trainers, which alone would have perhaps prepared only basic scenarios, to access and reuse more advanced exercises prepared by others. Finally, we preliminary show the effectiveness and ease of use of the Nautilus Cyber Range via the results of a (so far) small-scale usability test conducted among different prospective trainers.},

abstract = {Knowledge exists at both the organizational and unit levels; environment factors at either level may enable or impede knowledge sharing within an IT organization. There is, however, no meaningful means to measure organizational or unit level knowledge sharing. The need to understand this flow of knowledge within an organization is dramatically evidenced in information technology organizations in which insufficient knowledge sharing leads to intellectual capital loss, rework, skills deterioration, and repeated mistakes that increase project costs leading to failure. The goal of the current study was to examine the relationship among knowledge sharing processes at the organizational level--organizational learning factors--the unit level--project learning practices--and the success of the IT project. Twelve organizational learning factors, eleven project learning practices, and nine project success variables were identified and validated through an expert panel review. These constructs were then codified in a survey and distributed to 5,000 IT managers. This study found a positive and significant relationship among organizational learning, project learning, and project success in IT organizations.},

abstract = {The amount of diverse tags used to classify posts on Stack Overflow increased in the last years to more than 38,000 tags. Many of these tags have the same or similar meaning. Stack Overflow provides an approach to reduce the amount of tags by allowing privileged users to manually create synonyms. However, currently exist only 2,765 synonym-pairs on Stack Overflow that is quite low compared to the total number of tags. To comprehend how synonym-pairs are built, we manually analyzed the tags and how the synonyms could be created automatically. Based on our findings, we then present TSST, a tag synonym suggestion tool, that outputs a ranked list of possible synonyms for each input tag. We first evaluated TSST with the 2,765 approved synonym-pairs of Stack Overflow. For 88.4\% of the tags TSST finds the correct synonyms, for 72.2\% the correct synonym is within the top 10 suggestions. In addition, we applied TSST to 10 ran-domly selected Android related tags and evaluated the suggested synonyms with 20 Android app developers in an online survey. Overall, in 80\% of their ratings, developers found an adequate synonym suggested by TSST.},

While previous work evaluated this task by manually annotating the relationship between q and , this approach does not scale for large-scale CQA sites. We therefore explore an automatic evaluation method for reused answer retrieval, which computes nDCG by defining the gain value of each retrieved answer as a ROUGE score that treats the original answers to q as gold summaries. Our answer retrieval experiment suggests that effective reused answer retrieval systems may not be the same as effective gold answer retrieval systems. We provide case studies to discuss the benefits and limitations of our approach.},
