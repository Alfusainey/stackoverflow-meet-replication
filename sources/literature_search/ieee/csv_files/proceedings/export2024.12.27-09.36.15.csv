The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatG PT presents a new learning paradigm. While existing research explores the potential of LLMs in software development and education, their impact on developers' learning and solution-seeking behavior remains unexplored. To address this gap, we conducted a survey targeting software developers and computer science students, gathering 341 responses, of which 268 were completed and analyzed. This study investigates how AI chatbots like ChatGPT have influenced developers' learning preferences when acquiring new skills, ex-ploring technologies, and resolving programming issues. Through quantitative and qualitative analysis, we explore whether AI tools supplement or replace traditional learning resources such as video tutorials, written tutorials, and Q&A forums. Our findings reveal a nuanced view: while video tutorials continue to be highly preferred for their comprehensive coverage, a significant number of respondents view AI chatbots as potential replacements for written tutorials, underscoring a shift towards more interactive and personalized learning experiences. Additionally, AI chatbots are increasingly considered valuable supplements to video tutorials, indicating their growing role in the developers' learning resources. These insights offer valuable directions for educators and the software development community by shedding light on the evolving preferences toward learning resources in the era of ChatGPT.","2576-3148","979-8-3503-9568-6","10.1109/ICSME58944.2024.00045","National Science Foundation(grant numbers:CCF-1846142); Saudi Arabian Cultural Mission (SACM); King Abdulaziz University (KAU); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10795042","AI-driven learning tools;ChatGPT;programming learning preferences;programming issue resolution;video tutorials;written tutorials;Q&A forums;developer learning resources","Surveys;Software maintenance;Large language models;Education;Tutorials;Chatbots;Market research;Programming profession;Software development management","","","","46","IEEE","19 Dec 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Recent years have witnessed the transition from the traditional service registries to its successor, the Service Marketplaces, which involves deeper engagement in the SOA software lifecycle and offers additional features, such as service request delegation and monitoring of services' Quality of Service (QoS). However, by analyzing developers' questions posted on online Q&A forums, we found that many developers struggle with such transition, leading to development inefficiencies and even security vulnera-bilities. This paper presents the first empirical study aimed at uncovering the issues developers face with marketplaces, particularly those arising from the transition. Through a meticulous process of manually labeling and analyzing developers' questions, we develop a taxonomy of these issues, summarize the impacts caused by the transition, and provide actionable suggestions to App developers, service providers, and marketplaces. Utilizing the labeled questions and our insights, we fine-tune a Large Language Model (LLM) for providing answers to similar questions raised by developers and helping service providers and marketplaces extract useful information from these questions, such as service outages and key leakages. Our evaluation of the model's performance in answering and extracting pertinent information from a set of real-world questions demonstrates its effectiveness: it accurately classified 85 % of the queries and successfully identified 88 % of service names and 77 % of key leakages. As the first empirical study in this domain, this work not only aids developers in navigating the transition more effectively but also sheds light on the under explored issue of service registry evolution, offering valuable insights for researchers.","","979-8-3503-6851-2","10.1109/SSE62657.2024.00037","NSF(grant numbers:2104337,2152819); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10664239","Service Marketplace;Q&A forums;Taxonomy;Large Language Model","Navigation;Large language models;Taxonomy;Quality of service;Software;Service-oriented architecture;Data mining","","","","20","IEEE","18 Sep 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Many software information sites rely on tags to classify their contents, i.e. software objects, in order to improve the performance and accuracy of various operations on the sites. The quality of tags thus has a significant impact on the usefulness of these sites. High quality tags are expected to be concise and can describe the most important features of the software objects. Unfortunately tagging is inherently an uncoordinated process. The choice of tags made by individual software developers is dependent not only on a developer's understanding of the software object but also on the developer's English skills and preferences. As a result, the number of different tags grows rapidly along with continuous addition of software objects. With thousands of different tags, many of which introduce noise, software objects become poorly classified. Such phenomenon affects negatively the speed and accuracy of developers' queries. In this paper, we propose a tool called TagMulRec to automatically recommend tags and classify software objects in evolving large-scale software information sites. Given a new software object, TagMulRec locates the software objects that are semantically similar to the new one and exploit their tags. We have evaluated TagMulRec on four software information sites, StackOverflow, AskUbuntu, AskDifferent and Freecode. According to our empirical study, TagMulRec is not only accurate but also scalable that can handle a large-scale software information site with millions of software objects and thousands of tags.","","978-1-5090-5501-2","10.1109/SANER.2017.7884628","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7884628","Software Information Site;Tag Recommendation;Software Object;Multi-Classification","Software;Tagging;Indexes;Search problems;Social network services;Software algorithms;Semantics","","40","","41","IEEE","23 Mar 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As a result of such difficulties, programmers frequently ask about them in on-line fora. Our goal is to gain some insight into both the misuse of permissions and the discussions of permissions in on-line fora. We analyze about 10,000 free apps from popular Android markets and found a significant sub-linear relationship between the popularity of a permission and the number of times when it is misused. We also study the relationship of permission use and the number of questions about the permission on StackOverflow.

However, the code snippets in such a forum often contain undeclared, ambiguous, or largely unqualified external references. Such declaration ambiguity and external reference ambiguity present challenges for developers in learning to correctly use the APIs. In this paper, we propose StatType, a statistical approach to resolve the fully qualified names (FQNs) for the API elements in such code snippets. Unlike existing approaches that are based on heuristics, StatType has two well-integrated factors. We first learn from a large training code corpus the FQNs that often co-occur. Then, to derive the FQN for an API name in a code snippet, we use that knowledge and leverage the context consisting of neighboring API names. To realize those factors, we treat the problem as statistical machine translation from source code with partially qualified names to source code with FQNs of the APIs. Our empirical evaluation on real-world code and StackOverflow posts shows that StatType achieves very high accuracy with 97.6% precision and 96.7% recall, which is 16.5% relatively higher than the state-of-the-art approach.","1558-1225","978-1-4503-5638-1","10.1145/3180155.3180230","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8453132","Type Resolution;Type Inference;Type Annotations;Partial Program Analysis;Statistical Machine Translation;Naturalness;Big Code","Computational modeling;Software libraries;Training;Software;Tools","","19","","","","2 Sep 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Linking these accounts, which is called identity linkage, is a prerequisite of many interesting studies such as investigating activities of one developer in two or more communities. Many researches have been performed on social networks, but very few of them can be adapted to software communities, as information of users provided in these communities has a huge difference to that in social networks. We tackle with the problem by introducing TBIL, a novel tagging-based approach to identity linkage among software communities. The essential idea of this approach is to employ skills (measured by tags), usernames and concerned topics of developers as hints, and to use a decision tree-based algorithm and another heuristic greedy matching algorithm to link user identities. We measure the effectiveness of TBIL on two well-known software communities, i.e., StackOverflow and Github. The results show that our method is feasible and practical in linking developer identities. In particular, the F-Score of our method is 0.15 higher than previous identity linkage methods in software communities.","1530-1362","978-1-4673-9644-8","10.1109/APSEC.2015.48","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7467283","Identity Linkage;Software Engineering Community","Software;Couplings;Social network services;Feature extraction;Software algorithms;Joining processes;Electronic mail","","9","","29","IEEE","12 May 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Other external sources of information for developers, such as StackOverflow, have benefited from the existence of informative tags, which help developers to quickly gauge the relevance of posts and find related ones. We argue that the same is valid also for videos and propose the first set of approaches to automatically generate tags describing the contents of software development video tutorials. We investigate seven tagging approaches for this purpose, some using information retrieval techniques and leveraging only the information in the videos, others relying on external sources of information, such as StackOverflow, as well as two out-of-the-box commercial video tagging approaches.

First, through the web crawler technology to obtain online comments data from the online communities, forums and socialized Q&A websites and clean the data. Then, the text data is subjected to entity extraction, relationship extraction, and knowledge fusion to construct a domain knowledge graph of the universities. Finally, use the complex network analysis method to determine the comprehensive evaluation system of universities. This evaluation method is not only an important supplement to the existing university evaluation system, but also can provide new ideas for constructing scientific and objective educational evaluation by using new technology.","2247-5443","978-1-7281-5344-5","10.1109/ROEDUNET.2019.8909610","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8909610","online comments;universities;comprehensive evaluation system;knowledge graph;complex network analysis","Education;Performance evaluation;Indexes;Big Data;Data mining;Internet;Business","","1","","34","IEEE","25 Nov 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Examples include social media messages, advertisement, Q&A websites, and an increasing number of other applications. They are characterized by little context words and a large vocabulary. As a consequence, traditional short text representations, such as TF and TF-IDF, have high dimensionality and are very sparse. The research field of word vectors has produced interesting word representations that are discriminative regarding semantics, which can be algebraically composed to create vector representations for paragraphs and documents. Literature reports limitations of this approach, producing the alternative Paragraph Vector method. Firstly, we investigate whether these limitations involving word vector operations are true for short text. Then, we propose a novel representation method based on the PSO meta-heuristic. Results in a document classification task are competitive with TF-IDF and show significant improvement over Paragraph Vector, with the advantage of dense and compact document vector representation.","","978-1-5386-8023-0","10.1109/BRACIS.2018.00053","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8575624","hort Text, Text Representation, Word Vectors, Document Vectors, Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning","Semantics;Task analysis;Vocabulary;Neural networks;Social network services;Encoding;Measurement","","1","","15","IEEE","16 Dec 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the quality of raw labels manually added by users or generated by artificial algorithms cannot be guaranteed. Such low-quality labels decrease the usability and result in bad user experiences. In this paper, by observing that crowdsourcing is a best-fit for computer-hard tasks, we leverage crowdsourcing to improve the quality of POI labelling. To our best knowledge, this is the first work on crowdsourced POI labelling tasks. In particular, there are two sub-problems: (1) how to infer the correct labels for each POI based on workers' answers, and (2) how to effectively assign proper tasks to workers in order to make more accurate inference for next available workers. To address these two problems, we propose a framework consisting of an inference model and an online task assigner. The inference model measures the quality of a worker on a POI by elaborately exploiting (i) worker's inherent quality, (ii) the spatial distance between the worker and the POI, and (iii) the POI influence, which can provide reliable inference results once a worker submits an answer. As workers are dynamically coming, the online task assigner judiciously assigns proper tasks to them so as to benefit the inference. The inference model and task assigner work alternately to continuously improve the overall quality. We conduct extensive experiments on a real crowdsourcing platform, and the results on two real datasets show that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.","","978-1-5090-2020-1","10.1109/ICDE.2016.7498229","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7498229","","Labeling;Crowdsourcing;Computational modeling;Random variables;Computer science;Mobile radio mobility management;Reliability","","76","","27","IEEE","23 Jun 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Despite the importance of its quality, due to the large size of a site to cover, dense crowdsourcing is neither cost-effective nor convenient for crowdsourcing participants, making it critical and challenging to balance between signal quality and crowdsourcing cost. To address this problem, we propose a novel incentive mechanism, BCCS, based on Bayesian Compressive Crowdsensing (BCS). BCCS iteratively determines the spatial grids for crowd-sourcing quality and predicts the remaining unexplored grids for deployment efficiency. BCS returns not only the predicted signal values, but also the confidence intervals for convergence and incentive control. A probabilistic user participation and measurement model is applied for incentive design, which is flexible for crowdsensing deployment. Our extensive evaluation based on two different data sets shows that BCCS achieves much higher prediction accuracy (often by more than 20%) with lower payments to the participants and fewer iterations (often by 30%) than existing solutions.","","978-1-5386-4128-6","10.1109/INFOCOM.2018.8485972","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8485972","","Crowdsourcing;Sensors;Compressed sensing;Task analysis;Bayes methods;Monitoring;Correlation","","61","","40","IEEE","11 Oct 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we focus on the AI-based damage assessment applications where deep neural network approaches are used to automatically identify damage severity of impacted areas from imagery reports in the aftermath of a disaster (e.g., earthquake, hurricane, landslides). While AI algorithms often significantly reduce the detection time and labor cost in such applications, their performance sometimes falls short of the desired accuracy and is considered to be less reliable than domain experts. To exacerbate the problem, the black-box nature of the AI algorithms also makes it difficult to troubleshoot the system when their performance is unsatisfactory. The emergence of crowdsourcing platforms (e.g., Amazon Mechanic Turk, Waze) brings about the opportunity to incorporate human intelligence into AI algorithms. However, the crowdsourcing platform is also black-box in terms of the uncertain response delay and crowd worker quality. In this work, we propose the CrowdLearn, a crowd-AI hybrid system that leverages the crowdsourcing platform to troubleshoot, tune, and eventually improve the black-box AI algorithms by welding crowd intelligence with machine intelligence. The system is specifically designed for deep learning-based damage assessment (DDA) applications where the crowd tend to be more accurate but less responsive than machines.

Underlying the success of crowdsourcing is a common theme - the microtask. By breaking down the overall task at hand into microtasks providing short, self-contained pieces of work, work can be performed independently, quickly, and in parallel - enabling numerous and often untrained participants to chip in. This paper puts forth a research agenda, examining the question of whether the same kinds of successes that microtask crowdsourcing is having in revolutionizing other domains can be brought to software development.

However, crowdsourcing applications in the fields of design research and creative innovation have been much slower to emerge. So, although there have been reports of systems and researchers using Internet crowdsourcing to carry out generative design, there are still many gaps in knowledge about the capability and limitations of the technology. For example on crowdsourcing platforms, like Amazon's Mechanical Turk, the relationship between remuneration and the final quality of designs has not been established, so it is unclear how much payment should be offered to ensure a particular standard of result. To investigate the relationship between the crowd's remuneration and the quality of their innovation, this paper reports how payment for a 2D interior design task (living room layout) was systematically varied and the quality of the output assessed by a ranking process that was also crowdsourced. Information about individual Mturk workers who participated in the study was also collected. The results suggest that while average design quality only slowly increases, the quality of the “best” design generated by the crowd improved dramatically with payment levels. In other words, increasing monetary rewards does not improve the average creativity of design but rather it increases the chance of an excellent solution being generated by an individual in the crowd.","","978-1-4799-3776-9","10.1109/CSCWD.2014.6846895","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6846895","crowdsourcing;open innovation;Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk);interior design;design productivity;crowdsourcing demographics","Layout;Google;Crowdsourcing;Correlation;Technological innovation;Educational institutions;Collaboration","","14","","32","IEEE","8 Jul 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The other part is that the server determines the payments of selected users to avoid the bidder's cheating behavior through a pricing algorithm that if and only if users honestly bid their cost, they can obtain the maximum utility.

Nowadays, crowdsourcing services have simplified the process, reducing the cost, facilitating more evaluations per stimuli. The key challenge in using crowdsourcing for perceptual evaluation is the quality which significantly varies across workers. Is it better to have multiple annotations with lower inter-evaluator agreement or to have few annotations with higher inter-evaluator agreement? This study explores this tradeoff between quality and quantity in emotional annotations to characterize expressive behaviors. The analysis relies on emotional labels from the MSP-IMPROV database, where each video was evaluated by over 20 workers.

We formulate the price competition as a dynamic non-cooperative game, where each crowdsourcer independently decides its own price aiming at highest profit and all smartphone users join the crowdsourcers at their satisfaction.

Errors from clock synchronization, GPS location determination, or sensor heterogeneity result in biased and correlated errors in the sampled data from each individual sensor. Furthermore, in CPS sensors are often mobile and operate asynchronously. This affects the spatial sampling rates among sensors and results in nonuniform sample spacing. We refer to these sampling issues as the noisy multi-source, variable-rate (MSVR) sampling problem. This work introduces and investigates signal reconstruction algorithms given MSVR sampling conditions.

This has the potential to reduce interpretation/reading time and possibly improve accuracy by building a consensus on the findings beforehand and letting the medical experts make the final diagnosis. In this paper, we focus on a virtual colonoscopy (VC) application with the clinical technicians as our target users, and the radiologists acting as consultants and classifying segments as benign or malignant. In particular, C2A is used to analyze and explore crowd responses on video segments, created from fly-throughs in the virtual colon. C2A provides several interactive visualization components to build crowd consensus on video segments, to detect anomalies in the crowd data and in the VC video segments, and finally, to improve the non-expert user's work quality and performance by A/B testing for the optimal crowdsourcing platform and application-specific parameters. Case studies and domain experts feedback demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in improving workers' output quality, the potential to reduce the radiologists' interpretation time, and hence, the potential to improve the traditional clinical workflow by marking the majority of the video segments as benign based on the crowd consensus.","","978-1-5090-5661-3","10.1109/VAST.2016.7883508","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7883508","Crowdsourcing;virtual colonoscopy;visual analytics;biomedical applications","Crowdsourcing;Colon;Visual analytics;Hospitals;Virtual colonoscopy;Medical diagnostic imaging","","7","","39","IEEE","23 Mar 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, producing a reliable crowd labeled training corpus is challenging and resource consuming. Research on crowdsourcing has shown that label quality is much affected by worker engagement and expertise. In this study, we postulate that label quality can also be affected by inherent ambiguity of the documents to be labeled. Such ambiguities are not known in advance, of course, but, once encountered by the workers, they lead to disagreement in the labeling - a disagreement that cannot be resolved by employing more workers. To deal with this problem, we propose a crowd labeling framework: we train a disagreement predictor on a small seed of documents, and then use this predictor to decide which documents of the complete corpus should be labeled and which should be checked for document-inherent ambiguities before assigning (and potentially wasting) worker effort on them. We report on the findings of the experiments we conducted on crowdsourcing a Twitter corpus for sentiment classification.","","978-1-5386-5090-5","10.1109/DSAA.2018.00028","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8631437","worker disagreement, crowdsourcing, dataset quality, label reliability, tweet ambiguity","Crowdsourcing;Task analysis;Reliability;Silicon;Labeling;Training;Prediction algorithms","","6","","31","IEEE","3 Feb 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Machine learning and deep learning algorithms are used to predict upcoming flooding situations and rainfall occurrences by using predicted weather information and historical data set of flood and rainfall. Crowdsourcing is used as a novel method for identifying flood threatening areas. Weather information is gathered from citizens and it will help to build a procedure to notify the public and authorities of imminent flood risks. The IoT device tracks the real-time meteorological conditions and monitors continuously. The overall outcome showcases that machine learning models, deep learning algorithms, IoT and crowdsourcing information are equally contributing to predict and forecast risky weather conditions.

In order to utilize pedestrians' traces for indoor location inference, existing proposals mostly rely on infrastructural references or accurate data sources, which are by nature restricted in terms of applicability and pervasiveness. Our proposal called SenseWit is motivated by the observation that people's behavior offers meaningful clues for location inference. The noise, ambiguity, and behavior diversity contained in the crowdsourced data, however, mean non-trivial challenges in generating high-quality floorplans. We propose 1) a novel concept called Nail to identify featured locations in indoor space and 2) a heuristic pathlet bundling algorithm to progressively discover the internal layouts. We implement SenseWit and conduct real-world experiments in different spaces. Our work offers an efficient technique to obtain high-quality structures (either logical or physical) from low-quality data.

Two groups, 1. experts and 2. non-experts, completed a calorie estimation survey consisting of 15 meal images. Descriptive statistics were used to analyse the performance of each group. Collectively, non-experts could determine which meals had larger amounts of calories and analysis showed that meals with greater calories resulted in greater standard deviations of non-expert estimates. Secondary experiments were completed that used crowdsourcing to adjust user calorie estimations using non-expert calorie estimations. Five-fold cross validation was used and results from the calorie adjustment process show a reduced overall mean calorie difference in each fold and the mean error percentage decreased from 40.85% to 25.52% in comparing original mean estimations against adjusted mean estimations. As such, there is credibility in adjusting calorie estimates from a crowd as opposed to simply taking a central measure such as the mean.","","978-1-5090-3050-7","10.1109/BIBM.2017.8217803","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8217803","","Estimation;Crowdsourcing;Standards;Mathematical model;Testing;Obesity;Correlation","","3","","12","IEEE","18 Dec 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we study the specific optimization problem of obtaining results the fastest for a crowdsourced job with a fixed total budget. In crowdsourcing, jobs are usually broken down into sets of small tasks, which are assigned to workers one at a time. We consider three scenarios of increasing complexity: Identical Round Homogeneous Tasks, Multiplex Round Homogeneous Tasks, and Multiple Round Heterogeneous Tasks.

However, the straightforward use of sound measurements from smartphones leads to large measurement errors. As a result, it is essential to calibrate a smartphone before it can be used for noise level measurements. Little work has been done on automatic smartphone calibration for noise measurement purposes. In this paper we design a system called iCal for calibrating smartphones for accurate noise level measurements. The system consists of two key components: node-based calibration and crowdsourcing-based calibration. The node-based calibration enables an individual smartphone to do offline calibration, but suffers a slow-start issue. Complementing the node-based calibration, the crowdsourcing-based calibration leverages the power of crowdsourcing to maintain a lookup table, which a smartphone user can consult to find an approximate offset specific to its smartphone model. Thus, the slow-start issue can be effectively mitigated. The salient feature of iCal is human intervention free.

As a spatial crowdsourcing system can deploy any interested workers, the system is prone to unreliable and untrustworthy workers. Therefore, finding and allocating tasks to trustworthy workers is paramount to ensure the quality and sustainability of the system. Trust and reputation are key factors for evaluating workers’ trustworthiness. Unfortunately, current approaches to the evaluation of workers’ trustworthiness mostly rely on a single trust or reputation factor, and the trustworthiness is mainly based on a binary decision. To address these limitations, we propose a spatial task allocation framework that allocates every task in accordance with a workers’ degree of perceived trustworthiness, which is computed based on multi-criteria trust and reputation factors and a fuzzy method. Our approach evaluates workers’ reputations based on the ratings of workers’ past completed tasks, and workers’ trust is evaluated based on the sentiment analysis of their past tasks’ reviews. The attained reputation and trust values are then combined using a fuzzy inference system to obtain the degree of trustworthiness of each worker for every spatial task. Our experimental findings show that the proposed framework is able to find and allocate every spatial task to the most trustworthy workers from a pool of available workers. When evaluated against other baseline approaches, our proposed approach demonstrates the highest accuracy in terms of allocating every task to workers in accordance with their degree of perceived trustworthiness.","","978-1-6654-1471-5","10.1109/FITI52050.2020.9424909","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9424909","Trust and reputation factors;trustworthiness evaluation;spatial crowdsourcing;fuzzy logic;task allocation","Crowdsourcing;Fuzzy logic;Technological innovation;Sentiment analysis;Resource management;Task analysis;Sustainable development","","3","","31","IEEE","11 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Following the subject bias theory, we simulate the ratings of different user groups with different bias and various magnitudes of uncertainty, while also considering the presence of unreliable raters. We apply traditional reliability metrics on the ratings and compare their sensitivity in identifying the severity of the raters’ biases and uncertainties. Our results show that the average Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient between raters can serve as a strong indicator for issues with the crowdsourcing study.

Deriving the true answer of tasks in crowdsourcing systems based on user-provided data is susceptible to data poisoning attacks, whereby malicious users may intentionally or strategically report incorrect information to mislead the system into inferring the wrong truth for a set of tasks. Recent work has proposed several attacks on the crowdsourcing systems and showed that existing truth inference methods may be vulnerable to such attacks. In this paper, we propose solutions to enhance the robustness of existing truth inference methods. Our solutions base on 1) detecting and augmenting the answers for the boundary tasks in which users could not reach a strong consensus and hence are subjective to potential manipulation, and 2) enhancing inference method with a stronger prior. We empirically evaluate these defense mechanisms by designing attack scenarios that aim to decrease the accuracy of the system. Experiments show that our method is effective and significantly improves the robustness of the system under attack.","","978-1-7281-8777-8","10.1109/SMDS49396.2020.00013","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9288508","Robustness;Data poisoning attack;Truth Inference;Crowdsourcing","Crowdsourcing;Conferences;Robustness;Task analysis","","3","","45","IEEE","24 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Though, the crowds, compared with machines, provided relatively more accurate results, both platforms were slow in execution and hence expensive to implement. In this paper, a hybrid human-machine system was proposed where machines were firstly used on the data set before the humans were further used to identify potential duplicates.

Task design is one of the core aspects of the crowdsourcing process and its optimization is a priority for many requesters that want to have their tasks solved in short times and with high levels of accuracy. Aligned with this goal, a cognitive personalization framework can make it feasible to assess the information processing preferences of crowd workers in order to provide a useful user interface (UI) adaptation. In an effort to address this issue, this study recruited a total of 64 crowd workers to take cognitive style tests and perform prototypical tasks. The results indicate that it is possible to apply short tests and then obtain some useful indicators for better matching tasks to workers with implications for improving the general outcomes and acceptance rates in crowdsourcing.","","978-1-6654-0527-0","10.1109/CSCWD54268.2022.9776164","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9776164","crowdsourcing;microtasks;cognition;human intelligence tasks;personalization;task design;user interface","Crowdsourcing;Conferences;Information processing;User interfaces;Task analysis;Optimization","","2","","49","IEEE","20 May 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It is a security problem that could be used in cyberattacks to gain entry to digitally stored data unless the defect is fixed with a software patch. We found that a growing community of developers can shift the production from inside the company to its ecosystem partners (eg. bug bounty hunters) using a comprehensive framework for code exposure. That is, instead of closed vertical integration, enterprises can opt to innovate utilizing open external contracts. It's preferable if the center of value creation shifts from within the company to outside. Digital commodities, unlike physical items, allow businesses to maximize spillovers. Bug Bounty Programs use crowdsourcing to find bugs. Bug Bounty Programs (BBPs) are becoming standard security practices within enterprises, thanks to the benefits of crowdsourcing flaw and vulnerability management. Bug bounty programs help businesses by enlisting the help of hackers who can find flaws in their software. Because these programs have access to a larger number of hackers or testers, the chances of detecting problems before malicious hackers try to exploit them are higher. It can be a good public relations option for businesses. These programs can also act as a signal to the public and regulators that a company's security program is well-developed. The relevance of these types of programs is expected to grow, as they have become an industry standard that should attract investment from all companies. We evaluate the existing competitors in the market and learn from the case studies accessible while designing our own bug bounty platform. We also look at the Vulnerability Market Mechanism as well as five key aspects of BBP practice: Scoping of BBPs, Timing of Crowd Engagement, Quality of Submission, Researcher-Firm Communication, and Hackers Motivation Management. We examine difficulties in each area and aim to put strategies in place to improve the effectiveness of BBP. This study contributes to research and practice by identifying difficulties and best practices in crowdsourcing information security for rapid vulnerability detection and mitigation.","","978-1-6654-9263-8","10.1109/ICAST55766.2022.10039642","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10039642","vulnerability;researcher;crowdsourcing;Bug Bounty Programs;BBPs;hackers;testers","Crowdsourcing;Codes;Computer hacking;Computer bugs;Companies;Software;Timing","","2","","21","IEEE","13 Feb 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In general, these labelers may make mistakes. Typical learning methods rely on an often overlooked assumption that a single expert can provide the required supervision; however, it is becoming more common for supervision to be available in many forms as data can be shared and processed by increasingly larger audiences. This makes it possible for not just one but many labelers to offer some forms of supervision (this phenomena is coined as crowdsourcing). Some annotators may be more reliable than others, malicious, or may be correlated with others. Annotator effectiveness may vary depending on the data instance presented. We utilize a probabilistic model for learning a classifier from multiple annotators, where the reliability of the annotators may vary with the annotator and the data that they observe. Although we may have access to many annotators, it is still expensive to label and not all annotators have the same level of expertise. The general problem of intelligently choosing instances for labeling is known as active learning. The crowdsourcing paradigm posits new challenges to active learning - not only are we interested in which sample to label next but also which annotator should be queried to benefit our learning model the most. This paper presents different approaches for performing active learning in the crowdsourcing setting.","","978-1-4799-8009-3","10.1109/ALLERTON.2014.7028481","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7028481","Crowd Sourcing;Multiple Annotation;Active Learning;Graphical Models;Classification;Adversarial Annotators","Mathematical model;Data models;Equations;Uncertainty;Labeling;Training;Reliability","","2","","25","IEEE","2 Feb 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, that work has not yet taken the crowd worker's reliability into consideration. Crowd workers usually come with various social and economic backgrounds, and have different levels of reliability. To further improve the overall quality of crowdsourcing with IVLs, this work presents practical methods that quantitatively estimate worker's reliability in terms of his/her correctness, confidence, stability, and predictability from his/her IVLs. With worker's reliability, this paper proposes two learning schemes: weighted interval majority voting (WIMV) and weighted preferred matching probability (WPMP).

In particular, many cloud-based projects have benefited from crowdsourcing their needs for resources and they rely on the crowd and the resources they provide, either for free or for a nominal fee. However, current cloud platforms either provide services to the crowd or request services from them. Moreover, cloud services generally include a legally binding contract between the cloud service providers and cloud service clients. In this paper, the possible opportunities for applying crowdsourcing principles in the cloud in a new fashion are reviewed by proposing the idea of crowdcloud. Crowdcloud simply refers to the availability of cloud infrastructure, cloud platform, and cloud software services to the crowd by the crowd with or without a legally binding contract. This paper discusses the differences between crowdcloud and other similar notions already in existence. Then, a functional architecture is proposed for crowdcloud and its constituents.

Crowdsourcing aims to provide incentives to users to deploy a large number of cheap but potentially noisy sensors. The sensors all send their data to a fusion center, where typically some algorithms are used to remove the noise from the data. Such crowdsourced monitoring of spectrum has been shown to be feasible in practice in multiple studies. One of the key goals of such monitoring is to identify any users that are violating the protocols of accessing spectrum. While a number of crowdsourcing techniques to identify such violations have been proposed, a key challenge that remains is to minimize the cost of data consumption and energy of running the sensors. In this work, we propose sequential probing of sensors to accurately localize/identify such transmitters. We formulate this as a Gaussian Process multi-armed bandit problem, and use a widely known solution technique called Upper Confidence Bound to solve it. We next observe that such sequential probing incurs additional latency, and use batched selection of sensors in few rounds to reduce latency. We show that instead of naively selecting sensors in parallel batches, an intelligent technique of selecting sensors called Gaussian Process Adaptive Upper Confidence Bound (GP-AUCB) can lead to selection of sensors that can lead to more accurate localization. Finally, we show the tradeoff between accuracy of localization, latency incurred and number of selected sensors via simulations.","2334-3125","978-1-6654-1339-8","10.1109/DySPAN53946.2021.9677290","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9677290","","Location awareness;Crowdsourcing;Protocols;Transmitters;Dynamic spectrum access;Gaussian processes;Sensor fusion","","1","","26","IEEE","20 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In metropolitan areas, as an increasing number of applications need to work with multi-source sensing to enhance the data diversity, developing an economic model for such a crowdsourcing system is required to support the multiple concurrent tasks while satisfying certain constraints. In this paper, we address the issue of sensing service pricing where several mobile contributors compete with each other to provide secondary sensing services to the crowdsourcers to fulfill the multi-task sensing demand. The objective of the mobile contributors is to maximize its utility using an equilibrium pricing strategy under the quality of service (QoS) constraints. This secondary sensing approach augments the capabilities of existing mobile contributors without introducing additional costs, resulting in a win-win strategy for both mobile contributors and crowdsourcing systems. We formulate this as an oligopoly market and apply a non-cooperative dynamic game, which is based on the Bertrand model to analyze the impact of several parameters at the Nash equilibrium. For this dynamic game, distributed dynamic learning algorithm is proposed. The stability of the proposed distributed algorithm is studied in terms of the convergence to the Nash equilibrium.

In ensuring the credibility and reliability of Malaysian platforms and also local crowdsourcing industry, a platform certification needs to be established. The certification will also ensure local platforms meet certain technical requirements that are needed. The certified platforms will create confidence to job providers and crowd workers involve in crowd sourcing industry in Malaysia. Thus, the objective of this paper is to propose a framework of management system that caters the process of the certification. Focus groups meetings and workshops were held to gather information from stakeholders regarding the crowd sourcing practices, process and the components of the ecosystem. Follow up interviews were done with existing Malaysian platforms. The interviews help to uncover current practices and requirements in existing Malaysian crowdsourcing platforms. The findings facilitate the construction of generic framework of e-management to certify the platform. Other components like platform architecture and payment system need further study.

With its growing popularity, people are continuously introducing new crowdsourcing-based applications and searching for suitable crowd platforms for the deployment of those applications as a service. Consequently, a contributor participates in multiple platforms from different SPs and concurrently executes various tasks in a time interval. As the number of SP increases, managing and monitoring each contributor separately becomes a primary challenge for each SP. Moreover, upgrading a service, ensuring service scalability, and migration is tough for any crowd-based service provider. Frequently, a service provider has difficulty finding the appropriate contributors that will satisfy their service specifications. Besides, as a contributor, it is also hard to decide whether or not they should participate in a task offered by an SP. Therefore, in this paper, we introduced CrowdPick, a middleware that provides a crowdsourced platform for the people who want to provide a crowdsourcing-based service. Each SP contacts CrowdPick for initiating any service chooses an appropriate application package from its repository and specifies its service requirements. Instead of joining individually to each SP, the contributor needs to register into CrowdPick. All the tasks associated with services are scheduled and monitored by CrowdPick, and the CrowdPick decides the corresponding monetary incentives. Along with providing a detailed cost-benefit analysis of an SP and a contributor, we describe the service level agreement (SLA) policies. We simulate our model to show that implementing CrowdPick in real life is viable, and beneficial for both an SP and a contributor.","","978-1-7281-9656-5","10.1109/UEMCON51285.2020.9298037","National Science Foundation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9298037","Crowd Service;Crowd Middleware;Multiple Crowd","Task analysis;Indium phosphide;III-V semiconductor materials;Avalanche photodiodes;Security;Crowdsourcing;Middleware","","","","24","IEEE","25 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Specifically, our proposed scheme employs keyed hash, prefix encoding, and garbled bloom filter techniques to convert a large query range into a small domain, independent of the range length, thus improving accuracy. For the query response, the Optimal Unary Encoding (OUE) technique is applied to achieve ε-LDP. Security analysis shows that our proposed scheme can achieve the desirable privacy requirement for users' private items and the server's query range. In addition, performance evaluations also confirm the efficiency of our scheme in terms of computational costs and communication overhead.

Crowdsourcing systems are also susceptible to Sybil and distributed denial of service (DDoS) assaults. Additionally, the development of crowdsourcing may need to be improved by the platform's expensive service fees. The newly developed blockchain technology may address several social business issues and be an alternative to current technologies. However, there needs to be more proof of the application of Blockchain in social enterprises. We have built a crowdfunding platform using Blockchain that will revolutionize how socially responsible projects are funded and supported.

We propose a framework bringing in human intelligence during the clustering process. The key point of the framework is to choose best questions to perform on the crowdsourcing platform, gather pairwise constraints, and melt the existing algorithm and human input together. As the computation is extensive, we also provide some heuristic optimal methods, including natural transitive relations, to reduce the number of HITs of asking people. We evaluate the framework on real image dataset. The experiment result demonstrates the algorithm achieves a fairly good performance comparing to the other state-of-theart methods, and the optimized strategies significantly reduce the number of HIT.","","978-1-4673-9323-2","10.1109/ISKE.2015.39","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7383074","Image Clustering;Crowdsourcing;Pairwise Constraints;Transitivity","Clustering algorithms;Crowdsourcing;Data mining;Data models;Training;Clustering methods","","","","14","IEEE","14 Jan 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

One of the specific (and most demanded) applications of crowdsourcing is collecting item annotations, i.e., describing the contents of complex items with a help of labels (tags). Input received from crowdsourcing participants is typically unreliable, therefore, to increase the quality of annotations, each item is typically processed by several participants and the obtained annotations have to be aggregated. The paper considers a special case of annotating, where a set of possible labels, as well as the set of relationships between the labeled items and the labels are defined by an OWL 2 ontology (OWL QL). Such semantic item annotations turn out to be very useful in organizing large collections of items and enabling semantic search in them. In order to increase annotations quality, the paper proposes two aggregation methods - Onto Voting and OntoSB, differing in that the first one is agnostic with respect to participants' reliability and the second one accounts for variations in reliability. Simulation experiments with ontology-based annotations of varying quality show that the proposed aggregation methods increase the quality of collected ontology-based item annotations.","","978-952-69244-6-5","10.23919/FRUCT53335.2021.9599979","Russian Foundation for Basic Research(grant numbers:19-07-01120); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9599979","","Crowdsourcing;Technological innovation;Annotations;Semantic search;OWL;Redundancy;Information processing","","","","17","","19 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we propose a group-based task assignment model (GTAM) based on consensus decision strategies, which includes two phases: Worker Preference Modeling (WPM) and Group Preference Modeling(GPM). WPM is based on collaborative filtering to learn each worker's preference for different task categories and GPM utilizes the fuzzy preference matrix based on consensus decision-making to learn the group preferences of the workers.

While designing crowdsourcing tasks, selecting the best form of input and task granularity is essential for keeping the volunteers engaged and maximizing the quality of the results. In the context of biocollections information extraction, this study compares three interface actions (transcribe, select, and crop) and tasks of different levels of granularity (single field vs. compound tasks). Using 30 crowdsourcing experiments and two different populations, these interface alternatives are evaluated in terms of speed, quality, perceived difficulty and enjoyability. The results show that Selection and Transcription tasks generate high quality output, but they are perceived as boring. Conversely, Cropping tasks, and arguably graphical tasks in general, are more enjoyable, but their output quality depend on additional machine-oriented processing. When the text to be extracted is longer than two or three words, Transcription is slower than Selection and Cropping. When using compound tasks, the overall time required for the crowdsourcing experiment is considerably shorter than using single field tasks, but they are perceived as more difficult. When using single field tasks, both the quality of the output and the amount of identified data are slightly higher compared to compound tasks, but they are perceived by the crowd as less entertaining.","","978-1-5386-2565-1","10.1109/CIC.2017.00056","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8181517","crowdsourcing;crowdsourcing interface;task complexity;crowd sentiment","Crowdsourcing;Data mining;Information retrieval;Optical character recognition software;Compounds;Complexity theory","","","","32","IEEE","14 Dec 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To aid software developers in accessing and using this natural language information, soft-ware engineering researchers often use techniques from natural language processing. In this paper, we explore whether frame semantics, a general linguistic approach, which has been used on requirements text, can also help address problems that occur when applying lexicon analysis based techniques to text associated with program comprehension activities. We assess the applicability of generic semantic frame parsing for this purpose, and based on the results, we propose SEFrame to tailor semantic frame parsing for program comprehension uses. We evaluate the correctness and robustness of the approach finding that SEFrame is correct in between 73% and 74% of the cases and that it can parse text from a variety of software artifacts used to support program comprehension.

We first motivate our technique using an exploratory study with 11 core Java packages and 344K Java posts from Stack Overflow. Experiments using 150 code search queries randomly chosen from three Java tutorial sites show that our technique recommends correct API classes within the top 10 results for about 79% of the queries which is highly promising.

A greater number of badges associated with a user profile in some way indicates a higher level of authority, leading to a natural incentive for users to attempt to achieve as many badges as possible. In this study, we examine the publicly available logs for Stack Overflow to examine three of these badges in detail. We look at the effect of one badge in context on an individual user level and at the global scope of three related badges across all users by mining user behaviour around the time that the badge is awarded.

To make an effective use of NLP techniques, consistent vocabulary is essential. Unfortunately, the same concepts are often intentionally or accidentally mentioned in many different morphological forms in informal discussions, such as abbreviations, synonyms and misspellings. Existing techniques to deal with such morphological forms are either designed for general English or predominantly rely on domain-specific lexical rules. A thesaurus of software-specific terms and commonly-used morphological forms is desirable for normalizing software engineering text, but very difficult to build manually. In this work, we propose an automatic approach to build such a thesaurus. Our approach identifies software-specific terms by contrasting software-specific and general corpuses, and infers morphological forms of software-specific terms by combining distributed word semantics, domain-specific lexical rules and transformations, and graph analysis of morphological relations. We evaluate the coverage and accuracy of the resulting thesaurus against community-curated lists of software-specific terms, abbreviations and synonyms. We also manually examine the correctness of the identified abbreviations and synonyms in our thesaurus.

Extracting API mentions in natural language texts is a prerequisite for effective indexing and searching for API-related information in software engineering social content. However, the informal nature of social discussions creates two fundamental challenges for API extraction: common-word polysemy and sentence-format variations. Common-word polysemy refers to the ambiguity between the API sense of a common word and the normal sense of the word (e.g., append, apply and merge). Sentence-format variations refer to the lack of consistent sentence writing format for inferring API mentions. Existing API extraction techniques fall short to address these two challenges, because they assume distinct API naming conventions (e.g., camel case, underscore) or structured sentence format (e.g., code-like phrase, API annotation, or full API name). In this paper, we propose a semi-supervised machine-learning approach that exploits name synonyms and rich semantic context of API mentions to extract API mentions in informal social text. The key innovation of our approach is to exploit two complementary unsupervised language models learned from the abundant unlabeled text to model sentence-format variations and to train a robust model with a small set of labeled data and an iterative self-training process. The evaluation of 1,205 API mentions of the three libraries (Pandas, Numpy, and Matplotlib) in Stack Overflow texts shows that our approach significantly outperforms existing API extraction techniques based on language-convention and sentence-format heuristics and our earlier machine-learning based method for named-entity recognition.","","978-1-5090-3806-0","10.1109/ICSME.2016.11","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7816484","","Natural languages;Feature extraction;Libraries;Context;Standards;Software engineering;Joining processes","","39","","39","IEEE","16 Jan 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In particular, reusing code snippets containing such ambiguous undeclared external references requires significant manual efforts and expertise to resolve them. Manually resolving fully qualified names (FQN) of API elements is a non-trivial task. In this paper, we propose a novel context-sensitive technique, called COSTER, to resolve FQNs of API elements in such code snippets. The proposed technique collects locally specific source code elements as well as globally related tokens as the context of FQNs, calculates likelihood scores, and builds an occurrence likelihood dictionary (OLD). Given an API element as a query, COSTER captures the context of the query API element, matches that with the FQNs of API elements stored in the OLD, and rank those matched FQNs leveraging three different scores: likelihood, context similarity, and name similarity scores. Evaluation with more than 600K code examples collected from GitHub and two different Stack Overflow datasets shows that our proposed technique improves precision by 4-6% and recall by 3-22% compared to state-of-the-art techniques. The proposed technique significantly reduces the training time compared to the StatType, a state-of-the-art technique, without sacrificing accuracy.

In this context, the design of any API strongly influences how developers write code utilizing it. A wrong design decision like a poorly chosen method name can lead to a steeper learning curve, due to misunderstandings, misuse and eventually bug-prone code in the client projects using the API. It is not unfrequent to find APIs with poorly expressive or misleading names, possibly lacking appropriate documentation. Such issues can manifest in what have been defined in the literature as Linguistic Antipatterns (LAs), i.e., inconsistencies among the naming, documentation, and implementation of a code entity. While previous studies showed the relevance of LAs for software developers, their impact on (developers of) client projects using APIs affected by LAs has not been investigated.

By analyzing the characteristics of the accepted answers, we find that there are fewer experts in the microservice than other domains, and such a phenomenon is most significant with respect to the microservice design phase. Furthermore, we perform manual analysis on 6,013 answers accepted by developers and distill 47 general solution strategies for different microservice-related problems, 22 of which are proposed for the first time.

But is that always the case? To understand if programmers have difficulty learning additional programming languages, we conducted an empirical study of Stack Overflow questions across 18 different programming languages. We hypothesized that previous knowledge could potentially interfere with learning a new programming language. From our inspection of 450 Stack Overflow questions, we found 276 instances of interference that occurred due to faulty assumptions originating from knowledge about a different language. To understand why these difficulties occurred, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 16 professional programmers. The interviews revealed that programmers make failed attempts to relate a new programming language with what they already know. Our findings inform design implications for technical authors, toolsmiths, and language designers, such as designing documentation and automated tools that reduce interference, anticipating uncommon language transitions during language design, and welcoming programmers not just into a language, but its entire ecosystem.","1558-1225","978-1-4503-7121-6","","National Science Foundation(grant numbers:1559593,1755762,1814798); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9284077","interference theory;learning;program comprehension;programming environments;programming languages","Computer languages;Ecosystems;Interference;Documentation;Tools;Syntactics;Interviews","","4","","72","","21 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
