The traditional way to consume multimedia together (e.g., with family or friends in the living room) is being superseded by a location-independent scenario where geographically distributed users consume the same content while having a real-time communication channel among each other. Inter-Destination Multimedia Synchronization (IDMS) is the tool of choice in order to enable users a high-quality multimedia experience. In this paper, we investigate the influence of asynchronism when consuming multimedia content together while being geographically distributed. In particular, we adopt the concept of human computation and developed a reaction game which we used to conduct a crowdsourced subjective quality assessment in order to evaluate a threshold for multimedia synchronization within an IDMS scenario. Our results show a significant decrease in overall Quality of Experience (QOE) at an asynchronism level of 750ms. At the same time, we were able to show that asynchronism at a level of 400ms does not have significant differences regarding the QoE when compared to the synchronous reference case.","","978-1-4799-8958-4","10.1109/QoMEX.2015.7148107","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7148107","","Games;Multimedia communication;Video sequences;Training;Synchronization;TV;Streaming media","","7","","19","IEEE","6 Jul 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper aims at targeting the tweets shared on twitter on the basis of emotion behind them-whether it falls under the category of hate speech or not. This paper identifies hate speech by employing various machine learning algorithms. The paper also derives the context in which various words are used and based on it identifies hate speech. It tries to keep the idea of freedom of speech intact and at the same time curtail hate speech which various other algorithms have failed to do. This paper focuses on applying the hate speech check on anti-national tweets.

Users’ comments about a product, when positive, bring exceptional opportunity for sellers because it will act as word of mouth (WOM) advertisement and can increase their sales. On the other hand, users trust in WOM because the person who comments is not motivated to benefit from the sales of the products, but sharing experiences about a product with other customers is a motive. Hence WOM helps customers decide better to buy a product, and if it is positive, it can lead to a sale increase. However, the quality of the comments is another essential factor to be considered in e-commerce websites. Because wrong and misleading comments or answers to users’ questions can increase sales at the cost of decreasing user satisfaction. In this study, for the first time, we have proposed a gamification method to increase the effectiveness of WOM by considering the quality of the user comments. To this end, an influence metric was proposed to calculate the products’ ranking in a new fashion. To evaluate the proposed method, we collected data from an e-commerce website and compared it with classic product rankings methods. Experimental results show a significant difference between the product ranking using the proposed method compared with the classic product ranking methods, and overall it decreases product rankings.","","978-1-6654-0426-6","10.1109/ICWR51868.2021.9443122","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9443122","Gamification;Crowdsourcing;Interactive Ranking;E-Commerce;Online Marketing;Influence Metric","Measurement;Crowdsourcing;Mouth","","6","","32","IEEE","2 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

While a vast array of sensors and IoT devices will be deployed to meet the data requirements of a smart approach to public service delivery, any city's largest and most sophisticated sensor network takes the form of its citizens. As the ones who use the city's infrastructure and services 24/7, they are uniquely placed to report any issues. What stops most people from doing so is firstly the lack of a platform with the appropriate channels and secondly, the lack of immediate incentives - most of the time, an issue will be seen as someone else's job to address.To address these issues, the Vizsafe platform has been designed to mobilize the crowd and give them a reason to submit information that is in everyone's interests. Through the power of blockchain, these reports are stored on a decentralized ledger, and, utilizing smart contracts, SPOT tokens are used as incentive to people that upload incident reports, whether that is a potential security threat or faulty infrastructure. It's the slight nudge that makes `someone else's problem' into `my opportunity'. Once cities start rewarding participation meaningfully, people cease to be consumers and service users but rather contribute information for their collective benefit, while reducing costs for businesses and service providers. They become active partners in maintaining the communities in which they live and work.","","978-1-5386-5959-5","10.1109/ISC2.2018.8656658","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8656658","","Safety;Blockchain;Smart contracts;Security;Smart cities;Sensors","","5","","4","IEEE","4 Mar 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, cultural heritage institutions often lack the human resources to handle the amount of material that is in need of description. One of the possible solutions to this problem is applying the gamification approach in the process of description. Many studies have shown that applying game design features outside traditional game environments can increase the motivation and productivity, and that those games can be particularly effective in invoking intrinsic motivations and overall enjoyment. However, there is a need to explore the quality of such game-generated tags in comparison with using controlled vocabularies and traditional approaches. In this paper, we compare game-generated image labels and professional descriptors. First, a subject expert using controlled vocabulary added descriptors for each image. Then, by using a gamified platform for collecting semantic annotations of digitized images, game-generated tags were collected. In the final stage, game-generated labels were evaluated by the subject expert in the context of appropriateness of using them as descriptors within a standardized system. Results have shown that gamegenerated labels can serve as a basis for high quality labels suitable for including a standardized description in order to enhance description and retrieval.","2623-8764","978-953-233-098-4","10.23919/MIPRO.2019.8756841","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8756841","gamification;image labelling;photographs;subject acess","Games;Image retrieval;Cultural differences;Annotations;Labeling;Indexing","","5","","21","","11 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we propose LIGHTOR, a novel implicit crowd-sourcing approach to overcome these limitations. The key insight is to collect users’ natural interactions with a live streaming platform, and then leverage them to detect highlights.

By using the datasets, the average received power maps linked with transmitter and receiver locations are generated.

Crowd sourcing has recently emerged as a lucrative paradigm for leveraging the collective intelligence of crowds. However, it has inherent weakness that a simple reward setting causes an uneven distribution of workers on each task, which reduces the efficiency of solving the tasks. A challenge is that the system designer is not allowed to set the reward to the arbitrary value because so-called ""market wages"" exist and if the reward is set to the value lower than the market wage, such a task fails to attract the sufficient number of workers. To solve this problem, we focus on the division strategy that divides the crowds into different groups and the workers compete with each other among the same group. We have developed a model that crowds write their codes independently and then try to find bugs in the codes written by the others. Next, we examine two division strategy, random grouping and ability grouping by analyzing the equilibrium behavior of each worker and carrying out simulations. The results show that the division strategy affect the efficiency of crowd sourcing bug detection and the random grouping leads to a higher efficiency compared to the ability grouping.","","978-1-4673-6057-9","10.1109/WI-IAT.2012.86","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6511603","Crowdsourcing efficiency;division strategy;software bug detection","","","4","","6","IEEE","2 May 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Instead, geospatial image is partitioned in space and each expert in the pool studies the partition assigned to him/her.

Technology played a major role in almost all industrial revolutions. So, computers and manufacturing systems will be able to collaborate. One of the pillars of the fourth Industrial Revolution is crowdsensing. Several experiments in the fields of society, infrastructure, agriculture, and health have used it. Crowdsensing in the health sector can help gather a substantial source of data on general public health conditions. However, most crowdsensing techniques rely on only one communication protocol. This method can cause problems if a system failure occurs. Besides that, another consideration is that the crowdsensing users consist of several communication protocols. As a result, we present a multi-communication protocol gateway architecture for crowdsensing that addresses the aforementioned issues by combining two communication protocols, such as HTTP and MQTT, into a single gateway. This gateway serves to receive data from sensor nodes before transmitting it to an IoT platform on a cloud server. The test results show that the MQTT protocol has better performance than the HTTP protocol in the delay test. The MQTT protocol delay reaches 0.113 seconds and the HTTP protocol delay is 0.717 seconds. In addition, the gateway is also able to receive data properly even though both protocols are run simultaneously.","","978-1-6654-4346-3","10.1109/IES53407.2021.9593999","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9593999","Crowdsensing;Crowdsourcing;Internet of Things;Multi-Communication Protocol;MQTT;HTTP","Cloud computing;Protocols;Crowdsensing;Quality of service;Logic gates;Throughput;Delays","","3","","23","IEEE","8 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Moreover, sharing and combining knowledge will transient or non-team members further adds to the complexity of the task. These collaboration challenges are seldom discussed or even mentioned in the research literature. In this talk, I will explore how models, theories and technologies from the disciplines of computer supported cooperative work and social computing can improve and encourage collaboration in reverse engineering. I will briefly present several success stories on how social computing technologies have helped improve how small teams, distributed larger teams and the crowd tackle complex intellectual tasks in other areas of science.

Sensor technology, which is the most commonly used data source for indoor positioning, has an advantage that sensors can receive data from smartphone without installing the device separately. However, indoor positioning technology which depends only on sensor data, has the disadvantage of cumulatively accumulating errors. To solve this problem, techniques using landmarks which make a singular point of indoor localization are studied. In this paper, we provide a system that combines crowd sourcing technique and landmarks to receive data from many unspecified users. Our proposed system updates the indoor landmark map by automatically removing the unused landmarks for a long time and adding more landmarks through crowd sourcing. The system calculates the location of the user through the SLAM algorithm using the improved landmark map.","","978-1-7281-0627-4","10.1109/ICGHIT.2019.00010","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8866952","Indoor localization;Sensor;Landmark;SLAM","Simultaneous localization and mapping;Smart phones;Buildings;Servers;Acceleration;Crowdsourcing","","3","","24","IEEE","14 Oct 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To tackle this we propose Neighbor Assisted Medical Emergency System (NAMES), which through the use of Arduino and Internet of Things (IoT), initiates a cost effective emergency response. NAMES is based around having registered volunteers who provide immediate medical care to those in need on the spot or take the responsibility to escalate the situation towards a hospital or a registered pharmacy for equipment when necessary. Furthermore we introduce a simulation model of NAMES in MATLAB based on experiment results to analyze the system performance using the theory of stochastic geometry. Performance evaluation in terms of outage probability reveals the effects of NAMES system on propagation environment.

With this deviation, nonformal sentences cause problems in linguistic computation because most linguistic computations use formal languages that already have standard rules.

However, they do not support crowd sourcing of complex work consisting of interdependent tasks. Those tasks require not only having simple task/worker pairs, but also coordinating multiple workers together for completion of the crowd work. In this paper, we propose a conceptual framework to bring the coordination support into current online crowd sourcing platforms. In our framework, each crowd worker is modeled as a service that can be self-described, dynamically discovered and assembled into the complex crowd work, meanwhile, we define a workflow-based schema to structure and represent the complex crowd work.

Aimed at this issue, we propose a method to build a comprehensive sentiment lexicon for Chinese internet slang. We leverage online sources to acquire a list of slang words first. Then, a method based on SO-PMI (Semantic Orientation from Pointwise Mutual Information) is used to assign the sentiment polarity to each word. By Utilizing online sources, the slang lexicon has comprehensive coverage of internet slang. The sentiment categorization method based on SO-PMI guarantees the sentiment polarity we acquire from microblog flatforms is compatible with the same microblog context the lexicon aimed to analyze.","","978-1-6654-1734-1","10.1109/CONF-SPML54095.2021.00026","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9706820","Chinese social media;Internet slang;sentiment analysis;sentiment lexicon","Crowdsourcing;Vocabulary;Sentiment analysis;Dictionaries;Social networking (online);Blogs;Semantics","","1","","15","IEEE","15 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

More and more users are increasingly relying on social interaction to complete and validate the results of their online activities.

In this paper we propose paradigm that embodies crowds and social network communities as first-class sources for the information management and extraction on the Web. Our approach aims at filling the gap between traditional Web systems (CMS, search engines and others), which operate upon world-wide information, with social systems, capable of interacting with real people, in real time, to capture their opinions, suggestions, and emotions by leveraging crowd sourcing practices and making them viable upon a social network.

More complex and custom user interfaces like digital games and software are virtually impossible for non-programmers to create; even visual programming (e.g., Blockly, GameMaker Studio 2) and data flow languages that try to make computing more approachable still require an understanding of programming and computing concepts.

Amateur or institutional precipitation stations were also utilized. The overall number of 41 stations was processed. Firstly, quality control of all the data was treated which reduced the number of stations to 31. Time series of precipitation totals during various intervals (5, 10, 60 minutes and 6, 24 hours) were used to demonstrate spatiotemporal variability and precipitation intensity. Results confirmed uneven distribution of summer half-year precipitation totals and the role of geographical distance on its spatial homogeneity.

A variety of research methods, models and theories have been introduced and applied to comprehensively investigate and elucidate the impact of the relationship between design and emotion, as well as how emotions can best be used in design. However, the variable-centered research method ignores the complex interactions of these variables at the individual level. This study adopts a human-centered analysis method that considers users’ emotions and desires as creative drivers, and combines emotional design theory to propose design strategies for the visceral, behavioral and reflective levels respectively. Subsequently, the Tuyi design platform serves as a case study to refine the platform in line with the proposed strategy. Usability testing is then conducted to evaluate the enhancement. The findings indicate that the design strategy significantly boosts the platform’s usability, thereby presenting a valuable foundation for future design initiatives.","2473-3547","979-8-3503-1745-9","10.1109/ISCID59865.2023.00026","National Natural Science Foundation of China; National Key Research and Development Program of China; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10494266","emotional design;interaction design;humancentered design","Crowdsourcing;Human computer interaction;Visualization;Web pages;Psychology;Focusing;User experience","","","","19","IEEE","15 Apr 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Existing databases are typically built on and for PC platform. We present EyeQ, the first IQA benchmark1 that provides crowd-sourced subjective opinions on rate-distortion trade-offs of compressed images on both mobile and the PC platforms. Due to the increasing importance of progressive delivery of web applications, we focused our study on the use case of progressive image delivery and the associated distortions. Our results show that human perception of the perceived rate-distortion trade-off for the same image changes between PC and mobile platforms. We took 7 state-of-the-art full reference (FR) image quality assessment algorithms and evaluated their performance on predicting the optimal rate-distortion trade-off threshold for a given reference image. Our experimental results show that (a) no single FR model captures the optimal rate-distortion trade-offs across all human participants, and (b) fusion ML models that combine all 7 FR measures perform better than any individual FR model on both PC and mobile platforms.","","978-1-5386-0560-8","10.1109/ICMEW.2017.8026275","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8026275","","Crowdsourcing;Image resolution;Google;Facebook;Visualization","","","","23","IEEE","7 Sep 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The trend of distributed teams or Global Software Engineering (GSE) has been on the rise for the last decade or so. Improved resource allocation, cost savings and learning of best practices are some of the benefits that cause this increase. When dealing with distributed teams these organizations face several project management challenges such as communication and coordination issues, cultural differences, knowledge management. Lack of knowledge sharing is one of the most critical issue that needs to be addressed. It is difficult to ensure availability of right knowledge at the right time to the right person. The knowledge needs to be shared across the organization but limitations of knowledge sharing tools or dispersed knowledge sharing media makes it more challenging to share knowledge. In addition, lack of tool support for knowledge sharing further aggravates the problem. This paper presents a unified knowledge sharing framework to facilitate knowledge management in global software engineering environment. The framework aims to mitigate the shortcomings of knowledge sharing tools and dispersed availability of knowledge sharing media by providing communication, collaboration, organizational memory and project management aspects on one platform. The proposed framework is based on the existing knowledge sharing frameworks and will be validated using the criteria formulated on the set of activities which are required or beneficial for knowledge sharing.","","978-1-5386-4744-8","10.1109/ICCOINS.2018.8510567","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8510567","knowledge management;global software engineering;knowledge sharing;challenges of project management.","Knowledge management;Knowledge engineering;Software engineering;Tools;Project management;Systematics;Organizations","","5","","23","IEEE","28 Oct 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Answers, Amazon Mechanical Turk, and etc.) emerged in recent years that allow requesters from all around the world to post tasks and seek help from an equally global pool of workers. However, intrinsic incentive problems reside in crowdsourcing applications as workers and requester are selfish and aim to strategically maximize their own benefit. In this paper, we propose to provide incentives for workers to exert effort using a novel game-theoretic model based on repeated games. As there is always a gap in the social welfare between the non-cooperative equilibria emerging when workers pursue their self-interests and the desirable Pareto efficient outcome, we propose a novel class of incentive protocols based on social norms which integrates reputation mechanisms into the existing pricing schemes currently implemented on crowdsourcing websites, in order to improve the performance of the non-cooperative equilibria emerging in such applications. We first formulate the exchanges on a crowdsourcing website as a two-sided market where requesters and workers are matched and play gift-giving games repeatedly. Subsequently, we study the protocol designer's problem of finding an optimal and sustainable (equilibrium) protocol which achieves the highest social welfare for that website. We prove that the proposed incentives protocol can make the website operate close to Pareto efficiency. Moreover, we also examine an alternative scenario, where the protocol designer aims at maximizing the revenue of the website and evaluate the performance of the optimal protocol.","0743-166X","978-1-4673-0775-8","10.1109/INFCOM.2012.6195597","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6195597","","Protocols;Pricing;Games;Analytical models;Electrical engineering;USA Councils;Educational institutions","","213","","17","IEEE","10 May 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Nowadays, vehicles have also been increasingly adopted as participants in crowd-sourcing applications. Different from smartphones, vehicles have the distinct advantage of predictable mobility, which brings new insight into improving the crowdsourcing quality. Unfortunately, utilizing the predictable mobility in participant recruitment poses a new challenge of considering not only current location but also the future trajectories of participants. Therefore, existing participant recruitment algorithms that only use the current location may not perform well. In this paper, based on the predicted trajectory, we present a new participant recruitment strategy for vehicle-based crowdsourcing. This strategy guarantees that the system can perform well using the currently recruited participants for a period of time in the future. The participant recruitment problem is proven to be NP-complete, and we propose two algorithms, a greedy approximation and a genetic algorithm, to find the solution for different application scenarios. The performance of our algorithms is demonstrated with traffic trace dataset. The results show that our algorithms outperform some existing approaches in terms of the crowdsourcing quality.","0743-166X","978-1-4799-8381-0","10.1109/INFOCOM.2015.7218644","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7218644","","Crowdsourcing;Vehicles;Trajectory;Approximation algorithms;Algorithm design and analysis;Recruitment;Monitoring","","138","","23","IEEE","24 Aug 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A spatial crowdsourcing system periodically matches a number of locationbased workers with nearby spatial tasks (e.g., taking photos or videos at some specific locations). Previous studies on spatial crowdsourcing focus on task assignment strategies that maximize an assignment score based solely on the available information about workers/tasks at the time of assignment. These strategies can only achieve local optimality by neglecting the workers/tasks that may join the system in a future time. In contrast, in this paper, we aim to improve the global assignment, by considering both present and future (via predictions) workers/tasks. In particular, we formalize a new optimization problem, namely maximum quality task assignment (MQA). The optimization objective of MQA is to maximize a global assignment quality score, under a traveling budget constraint. To tackle this problem, we design an effective grid-based prediction method to estimate the spatial distributions of workers/tasks in the future, and then utilize the predictions to assign workers to tasks at any given time instance. We prove that the MQA problem is NPhard, and thus intractable. Therefore, we propose efficient heuristics to tackle the MQA problem, including MQA greedy and MQA divide-and-conquer approaches, which can efficiently assign workers to spatial tasks with high quality scores and low budget consumptions.

In this paper, we consider an important spatial crowdsourcing problem, namely cooperation-aware spatial crowdsourcing (CA-SC), where spatial tasks (e.g., collecting the Wi-Fi signal strength in one building) are time-constrained and require more than one worker to complete thus the cooperation among assigned workers is essential to the result. Our CA-SC problem is to assign workers to spatial tasks such that the overall cooperation quality is maximized. We prove that the CA-SC problem is NP-hard by reducing from the k-set packing problem, thus intractable.

Particularly, locations of workers and tasks should be properly processed via certain privacy mechanism before reporting to the untrusted spatial crowdsourcing server for task assignment. Privacy mechanisms typically permute the location information, which tends to make task assignment ineffective. Prior studies only provide guarantees on privacy protection without assuring the effectiveness of task assignment. In this paper, we investigate privacy protection for online task assignment with the objective of minimizing the total distance, an important task assignment formulation in spatial crowdsourcing. We design a novel privacy mechanism based on Hierarchically Well-Separated Trees (HSTs). We prove that the mechanism is ε-Geo-Indistinguishable and show that there is a task assignment algorithm with a competitive ratio of O(ε1/4 log N log2 k), where ε is the privacy budget, N is the number of predefined points on the HST, and k is the matching size.

In a crowdsourcing system, a large group of “workers” solve the tasks outsourced by “requesters”. To make a crowdsourcing system sustainable, it is vital to attract users (both requesters and workers) to participate, and incentivize high-quality solutions. To achieve this objective, we design an effective incentive mechanism and reputation protocol. Our design incorporates various important elements of a crowdsourcing system such as workers having heterogeneous skill sets (i.e., some are “experts” while others are “novices”), and task assignment process, rating system, etc. Our incentive mechanism is composed of a rating system and a reward dividing scheme, and requires the system administrator to divide the reward based on requesters' rating on the solution quality. We derive the minimum reward needed so that “expert” workers are guaranteed provide high-quality solutions. We show that “novice” workers provide low-quality solutions, and our reputation protocol eliminates this undesirable behavior by tracking a worker's solution history and penalizing him when his reputation is poor. We apply repeated game-theoretic frameworks to quantify the impact of this reputation protocol on requesters' cost in guaranteeing high quality solutions.","","978-1-4799-8009-3","10.1109/ALLERTON.2014.7028448","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7028448","","Crowdsourcing;Protocols;Games;Waste materials;Indexes;History;Google","","34","","28","IEEE","2 Feb 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Specifically, one task can only be dispatched when its dependent tasks have already been assigned. In fact, task dependencies are quite common in many real-life applications, such as house repairing and holding sports games. We formally define the dependency-aware spatial crowdsourcing (DA-SC), which focuses on finding an optimal worker-and-task assignment under the constraints of dependencies, skills of workers, moving distances and deadlines to maximize the successfully assigned tasks.

However, existing rating systems are facing challenges such as providing limited information regarding worker's abilities as well as potential threats from workers' gaming or cheating the systems. To develop better understanding of worker performance in software crowdsourcing, this paper reports an empirical study at TopCoder, one of the primary software crowdsourcing platforms. We aim at investigating the following questions: How diverse are crowd workers in terms of skill and experience? How fast do crowd workers respond to a task call? How reliable are crowd workers in submitting tasks? And how much does CSD benefit schedule reduction? The main results of this study showed that on average, (i) 59% of workers respond to a task call in the first 24 hours, (ii) 24% of the workers who registered early will make submissions to tasks, and 76% of them exceeding the acceptance criteria, and (iii) an overall average of 1.82 schedule acceleration rate is observed through organizing mass parallel development in 4 software crowdsourcing projects.

For example, the task requester may not want to disclose the task content to unauthorized users, and the participants may not want to disclose their locations to untrusted server. To address these issues, we propose a Privacy-Preserving Task Allocation for Spatial Crowdsourcing (PTA-SC) scheme in this paper. In PTASC, regions and locations can be encoded into a set of prefixes based on the prefix encoding method. The location-induced prefixes are treated as attributes and the region-induced prefixes are used to generate an access policy tree for a ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption (CP-ABE) scheme. PTA-SC can check whether a location is inside an SC task region by evaluating if the attributes satisfy the access policy tree or not.

To guarantee truthfulness, auction has been regarded as a promising form to charge requesters and reward workers. In this paper, we consider an online task assignment scenario, where each worker has a set of experienced skills, whereas specific task is budget-constrained and requires certain skill. Under this scenario, we model the crowdsourcing task assignment as a reverse auction in which requesters are buyers and workers are sellers. Specially, our paper studies simple task case where the requester ask for single skill. We propose TMC-VCG and TMC-ST and prove the related properties for the mechanisms theoretically. Meanwhile, through extensive simulations, we verify the truthfulness and also evaluate other performance.","2159-6190","978-1-5386-1993-3","10.1109/CLOUD.2017.72","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8030629","Crowdsourcing;task assignment;auction;truthful","Crowdsourcing;Mechanical factors;Algorithm design and analysis;Economics;Heuristic algorithms;Cost accounting;Cloud computing","","8","","26","IEEE","11 Sep 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It is also a fairly widespread practice to control the contributions of users based on the quality of their input. This paper points to the fact that applying this practice in subjective assessment tasks may lead to an undesired, negative outcome. We present a crowdsourcing experiment and a discussion of the ways in which control in crowdsourcing studies can lead to a phenomenon akin to a self-fulfilling prophecy. This paper is intended to trigger discussion and lead to more deeply reflective crowdsourcing practices in the multimedia context.","1949-3991","978-1-4673-8695-1","10.1109/CBMI.2016.7500256","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7500256","","Crowdsourcing;Multimedia communication;Quality of service;Cameras;Distortion;Standards;Physiology","","7","","27","IEEE","30 Jun 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Agent-based modeling (ABM) is a natural way to study complex systems since they share common properties, such as the global behavior emerging on the basis of local interactions between elements. Although significant attention has been given to dynamics of crowdsourcing systems, relatively little is known about how workers react to varying configurations of tasks. In addition, existing ABMs for crowdsourcing systems are theoretical, and not based on data from real crowdsourcing platforms. The focus of this paper is on capturing the relationships among properties of tasks, characteristics of workers, and performance metrics via an ABM. This approach is validated by running experiments on Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT).","1558-4305","978-1-4799-7486-3","10.1109/WSC.2014.7019907","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7019907","","Crowdsourcing;Measurement;Accuracy;Technological innovation;Predictive models;Data models;Testing","","7","","25","IEEE","26 Jan 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The objective of spatial crowdsourcing is to outsource a set of spatio-temporal tasks to a set of workers, which requires the workers to be physically traveling to the tasks' locations in order to perform them, i.e., taking photos or collecting real time weather information at prespecified location. However, the crowd workers privacy could be compromised by disclosing their locations to untrusted parties. This paper aims to provide a brief description of spatial crowdsourcing and highlight its privacy concerns. Thereafter, it demonstrates the common attacks in the location privacy of spatial crowdsourcing.","2154-0373","978-1-5386-5398-2","10.1109/EIT.2018.8500311","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8500311","","Task analysis;Crowdsourcing;Privacy;Servers;Real-time systems;Meteorology;Public transportation","","7","","36","IEEE","21 Oct 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, users always pursue the maximum benefits with the least effort, which may lead to the low quality of solutions submitted by receivers. In addition, each user is most concerned about their own benefits, and sometimes they do not objectively evaluate the solutions. Based on blockchain technology, this paper implements crowdsourcing process through smart contract, and proposes credit and arbitration mechanisms suitable for general online industrial services. To be specific, the credit mechanism defines the historical reputation of each user through credit score, which is beneficial for the sender to find a satisfactory receiver, and provides criteria for the selection of members of the arbitration institution. We also combine punishment and incentive measures to ensure the earnest implementation of the crowdsourcing business by users. Arbitration mechanism refers to the arbitration of task solutions submitted by receivers through the decentralized and credible arbitration institution rather than senders or the crowdsourcing platform, which ensures the fairness and impartiality of the solution evaluation. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed credit mechanism and arbitration mechanism.","","978-1-7281-1298-5","10.1109/ISASS.2019.8757776","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8757776","Blockchain;crowdsourcing;smart contracts;credit;arbitration","Routing;Proposals;Reinforcement learning;Optical fiber networks;Quality of service;IP networks;Network topology","","6","","9","IEEE","11 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Crowdsourcing is facing new challenges to handle the increase of information in real-time from a vast number of sources in Internet-of-Things (IoT) scenarios. Thus we seek to leverage the power of social web, smart-devices, sensors, etc., fusing these heterogeneous sources into distributed context information in order to enable novel crowdsourcing scenarios. This mandates research in efficient management of heterogeneous and distributed context information through logical-clustering. Logical-clustering can efficiently filter out similar context information obtained from distributed sources based on context similarity. However, the efficiency of logical-clustering is challenged by the distribution of context information in crowdsourcing scenarios. Publish/Subscribe mechanism can counter this challenge. To this end, we propose a scalable publish/subscribe model, MediaSense, which is based on p2p technologies. This paper presents our approach to a scalable logical-clustering concept. The evaluation of our approach applied to MediaSense can achieve a rate of approximately 3530 messages/sec for publish/subscribe events. Moreover, this approach further achieves 99% increase for subscription matching and 163% improvement in memory requirements in comparison with other approaches.","","978-0-9893193-1-7","10.1109/SAI.2014.6918173","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6918173","crowdsourcing;pervasive computing;context information;logical-clustering;Publish/Subscribe;MediaSense","Context;Crowdsourcing;Subscriptions;Real-time systems;Sensors;Registers","","6","1","17","","9 Oct 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

One key feature in providing the service is the crowdsourcing in which the principal obtains essential data from a large group of users, and inversely sharing the data based service with everyone for free. In this paper, we investigate the problem of how to provide continuous incentives for users to participate in the crowdsourcing activity, which can be referred to the moral hazard problem in the contract theory. First, a performance related incentive mechanism is proposed. Then, the utility maximization problem of the principal is formulated, under the constraint that each user maximizes its own utility by choosing the optimal effort in the crowdsourcing activity. Finally, the numerical results show that by using the proposed incentive mechanism, the users obtains the continuous incentives to participate in the crowdsourcing activity, and the principal successfully maximize the utilities.","1558-2612","978-1-4799-8406-0","10.1109/WCNC.2015.7127789","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7127789","","Crowdsourcing;Remuneration;Ethics;Hazards;Contracts;Wireless networks;Standards","","6","","10","IEEE","18 Jun 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
