However, our study of Stack Overflow questions reveals the low utilization of high-quality programming tutorials, which is caused task description mismatch and code information overload. Neither document search nor recently proposed activity-centric search can address these two barriers. In this work, we enrich the programming task knowledge graph with actions extracted from comments in code examples and more forms of activity sentences. To overcome the task description mismatch problem, we use code matching based task search method to find relevant programming tasks and code examples to the code under development. We integrate our knowledge graph and task search method in the IDE, and develop an observe-push based tool to prompt developers with API usage examples in explicit task contexts. To alleviate the code information overload problem, our tool highlights programming task and API information in the prompted tutorial excerpts and code examples based on the underlying knowledge graph. Our evaluation confirms the high quality of the constructed knowledge graph, and show that our code matching based task search can recommend effective code solutions to programming issues asked on Stack Overflow.

Asking for the help of colleagues, browsing the official documentation, or accessing online resources, such as Stack Overflow, can clearly help in this ""code comprehension"" activity that, however, still remains highly time-consuming and is not always successful. Enhancing this process has been addressed in different studies under the subject of automatic documentation of software artifacts. For example, ""recommender systems"" have been designed with the goal of retrieving and suggesting relevant pieces of information (e.g., Stack Overflow discussions) for a given piece of code inspected in an IDE. However, these techniques rely on limited contextual information, mainly solely source code. Our goal is to build a context-aware proactive recommender system supporting the code comprehension process. The system must be able to understand the context, consider the developer's profile, and help her by generating pieces of documentation at whatever granularity is required, e.g., going from summarizing the responsibilities implemented in a subsystem, to explaining how two classes collaborate to implement a functionality, down to documenting a single line of code. Generated documentation will be tailored for the current context (e.g., the task at hand, the developer's background knowledge, the history of interactions). In this paper we present our first steps toward our goal by introducing the ADANA project, a framework which generates fine-grained code comments for a given piece of code.","2576-3148","978-1-5386-7870-1","10.1109/ICSME.2018.00090","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8530093","software documentation;program comprehension;context-aware;recommender system","Documentation;Recommender systems;Task analysis;Software;Knowledge based systems;Data mining;Cloning","","3","","46","IEEE","11 Nov 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

By manually analyzing 586 highly relevant posts spanning 14 years, we observed a large variety (11 categories) of issues, dominated by those with interfacing and data handling among different languages. Behind these issues, we found that a major challenge developers faced is the diversity and complexity in multilingual code building and interoperability. Another key challenge lies in developers' lack of particular technical background on the diverse features of various languages (e.g., threading and memory management mechanisms). Meanwhile, Stack Overflow itself served as a key source of solutions to these challenges-the majority (73%) of the posts received accepted answers eventually, and most in a week (36.5% within 24 hours and 25% in the next 6 days).

However, external APIs are not guaranteed to contain every desirable feature, nor are they immune to software defects. Therefore, API users will sometimes be faced with situations where a current API does not satisfy all of their requirements, but migrating to another API is costly. In these cases, due to the lack of communication channels between API developers and users, API users may intentionally bypass an existing API after inquiring into workarounds for their API problems with online communities. This mechanism takes the API developer out of the conversation, potentially leaving API defects unreported and desirable API features undiscovered. In this paper we explore API workaround inquiries from API users on Stack Overflow. We uncover general reasons why API users inquire about API workarounds, and general solutions to API workaround requests. Furthermore, using workaround implementations in Stack Overflow answers, we develop three API workaround implementation patterns. We identify instances of these patterns in real-life open source projects and determine their value for API developers from their responses to feature requests based on the identified API workarounds.","1558-1225","978-1-4503-7121-6","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9283953","software maintenance;API workarounds;Mining software repositories;Empirical software engineering","Knowledge engineering;Communication channels;Feature extraction;Software;Software engineering","","2","","74","","21 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Developers also need to search for analogical libraries across programming languages when developing applications in different languages or for different platforms. However, manually searching for analogical libraries is a time-consuming and difficult task. This paper presents a technique, called XLibRec, that recommends analogical libraries across different programming languages. XLibRec collects Stack Overflow question titles containing library names, library usage information from Stack Overflow posts, and library descriptions from a third party website, Libraries.io. We generate word-vectors for each information and calculate a weight-based cosine similarity score from them to recommend analogical libraries. We performed an extensive evaluation using a large number of analogical libraries across four different programming languages. Results from our evaluation show that the proposed technique can recommend cross-language analogical libraries with great accuracy. The precision for the Top-3 recommendations ranges from 62-81% and has achieved 8-45% higher precision than the state-of-the-art technique.","1534-5351","978-1-6654-3786-8","10.1109/SANER53432.2022.00109","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9825781","Cross-Language;Analogical Libraries;Stack Overflow;Library Usage Information;Word2Vec","Computer languages;Conferences;Wheels;Libraries;Software;Data mining;Task analysis","","2","","63","IEEE","21 Jul 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For cross-lingual question retrieval, one may use translation-based methods that first translate the non-English queries into English and then perform monolingual question retrieval in English. However, translation-based methods suffer from semantic deviation due to inappropriate translation, especially for domain-specific terms, and lexical gap between queries and questions that share few words in common. To overcome the above issues, we propose a novel cross-lingual question retrieval based on word embed-dings and convolutional neural network (CNN) which are the state-of-the-art deep learning techniques to capture word- and sentence-level semantics. The CNN model is trained with large amounts of examples from Stack Overflow duplicate questions and their corresponding translation by machine, which guides the CNN to learn to capture informative word and sentence features to recognize and quantify semantic similarity in the presence of semantic deviations and lexical gaps. A uniqueness of our approach is that the trained CNN can map documents in two languages (e.g., Chinese queries and English questions) in a dual-language vector space, and thus reduce the cross-lingual question retrieval problem to a simple k-nearest neighbors search problem in the dual-language vector space, where no query or question translation is required. Our evaluation shows that our approach significantly outperforms the translation-based method, and can be extended to dual-language documents retrieval from different sources.","","978-1-4503-3845-5","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7582810","Cross-lingual question retrieval;Word embeddings;Convolutional Neural Network;Dual-Language Vector Space","Semantics;Neural networks;Context;Google;Inspection;Predictive models;Convolution","","2","1","47","","6 Oct 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Despite their usefulness, LLMs still fall short of human performance. To tackle this issue, we propose leveraging symmetric Metamorphic Relations (MRs) to enhance LLMs’ performance by improving their machine common sense. The goal is to ensure that learners receive more relevant content. This work presents an empirical experiment using one specific symmetric MR, three LLMs, and a publicly available dataset of labelled Stack Overflow data. We employ the symmetric MR to generate training data that augments the machine common sense of LLMs. Additionally, we prepare a separate set of training data consisting of labelled Stack Overflow data for comparison purposes. By comparing the results of a common ability test and the predictions made by LLMs trained with different training datasets, we can assess the potential practicality of our proposed approach. Our experimental results demonstrate that a Bert-based LLM trained with MR-generated data outperforms a Bert-based LLM trained solely with regular labelled data. This outcome highlights the effectiveness of symmetric MRs in enhancing LLMs’ performance by improving their machine common sense. Subsequent studies can extend our approach to other domains related to education technology and explore additional MRs to further enhance the study experience of students.","2766-2144","979-8-3503-6141-4","10.1109/ISET61814.2024.00017","University of Hong Kong; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10685687","Content quality prediction;large language model;question-answering (Q&A) website;metamorphic relations;machine common sense;natural language processing data augmentation","Training;Large language models;Training data;Educational technology;Predictive models;Data augmentation;Data models","","","","35","IEEE","26 Sep 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A single question can be asked in different ways with different wordings, leading to the existence of duplicate posts on technical forums. The question of how to discover and link duplicate posts has garnered the attention of both developer communities and researchers. For example, Stack Overflow adopts a voting-based mechanism to mark and close duplicate posts. However, addressing these constantly emerging duplicate posts in a timely manner continues to pose challenges. Therefore, various approaches have been proposed to detect duplicate posts on technical forum posts automatically. The existing methods suffer from limitations either due to their reliance on handcrafted similarity metrics which can not sufficiently capture the semantics of posts, or their lack of supervision (i.e., leveraging existing duplicate annotations) to improve the performance. Additionally, the efficiency of these methods is hindered by their dependence on pair-wise feature generation, which can be impractical for large amount of data. In this work, we attempt to employ and refine the GPT-3 embeddings for the duplicate detection task. We assume that the GPT-3 embeddings can accurately represent the semantics of the posts. In addition, by training a Siamese-based network based on the GPT-3 embeddings, we obtain a latent embedding that accurately captures the duplicate relation in technical forum posts. Our experiment on a benchmark dataset confirms the effectiveness of our approach and demonstrates superior performance compared to baseline methods. When applied to the dataset we constructed with a recent Stack Overflow dump, our approach attains a Top-1, Top-5, and Top-30 accuracy of 23.1 %, 43.9 %, and 68.9 %, respectively. With a manual study, we confirm our approach's potential of finding unlabelled duplicates on technical forums.

The questions posted on the Stack Overflow forum by a user requires a minimum of 1 tag to be manually entered in by them. Tagging most commonly means to associate some single word information about the context of given text or question. Tagging a question is useful in identifying the category that a question or text belongs. It is also beneficial in providing ease of access to a person having a requirement of specific categories of questions. On analysis of tags associated with the questions on the website, it was found that a large number of the questions are labelled by more than one tags, with many of them not being tagged accurately. Due to this situation, it becomes challenging for the users to search for relevant tags. So, the main aim of this research task is to explore methods and compare different techniques in order to create an auto tagging system with the aid of Machine learning and deep learning facilities, accompanied by data preprocessing steps. The dataset for this purpose was taken from Kaggle, known as StackSample dataset, which is a dataset containing 10 percent of the questions present on the website.

Usually, programmers search for relevant/desired code by using natural language queries through search engines. However, the reusable code is very different from the normal textual searches. The main aim of code retrieval is to search for the most relevant snippet from a corpus of code snippets. The only way to efficiently retrieve the most relevant results is to eliminate the semantic gap between the code snippets and the user’s query (Natural language description) search in the repository. Bridging this gap is an immense challenge. The primary objective of the research is to retrieve code snippets that are semantically relevant to the user query and to provide programmers with the ability to locate source code that they can use when developing new applications. The proposed approach is implemented using a web platform through which users can search source code. In this research, a semantic model for code retrieval is used which generates meanings or synonyms of the words. The proposed model integrates Ontologies and Natural Language Processing. The proposed approach is evaluated on the dataset extracted from Stack Overflow. The performance measures and classification accuracy are computed using Mean Average Precision. The retrieved results are ranked using Levenshtein similarity, demonstrating that our approach outperforms a robust component matching significantly. Our evaluation shows that the use of semantic matching leads to improve retrieval effectiveness. This study marks a substantial advancement in the integration of programming expertise with code retrieval techniques.

In addition, there does not exist a finely annotated dataset for our purpose. In this paper, we constructed a dataset containing 4,322 labelled question pairs in Chinese, which is, to the best of our knowledge, the first open Chinese dataset for question similarity classification. We propose a novel framework for measuring the semantic similarity between sentences based on the architecture of a recurrent neural network (RNN) encoderdecoder, which does not require lexical or syntactic resources. We solve the problem of lacking labelled data by first training the RNN using a larger dataset of question pairs that are automatically labelled with heuristic scores, and then fine-tuning it with our smaller, manually labelled dataset.

Currently, with the amount of participants and documents increasing rapidly in CQA websites, how to parallel expert finding algorithms for big data analysis has received significant attention. In this paper, we find that the Spark framework is more suitable for paralleling expert finding algorithms than the MapReduce framework, which is a memory-based parallel computing model to support complicated iterative algorithms. As an example, we parallel ZhihuRank using MLlib's LDA and GraphX's PageRank in Spark. Experiments have been conducted on large-scale real data from Zhihu1 (the most popular CQA website in China). And the experimental results confirmed the effectiveness and scalability of our proposed approach.","","978-1-4673-9005-7","10.1109/BigData.2016.7841019","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7841019","Expert Finding;Community Question Answering;LDA;PageRank;Distributed Computing","Sparks;Algorithm design and analysis;Machine learning algorithms;Heuristic algorithms;Programming;Computational modeling;Libraries","","1","","22","IEEE","6 Feb 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In CQA, one key issue is to recommend users with high expertise and willingness to answer the given questions, namely expert recommendation. However, most of existing methods for expert recommendation ignore some key information, such as time information and historical feedback information, degrading the performance. On the one hand, users' interest are changing over time. It is biased if we don't consider the dynamics. On the other hand, feedback information is critical to estimate users' expertise. To solve these problems, we propose a unified framework for expert recommendation to exploit user interest and expertise more precisely. Considering the inconsistency between them, we propose to learn their embeddings separately. We leverage Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to model user's short-term interest and combine it with long-term interest. The user expertise is learned by the designed user expertise network, which explicitly models feedback on users' historical behavior. The extensive experiments on a large-scale dataset from a realworld CQA site demonstrate the superior performance of our method than state-of-the-art solutions to the problem.","1051-4651","978-1-7281-8808-9","10.1109/ICPR48806.2021.9412018","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9412018","","Knowledge discovery;Pattern recognition","","1","","22","IEEE","5 May 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

From this categorization, we conducted a user study of the results obtained from three Web SE, and three Communities QA. In this way, we found that SE result in a better alternative when the query is designed to get a uni-objective answer, while communities QA provide better results if the question gets multi-objective answers. On the other hand, when the query expects a subjective answer, none of these systems provides a very effective answer that can fulfill the expectations from the user.

Web service selection (WSS) is often required to provide concurrent CQA services. WSS involves energy consumption of servers. However, existing techniques rarely consider energy consumption when dealing with concurrent WSS. To bridge this gap, we propose the mixed-integer optimization based green service selection (MIOGSS) for large-scale concurrent CQA service, which minimizes energy consumption and satisfies the common QoS of task response time. We focus on applying MIOGSS to service discovery and evaluation when dealing with concurrent request tasks. First, we propose a method to discover service candidates according to request tasks. Task de-duplication is used to reduce redundant tasks. Second, we apply a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) to evaluate service candidates by trading off their energy consumption, execution and transmission time. Third, we develop a cost model to optimize MILP, which decreases the search space of service evaluation. Consequently, a MIOGSS enabled large-scale concurrent CQA system is developed for selecting appropriate services with minimum MILP value to answer concurrent user requests. Experiments show that MIOGSS performs well in energy saving and guarantees the quality of the large-scale concurrent CQA service.","","978-1-4673-9808-4","10.1109/SKG.2015.25","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7429354","Large-scale CQA service;Green service selection;MILP optimization;task de-duplication","Energy consumption;Servers;Web services;Quality of service;Time factors;Optimization;Electronic mail","","","","21","IEEE","10 Mar 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Unfortunately, most documents are stored and distributed as PDF or scanned images, which fail to preserve logical table structure. Recent vision-based deep learning approaches have been proposed to address this gap, but most still cannot achieve state-of-the-art results. We present Global Table Extractor (GTE), a vision-guided systematic framework for joint table detection and cell structured recognition, which could be built on top of any object detection model. With GTE-Table, we invent a new penalty based on the natural cell containment constraint of tables to train our table network aided by cell location predictions. GTE-Cell is a new hierarchical cell detection network that leverages table styles. Further, we design a method to automatically label table and cell structure in existing documents to cheaply create a large corpus of training and test data. We use this to enhance PubTabNet with cell labels and create FinTabNet, real-world and complex scientific and financial datasets with detailed table structure annotations to help train and test structure recognition. Our framework surpasses previous state-of-the-art results on the ICDAR 2013 and ICDAR 2019 table competition in both table detection and cell structure recognition. Further experiments demonstrate a greater than 45% improvement in cell structure recognition when compared to a vanilla RetinaNet object detection model in our new out-of-domain FinTabNet.","2642-9381","978-1-6654-0477-8","10.1109/WACV48630.2021.00074","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9423317","","Training;Deep learning;Visualization;Computer vision;Systematics;Design methodology;Conferences","","63","","36","IEEE","14 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Using the lens of a requirements-centred social network to group team members who work on a particular requirement, we collected data to characterize requirements-centric collaborations in a project, and to examine aspects of awareness of requirements changes within these networks. Our findings indicate organic patterns of collaboration involving considerable cross-site interaction, in which communication of changes was the most predominant reason for interaction. Although we did not find evidence that distance affects developers' awareness of remote team members who work on the same requirements, distance affected how accessible the remote colleagues were. We discuss implications for knowledge sharing and coordination of work on a requirement in distributed teams, and propose directions for the design of collaboration tools that support awareness in distributed requirements management.","2332-6441","978-0-7695-2935-6","10.1109/RE.2007.51","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4384168","","Social network services;Collaborative work;Collaborative software;International collaboration;Programming;Environmental management;Computer industry;Lenses;Collaborative tools;Knowledge management","","58","","11","IEEE","19 Nov 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These features impact how GitHub is used and the benefits it provides to teams' development and collaboration. While most of the evidence we have is from GitHub's use in open source software (OSS) projects, GitHub is also used in an increasing number of commercial projects. It is unknown how GitHub supports these projects given that GitHub's workflow model does not intuitively fit the commercial development way of working. In this paper, we report findings from an online survey and interviews with GitHub users on how GitHub is used for collaboration in commercial projects.

To further investigate the presence of these benefits, we surveyed members of popular OSS communities who were involved with peer code review. We used established scales from Psychology, Information science, and Organizational Behavior to create survey questions. We also enforced multiple reliability and validity measures to ensure higher confidence in the survey results. In this paper, we present a subset of the surveys results focused on better understanding four aspects of peer impression formation: trust, reliability, perception of expertise, and friendship. The results indicate that there is indeed a high level of trust, reliability, perception of expertise, and friendship between OSS peers who have participated in code review for a period of time.

The value of training on this MORPHed data is tested via a 10-way within learning study and a cross learning study using Random Forests, Naive Bayes, and Logistic Regression for ten object-oriented defect datasets from the PROMISE data repository. Measured in terms of exposure of sensitive attributes, the MORPHed data was four times more private than the unMORPHed data. Also, in terms of the f-measures, there was little difference between the MORPHed and unMORPHed data (original data and data privatized by data-swapping) for both the cross and within study.

In this paper, we investigate knowledge sharing across categories for action recognition in videos. The motivation is that many action categories are related, where common motion pattern are shared among them (e.g. diving and high jump share the jump motion). We propose a new multi-task learning method to learn latent tasks shared across categories, and reconstruct a classifier for each category from these latent tasks. Compared to previous methods, our approach has two advantages: (1) The learned latent tasks correspond to basic motion patterns instead of full actions, thus enhancing discrimination power of the classifiers. (2) Categories are selected to share information with a sparsity regularizer, avoiding falsely forcing all categories to share knowledge. Experimental results on multiple public data sets show that the proposed approach can effectively transfer knowledge between different action categories to improve the performance of conventional single task learning methods.","2380-7504","978-1-4799-2840-8","10.1109/ICCV.2013.281","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6751392","Latent Task;Action Recognition","Visualization;Optimization;Videos;Pattern recognition;Data models;Learning systems;Vectors","","37","","33","IEEE","3 Mar 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Agile teams are cross-functional teams that promote sharing of project-specific knowledge through frequent faceto-face interaction, effective communication and customer collaboration. Knowledge sharing is difficult for distributed Agile teams due to spatial, temporal, and cultural barriers, which negatively affect face-to-face interaction, communication and collaboration. There seems to be very few studies that focus on knowledge management in distributed Agile teams. Through a Grounded Theory study that involved 45 participants from 28 different software companies in the USA, India and Australia, we investigate distributed software development from the specific perspective of Agile teams.

In this paper, we describe a new paradigm for programming an NCPS that enables users to specify their needs and nodes to contribute capabilities and resources. This new paradigm is based on the partially ordered knowledge-sharing model that makes explicit the abstract structure of a computation in space and time. Based on this model, we propose an application framework that provides a uniform abstraction for a wide range of NCPS applications, especially those concerned with distributed sensing, optimization, and control. The proposed framework provides a generic service to represent, manipulate, and share knowledge across the network under minimal assumptions on connectivity. Our framework is tested on a new distributed version of an evolutionary optimization algorithm that runs on a computing cluster and is also used to solve a dynamic distributed optimization problem in a simulated NCPS that uses mobile robots as controllable data mules.","","978-1-4244-9719-5","10.1109/EUC.2010.30","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5703510","Networked Cyper-Physical Systems;Knowledge Sharing;Application Framework","Robot sensing systems;Computational modeling;Knowledge engineering;Optimization;Robot kinematics;Heuristic algorithms","","25","","35","IEEE","28 Jan 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

While some research into users' motives to adopt social software in the private realm exists, the body of empirical studies on ESSP adoption is rather limited. Our research objective therefore is to contribute to closing this gap in research by determining the factors influencing employees' ESSP usage. Building on previous research, we present an ESSP adoption model. We then propose an according measurement instrument for empirically assessing the factors influencing ESSP usage.

In general, there are two ways for multi-task learning. One is to exploit the small set of labeled data from all tasks to learn a shared feature space for knowledge sharing. In this way, the focus is on the labeled training samples while the large amount of unlabeled data is not sufficiently considered. Another way has a focus on how to share model parameters among multiple tasks based on the original features space. Here, the question is whether it is possible to combine the advantages of both approaches and develop a method, which can simultaneously learn a shared subspace for multiple tasks and learn the prediction models in this subspace? To this end, in this paper, we propose a feature representation learning framework, which has the ability in combining the autoencoders, an effective way to learn good representation by using large amount of unlabeled data, and model parameter regularization methods into a unified model for multi-task learning. Specifically, all the tasks share the same encoding and decoding weights to find their latent feature representations, based on which a regularized multi-task softmax regression method is used to find a distinct prediction model for each task. Also, some commonalities are considered in the prediction models according to the relatedness of multiple tasks. There are several advantages of the proposed model: 1) it can make full use of large amount of unlabeled data from all the tasks to learn satisfying representations, 2) the learning of distinct prediction models can benefit from the success of autoencoder, 3) since we incorporate the labeled information into the softmax regression method, so the learning of feature representation is indeed in a semi-supervised manner. Therefore, our model is a semi-supervised autoencoder for multi-task learning (SAML for short). Finally, extensive experiments on three real-world data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. Moreover, the feature representation obtained in this model can be used by other methods to obtain improved results.","1550-4786","978-1-4673-9504-5","10.1109/ICDM.2015.22","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7373449","Multi-task learning;Representation Learning;Autoencoder;Semi-supervised Learning","Training;Data models;Predictive models;Encoding;Decoding;Organizations;Logistics","","22","2","22","IEEE","7 Jan 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The Research Object has recently emerged as a comprehensive and systematic method for aggregation and identification of diverse elements of computational experiments. While a necessary method, mere aggregation is not sufficient for the sharing of computational experiments. Other users must be able to easily recompute on these shared research objects.

Recent studies have shown that statistical language models can improve the performance of code completion tools through learning from large-scale software repositories. However, these models suffer from three major drawbacks: a) The hierarchical structural information of the programs is not fully utilized in the program's representation; b) In programs, the semantic relationships can be very long. Existing recurrent neural networks based language models are not sufficient to model the long-term dependency. c) Existing approaches perform a specific task in one model, which leads to the underuse of the information from related tasks. To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose a selfattentional neural architecture for code completion with multi-task learning. To utilize the hierarchical structural information of the programs, we present a novel method that considers the path from the predicting node to the root node. To capture the long-term dependency in the input programs, we adopt a self-attentional architecture based network as the base language model. To enable the knowledge sharing between related tasks, we creatively propose a Multi-Task Learning (MTL) framework to learn two related tasks in code completion jointly.

Interoperability among different ontologies becomes essential to gain from the power of the existing domain ontologies.

Other than concept descriptors, the semantic relations in the ontology like IS-A, HAS-PART etc. are also associated a strength of association. The strength of association between two concepts determines the ""uniformity"" with which these two concepts have been defined identically across different ontologies.

Surprisingly, we find that a user's reputation does not directly motivate contribution. It is the relative reputation (ranking) that serves as the motivation. This finding highlights the importance of peer effect and social comparison in the incentive design of open collaboration platforms. Our study provides implications for platform designers on how to motivate community participants and build sustainable online knowledge communities.","1530-1605","978-1-4799-7367-5","10.1109/HICSS.2015.452","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7070269","online community;knowledge collaboration;user contributions;virtual rewards;reputation","Communities;Collaboration;Context;Technological innovation;Internet;Silver;Cost accounting","","17","2","26","IEEE","30 Mar 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In recent literature, it is shown that pre-trained GANs, on a different dataset, can be transferred to improve the image generation from a small target data. The same, however, has not been well-studied in the case of conditional GANs (cGANs), which provides new opportunities for knowledge transfer compared to unconditional setup. In particular, the new classes may borrow knowledge from the related old classes, or share knowledge among themselves to improve the training. This motivates us to study the problem of efficient conditional GAN transfer with knowledge propagation across classes. To address this problem, we introduce a new GAN transfer method to explicitly propagate the knowledge from the old classes to the new classes. The key idea is to enforce the popularly used conditional batch normalization (BN) to learn the class-specific information of the new classes from that of the old classes, with implicit knowledge sharing among the new ones. This allows for an efficient knowledge propagation from the old classes to the new ones, with the BN parameters increasing linearly with the number of new classes. The extensive evaluation demonstrates the clear superiority of the proposed method over state-of-the-art competitors for efficient conditional GAN transfer tasks.

With the increasing number of distributed multi-robots, such smart environment generates unprecedented amounts of data. Robotic applications are faced with challenges of such big data: the serious real-time assurance and data privacy. Therefore, in order to obtain the big data values via knowledge sharing under the premise of ensuring the real-time data processing and data privacy, we propose a real-time data processing architecture for multi-robots based on the differential federated learning, called RT-robots architecture. A global shared model with differential privacy protection is trained on the cloud iteratively and distributed to multiple edge robots in each round, and the robotic tasks are processed locally in real time. Our implementation and experiments demonstrate that our architecture can be applied on multiple robotic recognition tasks, balance the trade-off between the performance and privacy.","","978-1-5386-9380-3","10.1109/SmartWorld.2018.00106","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8560084","Real time;ubiquitous intelligence;multi robots;federated learning;differential privacy","","","15","","36","IEEE","6 Dec 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In order to achieve higher reputations and better performance, academic teams with leaders are constructed to speed up knowledge sharing and problem solving. It is significant to explore team-based issues with the increasing interests of information exploration in big scholarly data. However, existing academic team definitions are commonly not quantitative, which makes it difficult to identify real academic teams. In this work, we propose a collaboration relationship evaluation index called Collaboration Intensity Index (CII), which is a two-way and quantitative index to evaluate collaboration intensity between two scholars in the network. Then, we construct a new type of co-author network with edges weighted by CII, which differs from the original co-author networks. This network reflects the newly scientific research patterns inside or outside academic teams. Furthermore, we propose TRAC (Team Recognition Algorithm based on CII) to identify academic teams from large co-author networks.

OERs are actual resources/tools that can help enrich any classroom environment and push student thinking and comprehension. One of the fundamental concepts of OER is ""the ability to freely adapt and reuse existing pieces of knowledge"", and therefore be a way to create more economic and personalized learning. The OER movement has challenged the traditional value chain by employing new methods to deliver high-quality educational content. The purpose of this work is to show a way to enhance the face-to-face classrooms with integration of OERs, and thus create blended learning instruction. Reuse of OERs by both individuals and organizations may have significant creative and economic benefit for learning environments. The approach is based on Linked Data for describe and publish OER.

This is because, due to the scalability restriction, most existing RL-based methods focus on the optimization of individual intersections while the impact of their cooperation is neglected. Without taking all the correlated intersections as a whole into account, it is difficult to achieve global optimization goals for complex traffic scenarios. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel federated reinforcement learning approach named FedLight to enable optimal signal control policy generation for multi-intersection traffic scenarios. Inspired by federated learning, our approach supports knowledge sharing among RL agents, whose models are trained using decentralized traffic data at intersections. Based on such model-level collaborations, both the overall convergence rate and control quality can be significantly improved. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that compared with the state-of-the-art techniques, our approach can not only achieve better average vehicle travel time for various multi-intersection configurations, but also converge to optimal solutions much faster.","0738-100X","978-1-6654-3274-0","10.1109/DAC18074.2021.9586175","National Key Research and Development Program of China; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9586175","Federated Reinforcement Learning;Neural Network;Advantage Actor-Critic;Traffic Signal Control","Design automation;Scalability;Process control;Collaboration;Reinforcement learning;Traffic control;Collaborative work","","13","","16","IEEE","8 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The traditional syntactic-based recommender systems suffer from a number of shortcomings for the information available on the internet has been designed to be readable only by humans and computer systems can not effectively process nor interpret the data present in it. As one Semantic Web technology, Ontology facilitates the knowledge sharing, reuse, communication, collaboration and construction of knowledge rich and intensive systems. Adding semantically empowered techniques to recommender systems can significantly improve the overall quality of recommendations. In this paper, an ontology-based method for personalized recommendation of knowledge in the heterogeneous environment is presented, which provides users with an autonomous tool that is able to minimize repetitive and tedious retrieved information. It constructs a domain ontology by integrating multi-resource and heterogeneous data, generates a user's interest ontology by analyzing the user's demographic characteristics and personal preferences. Based on the matching results of the domain ontology, user's query requests and interest ontology, the recommender system can suggest the proper information to the user who is likely interested in the related topics. Finally, qualitative evaluation is carried out in order to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.","","978-1-4673-2795-4","10.1109/ICCI-CC.2012.6311204","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6311204","personalized recommendation;ontology;semantic query;recommender system","Ontologies;Recommender systems;Semantics;Collaboration;XML;Data models","","12","","25","IEEE","24 Sep 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This concept has been expanded from personal knowledge management (PKM) frameworks using agent mediation, where intelligent agents are assigned with tasks to assist their human counterparts. In recent studies, PKM processes are understood to be a series of getting knowledge, analysing/understanding knowledge, sharing/publishing knowledge and connecting to others for knowledge over the Internet and social network. The critical issue of this concept involves identifying and `locating' knowledge experts for further enlightenment of one's personal knowledge. Taking into considerations the advantages of social network and the similarities between PKM processes and Nonaka's SECI model, the emergence of social intelligence are investigated in this paper by analysing the responses from a questionnaire survey on PKM processes over the social network. This paper also discusses the limitations of this research vis-à-vis the current situation where e-mail is still seen as the only reliable way to manage personal knowledge. It then recommends future works in the realm of social intelligence, involving software agents.","","978-1-4577-0989-0","10.1109/ICIMU.2011.6122717","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6122717","social intelligence;software agent technology;social network;personal knowledge m anagement","Multimedia communication","","12","","25","IEEE","5 Jan 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Based on micro data we show that the importance of external knowledge is positively correlated with participation in standardization. This suggests that firms aim to access the knowledge of other companies and stakeholders in order to increase their own knowledge base. The analysis also shows that firms cooperating with different actors are more likely to join standardization. Due to the positive relationships with incoming knowledge spillovers and forms of cooperation, we conclude that standardization represents a specific form of collaborative knowledge-sharing and knowledge-creating strategy. In addition, we are able to show that absorptive capacity measured via companies' research intensity promotes the involvement in standardization.","","978-1-4673-2134-1","10.1109/ITMC.2012.6306399","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6306399","","Companies;Technological innovation;Standards organizations;Patents","","11","","59","IEEE","20 Sep 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We are already experiencing, for example, a world where Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) play a more and more crucial role. CPSs integrate computational, physical, and networking elements, they comprise a number of subsystems, or entities, that are connected and work together. The open and highly distributed nature of the resulting system gives rise to unanticipated runtime management issues such as the organization of subsystems and resource optimization. In this paper, we focus on the problem of knowledge sharing among cooperating entities of a highly distributed and self-adaptive CPS. Specifically, the research question we address is how to minimize the knowledge that needs to be shared among the entities of a CPS. If all entities share all their knowledge with each other, the performance, energy and memory consumption as well as privacy are unnecessarily negatively impacted. To reduce the amount of knowledge to share between CPS entities, we envision a role-based adaptive knowledge exchange technique working on partial runtime models, i.e., Models reflecting only part of the state of the CPS. Our approach supports two adaptation dimensions: the runtime type of knowledge and conditions over the knowledge. We illustrate the feasibility of our technique by discussing its realization based on two state-of-the-art approaches.","2157-2321","978-0-7695-5567-6","10.1109/SEAMS.2015.25","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7194658","Model synchronization;Models@run.time;Cyber-Physical Systems","Runtime;Adaptation models;Object oriented modeling;Cleaning;Collaboration;Robot kinematics","","11","","23","IEEE","20 Aug 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The objective of this research is to study knowledge creation and sharing practices in a number of distributed agile projects, map these practices to the knowledge management strategies and determine which strategies are most common, which are applied only locally and which are applied globally. This is done by conducting a series of semi-structured qualitative interviews over a period of time span during May, 2012-June, 2013.

The existing publication platforms have some severe drawbacks. First, instead of promoting widespread knowledge sharing, access to publications on the platforms owned by publishers is often on a fee basis. This drawback of pay wall prevents researchers from ""standing on the shoulders of giants"". Moreover, the peer review process on most all existing publication platforms (including both openaccess and publisher platforms) is prone to be ineffective, since there is no proper incentive to reviewers for performing high-qualified reviews. PubChain is an alternative platform to the existing publication venues aiming to address their drawbacks. No central third-party owns the contents (i.e., papers and reviews) of PubChain. Exploiting blockchain technology, we devise an elaborate incentive scheme on PubChain to incentivize key stakeholders (i.e., authors, readers and reviewers) to participate publication activities on PubChain in a substantive manner by earning credits and rewards through self-motivated interactions. We have performed simulations to investigate the robustness of our proposed incentive scheme against fraudulent publications and reviews.
