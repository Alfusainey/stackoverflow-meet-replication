"A Soft Systems Analysis of Social Cognition In Boundary-Spanning Innovation","S.

This paper presents a systemic analysis of social cognition, employing three levels of analysis: (i) socially-situated cognition, involving interpretive, ""framing"" processes; (ii) socially-shared cognition, required to achieve joint framing of an information system; and (iii) distributed cognition, which views collaborative cognition as a set of overlapping frames, mediated by conceptual boundary objects. This research framework is operationalized through the use of Soft Systems Methodology. Findings from a case study of a boundary-spanning design group are presented, to demonstrate interactions between different levels of knowledge-sharing, social interpretation and consensus-building.","1530-1605","0-7695-2268-8","10.1109/HICSS.2005.51","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1385242","","Cognition;Technological innovation;Information analysis;Information systems;Collaboration;Educational institutions;Information science;Psychology;Information management;Management information systems","","3","","23","IEEE","24 Jan 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper proposes a concept to automatically build simulations using ontologies and its preliminary results. The proposed approach seeks to save time and effort expended in recreating the information for different use cases that already exists elsewhere. The use case provides first indications that with an enhancement of a so-called Digital Reference with Semantic Web Technologies, modeling and simulation of semiconductor supply chains will not only become much faster but also require less modeling efforts because of the reusability property.","1558-4305","978-1-7281-9499-8","10.1109/WSC48552.2020.9384102","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9384102","","Semiconductor device modeling;Semantic Web;Analytical models;Supply chains;Semantics;Ontologies;Tools","","3","","25","IEEE","29 Mar 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, a few months after introduction, the system was hardly being used at all. The analysis of the case suggests that non-use of a system can be understood in terms of dissonance, a dominant theme observed in the social dynamics of the implementation. Dissonance was observed through disparate mental models of a system's intention and use, disparate mental models of knowledge and knowledge ownership, and relational power dissonance where the spirit of knowledge sharing imbued in the mission of the system challenges the relational power position between the affected stakeholder groups. Understanding the implications of these issues can be used to inform a requirements engineering process for these kinds of software applications.","1530-1605","0-7695-2268-8","10.1109/HICSS.2005.613","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1385317","","Computer aided software engineering;Knowledge management;Insurance;Process design;Computer science;Cognitive science;Application software;Electric breakdown;Software systems;Cognition","","3","","34","IEEE","24 Jan 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we propose an AI-based educational chatbot paradigm that introduces context recognition, learning experience, and emotion management to improve learners’ emotional confidence through the dialogue template while strengthening the chatbots’ ability to guide materials to inspire learners. We utilize long-term attention mechanisms to establish emotional connections with learners and strengthen skill learners’ self-efficacy. We investigate two types of up-to-date AI chatbots and conduct a mathematical analysis of the learners’ dialogue trust and self-efficacy by DNN (deep learning neural network).

In this paper, evidence from case studies of realworld industrial creative processes is presented. Drawing on the evidence, the creativity, knowledge and IS literatures are critically examined. In particular, attention is given to the Creativity Templates approach - according to which, fundamental ""templates"" representing creativity regularities underlie seemingly original product instantiations, and therefore algorithms for the development of creative products can be used to enhance creative processes. An alternative view of bounded creativity is explored that is reliant on flexible knowledge sharing, rather than on prescriptive creativity algorithms. This view involves primarily two complementary organizational practices: communication of exemplars and references, and knowledge restriction. Ideation, in this view, takes place with no direct use of techniques or creativity enhancement methods. Such approach may be more suitable to highly creative organizations given the strong sense of identity and high regard of originality. Unlike many of the creativity support approaches presented in the literature, it is not an isolated technique but rather a set of fairly specific organizational practices, which, brought together, seem to give rise to creativity, and mitigate against potential identity conflicts.","1530-1605","0-7695-2268-8","10.1109/HICSS.2005.176","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1385323","","Knowledge management;Management information systems;Industrial relations;Identity management systems;Technology management;Isolation technology;Product development","","3","","65","IEEE","24 Jan 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Tapping into Latour's (1993) epistemological insights of mutual transformation, hybridization and inter- reciprocal relationship between the object and subject, it is proposed that effective boundary objects are in a constant flux of actual (and potential) co-construction and re-construction at the hands of interacting actors. This boundary constructing, in turn, leads to enriched organizational sense-making. Effective sharing of knowledge occurs as a result of boundary construction/actor interactions that are enabled within a shared context (ba) where mutual trust and respect, empathy and openness to others' differences, and requisite variety predominate. Such an environment is consistent with Enriquez's (1992) concept of differentiated work group environments, whereby emancipation of the self co-exists with identification to the other.","1530-1605","978-0-7695-3075-8","10.1109/HICSS.2008.493","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4439044","","Knowledge management;Conference management;Technology management;Aircraft propulsion;Manufacturing;Information technology;Project management;Databases;Design engineering;Engineering drawings","","3","","38","IEEE","22 Jan 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We use two approaches: The first one consists of making the system retrieve one or several requests similar to the seeking-learner's request using a textual case-based reasoning technique. The second approach aims at locating experts in specific areas in order to recommend them to the users who request this expertise. For this purpose, we use a hybrid recommendation technique based on Collaborative Filtering (CF) and Case-Based Reasoning (CBR). In contrast to existing approaches in expertise location, we believe that CBR combined to CF enables HELP to better recommend expertise, taking into account the user's feedback concerning the technical and pedagogical skills of the experts.","2161-5330","1-4244-1030-4","10.1109/AICCSA.2007.370734","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4231062","","Recommender systems;Java;Databases;Computer languages;Collaboration;Filtering;Feedback;Knowledge management;Information retrieval;Collaborative work","","3","","32","IEEE","11 Jun 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Informants suggested that the extent to which the client and vendor understand each others' expectations is crucial to using ITIL effectively, as are knowledge sharing and other aspects of good communication. This is also consistent with a further study of 83 ITIL users' experience. However, informants observed that it can take time before ITIL processes are fully understood and incorporated into practice.

Yet many KR initiatives fail to meet expectations, in part because knowledge workers underutilize the KR as a knowledge source. To date, little empirical research has considered how enabling characteristics of a KR influence individuals' propensity to use it as a knowledge source. This paper draws on extant knowledge management literature, including research on knowledge-based system design, to develop hypotheses relating key KR characteristics to KR knowledge sourcing behavior. These hypotheses are tested using survey data from 110 technical support agents from seven companies. Results reveal that support for online action (finding knowledge in the KR), support for offline action (applying retrieved knowledge to problem solving) and support for knowledge sharing are characteristics of a KR that predict its use as a knowledge source. Moreover, two of these relationships are moderated by the degree to which the knowledge worker retains autonomy in determining her work procedures. Implications for research and practice are discussed.","1530-1605","978-1-4244-5510-2","10.1109/HICSS.2010.249","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5428507","","Hardware;Knowledge management;Investments;Best practices;Documentation;Availability;Knowledge based systems;Testing;Problem-solving;Information technology","","3","","53","IEEE","11 Mar 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Hallmark cyber-physical incidents with disruptive and destructive capabilities like Stuxnet (2010) and Triton (2017) have exploited known vulnerabilities in information technology (IT) and operational technology (OT) assets throughout the attack lifecycle. However, the global critical infrastructure security community is still nascent in the field of industrial control systems (ICS) vulnerability management, especially in information-sharing. While their counterparts in IT security have spent years elaborating multiple resources to track and disseminate information about known vulnerabilities, the ICS community lacks specialized mechanisms for knowledge-sharing. Multiple challenges exist when addressing this issue: a general lack of awareness about ICS cybersecurity, the need to consider multiple industry sectors and unique network architectures, and the need to find a balance between protecting and releasing sensitive information regarding critical infrastructure organizations or proprietary vendor knowledge. Through a multiphase research initiative based on the user-centered design process, we intend to test and evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of various information-sharing platform designs for streamlining the discussion of ICS vulnerabilities. In the first phase of this research, we surveyed ICS and critical infrastructure security stakeholders to gain insight into the range of cogent, shared, and divergent views of the community relating to the need for specialized resources to share information about ICS vulnerabilities. We then evaluated what these different perspectives imply for the adoption and success of certain information-sharing platform frameworks. Finally, utilizing these insights, we demonstrated possible alternative paths forward for addressing the challenge of sharing information about ICS vulnerabilities to keep critical infrastructure safe.","2325-5374","978-9949-9904-5-0","10.23919/CYCON.2019.8756895","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8756895","Vulnerability management;critical infrastructure;industrial control systems (ICS);norms and standards;cyber-physical;information-sharing","Integrated circuits;Critical infrastructure;Organizations;Computer security;Standards organizations;Industrial control","","3","","39","","11 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Some service platform solutions are developed as cloud applications or make use of the benefits which the cloud computing paradigm offers. However, appropriate or detailed analyses of such platforms against cloud computing characteristics have not been found in the literature. Such analyses are of importance for the design and development process of future service solutions as they point out critical aspects that have to be appropriately addressed, assessed and incorporated into a solution's architecture to actually benefit from cloud computing. We close this gap by contributing an analysis of our developed mobility service ecosystem, consisting of service marketplaces and an ecosystem manager in terms of cloud computing characteristics. We analyze the operational behavior of the mobility service ecosystem and its components and assign respective cloud computing patterns to make concepts and requirements explicit. This analysis supports architects of future mobility solutions to understand the operational obstacles of such an ecosystem, outlines critical requirements of each component and provides a common terminology that utilized information transparency and knowledge sharing. Thus, service provisioning solutions can improve their performance and quality when they consider cloud computing pattern in their design.","","978-1-4673-9023-1","10.1109/RNDM.2016.7608301","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7608301","Smart City;Smart Mobility;Cloud Computing Patterns;Design Analysis;Interconnected Service Solutions","Cloud computing;Ecosystems;Business;Computational modeling;Smart cities","","3","","15","IEEE","27 Oct 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We first identify a set of 19 influential factors on the implementation of GSCM practices. Then, we build a model that exhibits and structures the influence relationships between these factors, using the Interpretative Structural Modeling (ISM) method and the MICMAC analysis. The results of our study show that some organizational and inter-organizational factors have particularly high driving power and influence potential on the other factors that affect the implementation of GSCM practices by a company.

A novel extraction-mapping algorithm is designed that accurately extracts, summarizes, and maps free text and content to concise structured medical concepts. Multiple concepts are mapped, including patient diagnoses, laboratory results, medications, and procedures, which allow shared characterization and hierarchical comparison. In addition, clinical and decision processes are established. These integrated data can be accessed through a secure web-based portal. A classification machine learning model (DAMIP) is then leveraged to establish predictive rules by uncovering relatively small subsets of discriminatory features that can predict the quality of treatment outcomes. We demonstrate system usability by analyzing treatment outcome for cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, hypertension, and chronic kidney disease. DAMIP yields good blind prediction accuracies of 89% – 97%. Moreover, for each disease the best practice was only used at fewer than 5% of the clinical sites, offering an excellent opportunity for knowledge sharing and rapid learning. Our findings also led to implementation of a new treatment policy for chronic kidney disease management. This resulting policy offers a better outcome for patients, saves lives, improves the quality of life for patients, and reduces 35% of treatment costs. Thus, this work has critical health practice implications. Through data-driven interoperability and predictive analytics, we have established and identified practice characteristics that result in good outcomes.

This paper illustrates the significance and functionality of KM for sustainable environmental integration from two aspects: maintaining structural knowledge and accessing and integrating external customer knowledge sources. The first aspect in regards to innovations or new markets is with direct impact on organizational knowledge. This produces knowledge gaps, which have to be filled by making available qualifiable operational performance indicators on the strategic layer as decision support component. The pragmatic approach behind this way of proceeding is the determination of decision goals for the initiatives, which leads to measurable alterations.

Hackathon itself is an intensive project-based event, requiring participants to make results in a short timeframe, which stimulates creative thinking, knowledge sharing, and overall learning. This has made hackathons popular in an educational context. As a hackathon event often implies software design, the introduction of hackathon practices would be especially beneficial for Software Engineering education. The question is how to attract a diverse student audience to enroll in these hackathon events and hackathon enhanced courses. Historically, hackathons attract fewer females than males and show gender balance issues. Even though there are positive examples of female-inclusive events, there is a risk that by focusing on women’s interests, the hackathon designers could end up discouraging the male audience. It was found that men e.g., tend to reject feminine products and occupations as they experience social pressure regarding what is acceptable for them. Thus, it would be reasonable to focus on the hackathon’s gender-neutrality rather than on female inclusivity. This research provides practices to implement hackathon courses gender-neutrally.

However, implementing FL for UAV networks introduces drawbacks such as communication overhead, synchronization issues, scalability limitations, and resource constraints. To address these challenges, this paper presents the Blockchain-enabled Clustered and Scalable Federated Learning (BCS-FL) framework for UAV networks. This improves the decentralization, coordination, scalability, and efficiency of FL in large-scale UAV networks. The framework partitions UAV networks into separate clusters, coordinated by cluster head UAVs (CHs), to establish a connected graph. Clustering enables efficient coordination of updates to the ML model. Additionally, hybrid inter-cluster and intra-cluster model aggregation schemes generate the global model after each training round, improving collaboration and knowledge sharing among clusters. The numerical findings illustrate the achievement of convergence while also emphasizing the trade-offs between the effectiveness of training and communication efficiency.","2378-4873","979-8-3503-0349-0","10.1109/CAMAD59638.2023.10478423","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10478423","Unmanned aerial vehicles;blockchain;scalable federated learning;clustering;data privacy","Training;Privacy;Federated learning;Scalability;Computational modeling;Collaboration;Autonomous aerial vehicles","","2","","13","IEEE","27 Mar 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Integrating Information, Communication, and Technology (ICT) with improved traditional teaching pedagogies can be one of the main elements in transforming the country's future development. Innovative practices in pedagogy have by and large crept into the domain of higher education in India in the last 30 years. But these innovations need to be improved and developed further considering the overall development of the students. We identified “Microteaching” to be a potential teaching strategy for blended and/or complete on-line teaching. In this paper, we identified few more teaching pedagogies - brainstorming, knowledge sharing, interactive case study, mnemonics, field trip, role-play & practical group activities, field trip, peer review of teaching and learning, data-driven approach, problem-driven approach and technology-driven approach that could fit within microteaching and we coined the term as “Extended Microteaching (XMT)”. We conducted a pilot study to determine the improvement that will be achieved by applying extended microteaching pedagogies in teaching and learning in Indian engineering colleges. From the results, we understand, in the new normal all the institutions will have blended or purely on-line teaching, that might start adopting our proposed teaching pedagogies, and many more pioneering practices will be implemented to improve the education system in India.","","978-1-6654-1550-7","10.1109/econf51404.2020.9385466","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9385466","e-learning;virtual learning;digital learning;teaching pedagogy;microteaching;teaching;learning;new normal;ICT;UTAUT;HEI","Technological innovation;Electronic learning;Education;Transforms;Information and communication technology","","2","","23","IEEE","1 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We propose a novel framework to address the issues of privacy and trust in collaborative industrial environments.

Although the deployment of machine learning in hotspot detection is found to save significant simulation time, such methods typically demand non-trivial quality data to build the model. While most design houses are actually short of quality data, they are also unwilling to directly share such layout related data to build a unified model due to the concerns on IP protection and model effectiveness. On the other hand, with data homogeneity and insufficiency within each design house, the locally trained models can be easily over-fitted, losing generalization ability and robustness when applying to the new designs. In this paper, we propose a heterogeneous federated learning framework for lithography hotspot detection that can address the aforementioned issues. The framework can build a more robust centralized global sub-model through heterogeneous knowledge sharing while keeping local data private. Then the global sub-model can be combined with a local submodel to better adapt to local data heterogeneity. The experimental results show that the proposed framework can overcome the challenge of non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data and heterogeneous communication to achieve very high performance in comparison to other state-of-the-art methods while guaranteeing good convergence in various scenarios.","2153-697X","978-1-6654-2135-5","10.1109/ASP-DAC52403.2022.9712491","National Key R&D Program of China(grant numbers:2018YFE0126300); NSFC(grant numbers:62034007); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:2020QNA5014); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9712491","","Lithography;Layout;Machine learning;Collaborative work;Feature extraction;Data models;Robustness","","2","","17","IEEE","21 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, due to the limited capacity of vehicles and the limited scenarios involved, the reliability and environmental adaptability of the current single-vehicle intelligence still need to be improved. In addition, driving knowledge only exists locally in each connected autonomous vehicle (CAV) and cannot be effectively reused or shared with other CAVs. To solve the above problems, this paper proposes to use federated learning (FL) to realize the collaboration of CAVs without revealing local data, thereby improving the accuracy of CAVs decision-making and driving safety. First, for the typical rear-end collision scenario, we propose a local decision-making model that comprehensively considers multiple influencing factors to fit the actual traffic environment. Then, we design a federated learning process for knowledge sharing. In particular, we propose a model similarity method to select high-quality local models for upload, thereby reducing communication overhead while improving the accuracy of the global model.

Using data from 213 Chinese firms, it is found that organizational memory, knowledge sharing, knowledge absorption, and knowledge receptivity serve as first-order indicators of the higher-order construct we label knowledge management orientation, which, in turn, has a positive link with market orientation. Importantly, the research found that market orientation mediates the relationship between knowledge management orientation on one hand and subjective and objective firm performance on the other.

These theories inform the production of structural representations of sensorimotor processes, and these representations, in turn, permit perceptual fusion to broaden categories of activity. Although the specific knowledge required by a robot will depend on the particular application domain, there is a need for fundamental mechanisms which allow each individual robot to obtain the requisite knowledge. Current methods are too brittle and do not scale very well, and a new approach to perceptual knowledge representation is necessary. Our approach provides firm semantic grounding in the real world, provides for robust dynamic performance in real-time environments with a range of sensors and allows for communication of acquired knowledge in a broad community of other robots and agents, including humans. Our work focuses on symmetry based multisensor knowledge structuring in terms of: (1) symmetry detection in signals, and (2) symmetry parsing for knowledge structure, including structural bootstrapping and knowledge sharing. Operationally, the hypothesis is that group theoretic representations (G-Reps) inform cognitive activity. Our contributions here are to demonstrate symmetry detection and signal analysis and for 1D and 2D signals in a simple office environment; symmetry parsing based on these tokens is left for future work.","","978-1-4673-2512-7","10.1109/MFI.2012.6343065","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6343065","","Robot sensing systems;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Actuators;Indexes;Robustness","","2","","28","IEEE","10 Nov 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

People across the globe express their views on products & services, predict share price and present feedback on the policies of the regimes. Everything that is shared on social networks may not be authentic or denote the truth. However, it definitely forms a basis to investigate and comprehend the public sentiments. Public sentiments are capable of affecting the economic landscape via foreign investments and stock markets among having other financial and social impacts. In this paper, we have analyzed public sentiments on the Goods and Services tax, popularly known as GST in India. GST subsumes eight central and nine state taxes thereby integrating the absolute indirect tax framework in the country which paves the way for varied opinions & reactions imperative to analyze a collective sentiment. We used a hybrid approach to do the sentiment analysis which uses a combination of lexicon-based method and supervised machine learning approach to determine public sentiments. We accumulated 163,373 tweets over a span of three weeks from July 4th to 25th, 2017 after GST was implemented in India w.e.f. July 1st, 2017. A spatio-temporal analysis was performed on the collected tweets. In this research, we annotated 22,000 unique tweets with the help of a lexicon-based method and thenceforth applied supervised machine learning techniques with a set of six distinct algorithms to train and predict the polarity on the complete data set. K-fold cross validation technique, for K in range of 3-10, was used to assess the model for an independent data set. Subsequently, it was found that accuracy, precision, recall and F1 score of all the models provided the best results when K approached 10. Resultantly, we observed that SVM and Logistic Regression could predict the polarity of new incoming tweets with an accuracy of 77.6% and 79.31% respectively.","","978-1-7281-6823-4","10.1109/WorldS450073.2020.9210400","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9210400","Sentiment Analysis;Hybrid Approach;Supervised Machine Learning;Lexicon;Spatial Analysis;Temporal Analysis;GST","Sentiment analysis;Machine learning;Support vector machines;Finance;Prediction algorithms;Twitter","","2","","29","IEEE","1 Oct 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The 2014-2017 Kenya's Council of Governors strategic plan postulated enactment of a knowledge management strategy where good practices and lessons learnt within any county government should be documented and disseminated in appropriate forums to other counties. However, the 2017-2022 strategic plan indicates that there is lack of a structured mechanism for systematic knowledge sharing and organizational learning among the county governments despite the council's effort to share information through statutory annual reports, devolution conferences and quarterly sectoral committee meetings. But, the 2017-2022 strategic plan envisions a systematic mechanism for sharing experiences among the county governments. The intention of this study was to assess the current knowledge management practices among the county governments in Kenya; to identify, and articulate knowledge management concepts that are useful to the public services sector among devolved governments in developing countries; and to model these practices into a framework that can support continuous sharing of experiences, lessons and innovations within and among the county governments in Kenya. Theoretical frameworks and models of knowledge management in governance, governments and e-governments were considered and a conceptual framework for successful knowledge management initiatives among county and regional governments was formulated. The proposed conceptual framework was evaluated using a focus group discussion with participants drawn from the Council of Governors' Maarifa Center employees. The study proposes a framework to facilitate effective sharing of experiences among county employees, between different county governments and to manage and enhance knowledge management initiatives among the devolved governments.

Much security information is widely available in books, open literature or on the internet. We argue that the generated huge mass of information has resulted in a form of information overload to software engineers who usually finish reading it without being able to apply those principles clearly to their own application context. Our research tackles software security issues from a knowledge management perspective. In this paper, we present an ontology approach to model the knowledge of software security in a context-sensitive manner, supporting software engineers and learners to enable the correlation process between security domain knowledge and their working context. We also propose a web-based application for security knowledge sharing and learning where the ontology is adopted as the central knowledge repository.","2305-7254","978-9-5268-6536-2","10.23919/FRUCT.2018.8588107","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8588107","","Security;Software;Ontologies;Context modeling;Knowledge management;Semantics","","2","","47","","27 Dec 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Though widely used for tasks such as computer vision, the application of transfer learning to time-series classification problems (e.g., classification of light curves) is underexplored. The proposed framework makes several important contributions to facilitate knowledge sharing, while simultaneously ensuring an effective solution for domain specific fine-level categorizations. First, in contrast to the traditional approaches, the proposed framework describes pairwise view similarity by identifying a smaller subset of source-view samples that closely resemble the target data patterns. Second, by means of two-phase learning, a generic baseline model is learned on a larger source data collection and later fine-tuned on a smaller target data collection, precisely approximating the target data patterns. Third, an effective view-adaptive timestamp weighting scheme evaluates the relative importance of each timestamp in a more data-driven manner, which enables a more flexible yet discriminative feature representation scheme in the presence of evolving data characteristics. As shown by experiments, compared to the existing approaches, our proposed deep transfer learning framework improves classification performance by around 2-3% in the UCI multi-view activity recognition dataset, while also showing a robust, generalized representation capacity in classifying several large-scale multi-view light curve collections.","0730-3157","978-1-7281-2607-4","10.1109/COMPSAC.2019.00061","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8753914","LSTM;RNN;Mult-iview Classification;Transfer Learning;Distributed Time-Series Analysi;Deep Learning;Minimum Description Length","Data models;Task analysis;Data collection;Deep learning;Distributed databases;Feature extraction;Predictive models","","2","","40","IEEE","9 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Our results indicate that characteristics that separate service innovations from product or process innovations may notably influence efficacy of protection. Furthermore, as creation of service innovations often includes collaborative activities, there is yet another twist to protection issues: On the one hand, companies should protect their knowledge in order to secure their positions.

To alleviate the above issue, a zoning search and transfer learning- based multimodal multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (called ZSTL-MMOEA) is proposed in the present study. In the ZSTL-MMOEA, the decision space is divided into many subspaces and the transfer learning is used to realize knowledge sharing between two the most similar subspaces. The ZSTL-MMOEA is compared with five recently proposed multimodal multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MMOE- As) on 22 test functions.

In a highly competitive world, it is imperative for different manufacturing systems to have interoperability in order to aid better, faster and cheaper production. However, different manufacturing domains have different data structures, syntaxes and semantics which lead to problems in interoperability and knowledge sharing. Interoperability issues can potentially be resolved if a computationally interpretable ontology can provide a basis for common understanding across different manufacturing domains. Although researchers have proposed manufacturing ontologies, the number of manufacturing domains addressed and the formalization have been limited. Research work is required to develop a formal core manufacturing ontology that supports various product lifecycle domains. This paper proposes a formal Product Lifecycle Ontology (PLO) to facilitate interoperability across multiple product lifecycle domains. The proposed ontology is semantically enriched comprising of core concepts, relations and axioms. The ontology is aimed at supporting interoperability not only across different manufacturing domains but also across different time frames. The proposed ontology contributes towards a reference manufacturing ontology that expands previous works and fills in the research gaps that exist within the area of formal manufacturing reference ontologies.","","978-1-5090-4284-5","10.1109/ICSC.2017.44","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7889567","ontology;product lifecycle;manufacturing semantics;interoperability","Ontologies;Manufacturing;Interoperability;Semantics;Unified modeling language;Inspection;Machining","","2","","36","IEEE","30 Mar 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Basically every researcher in educational context suffer from lack of internal or furthermore cross institute collaboration, which supports research in the best way and prevent from unnecessary efforts in the initial and latter steps of a research project. Web 2.0 has the potential to cover the lack of research collaboration with tools that includes collaboration, knowledge sharing and consequently collaborative learning. This paper reviews some frameworks of eLearning and introduces a new functional framework that aims to facilitate eLearning with research support embedded functionality. A case study has been conducted to analyze the current state of a university eLearning system and the framework potentials to improve that as an educational context. To evaluate the framework effectiveness a quantitative analysis has been conducted as well.","","978-1-4673-0654-6","10.1109/ICIMTR.2012.6236467","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6236467","collaborative learning;eLearning;knowledge sharing;university;web 2.0","Electronic learning;Collaboration;Knowledge engineering;Internet;Collaborative work;Communities;Information services","","2","","21","IEEE","12 Jul 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

New media such as Facebook and G+ have such elements that motivate team members, especially young developers, to remain online facilitating the communication just in time. In this paper we present some experiences using the most popular social media such as Facebook, G+, Skype, and Dropbox in developing software projects.

Aiming at the diversity of design knowledge, this paper proposes an ontology-based model to reach at an unambiguous and normative representation of the knowledge. Firstly, an ontology-based human-machine integrated design framework is described, then corresponding ontologies and sub-ontologies are established according to different purposes and scopes. Secondly, a similarity calculation-based ontology integration method composed of ontology mapping and ontology merging is introduced. The ontology searching-based knowledge sharing method is then developed. Finally, a case of human-machine integrated design of a large ultra-precision grinding machine is used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the method.","","978-1-4799-5554-1","10.1109/ES.2014.19","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6997022","knowledge management;ontology;human-machine integrated design","Ontologies;Man machine systems;Grinding machines;Merging;Optimization;Semantics;Thermal stability","","2","","18","IEEE","19 Jan 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Typically, IORs are measured by high-level key performance indicators (KPIs) such as trust, knowledge sharing, and others. However, these high-level KPIs are difficult to be measured quantitatively. It is therefore difficult to determine IORs and their outcomes since the evaluation of IORs results in a complex and ambiguous task. In this vision paper, we propose a set of research questions dealing with measuring and evaluating IORs. Based on these research questions, we define a conceptual framework including (i) the identification of KPIs from inter-organizational processes in combination with business information derived from EDIFACT messages and (ii) the alignment of KPIs to business goals by means of the Balanced Scorecard methodology and semantic technology. Having the approach at hand supports us in lifting operational information to the business level. The alignment between KPIs and business goals allows evaluating an organizations' IORs and results in two distinct advantages. First, the explicit connection between KPIs and business goals results in a justification of the relation between IORs and business achievements. Second, the evaluation of IORs against strategic goals can be achieved semi-automatically.","","978-953-233-068-7","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6240905","","Ontologies;Semantics;Data mining;Organizations;Performance analysis;Context","","2","","21","","16 Jul 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The main actor is the database administrator (DBA) who interacts with other DBAs and with other actors. Thus, sharing knowledge among them is crucial. This knowledge relies on each member's skills, experiences and background, and also on the common activities, conditions, facts, and situations faced during the administration of the database and the setting of the environment. Exchanging knowledge between the DBA and the other actors can only be effective if there is a common interpretive focus and a shared context where they can understand each other and exchange their experiences. The concept of context plays an important role in collaboration, especially in communication, interaction and knowledge sharing. In addition, and under temporal and financial pressures, this can help a DBA in avoiding misunderstandings and accidents such as destroying each other's work or imposed system downtime. The paper presents how collaboration improves the contextualization of DBA procedures and the development of the DBA practices. Our work focuses on collaboration between actors with different roles according to an internal observation that is to say from the point of view of the main actor (i.e. DBA) to help him achieve his objective. This is a key element in the building of a support system for DBA acting as a real context-based intelligent assistant system based on a collaborative work.

Internet is widely used for knowledge sharing, online review of products etc. Many open forums, blogs are used for this purpose. Since many users are contributing their opinions towards any query submitted by information seeker, there is a possibility of confusion. Often opinions contradict with each other creating confusion in information seeker's mind. In these cases role of Opinion Leader(s) is very prominent. Opinion Leader is a person who has knowledge in the particular field, who's opinion makes difference and who can influence other's opinions. Identification of a person who has great experiences and/or knowledge, in a particular domain, is very helpful and useful in decision making, product marketing etc. This paper presents an approach for identification of Opinion Leader(s) using modified SPEAR (Spamming Resistant Expertise Analysis and Ranking) algorithm. The expertise of user is found out on different topics. Modified SPEAR algorithm effectively identifies Opinion Leader(s) by making use of additional influence measures in the form of credit score functions. It also analyses these measures and studies their effects while ranking the Opinion Leader(s) effectively.","","978-1-5090-1338-8","10.1109/CAST.2016.7914956","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7914956","HITS;SPEAR;Opinion Leader","Algorithm design and analysis;Web pages;Internet;Classification algorithms;Blogs;Facebook","","2","","18","IEEE","1 May 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We hypothesize that members' perceived distributive, interactional, and procedural justice are viable antecedents leading to the inducement of team goal commitment among virtual project team members. A longitudinal field experiment was carried out to test these hypotheses. The results suggest that: (1) distributive justice is a consistently strong predictor of team goal commitment over time; (2) the effect of interactional justice on team goal commitment manifests over time, and; (3) procedural justice has no effect on team goal commitment over time.

Recently, researchers have investigated a lot of state-of-the-art methods to improve the accuracy and efficiency of text detection and recognition. However, there has been little research on text detection and recognition in natural scenes in Vietnam. In this paper, a deep learning-based empirical investigation of Vietnamese scene text detection and recognition is presented. Firstly, four detection models including differentiable binarization network (DBN), pyramid mask text detector (PMTD), pixel aggregation network (PAN), and Fourier contour embedding network (FCEN), are employed to detect text regions from the images. Then, four text recognition models including convolutional recurrent neural network (CRNN), self-attention text recognition network (SATRN), no-recurrence sequence-to-sequence text recognizer (NRTR), and RobustScanner (RS) are also investigated to recognize the texts. Moreover, data augmentation methods are also applied to enrich data for improving the accuracy and enhancing the performance of scene text detection and recognition. To validate the effectiveness of scene text detection and recognition models, the VinText dataset is employed for evaluation. Empirical results show that PMTD and SATRN achieve the highest scores among the others for text detection and recognition, respectively.

However, group work can often emphasise product, rather than the processes that lead to the production of an artifact. Furthermore, co-writing activities also cause problems with the clear identification of group member contributions and the assessment of educational objectives. Wikis are implemented in the anticipation that students are applying knowledge, sharing, and engaging in cognitive and metacognitive processes as a group, however, exactly which cognitive and metacognitive processes occur behind the 'edits' of the wiki? This paper examines students' ""invisible"" behaviours as they co-construct a wiki response to a problem-based learning question. Our analysis confirms the complex nature of assessing ""process"" behaviours. The discussion space proved to be a valuable tool for students in the consultation and production of the wiki response and a number of cognitive and metacognitive behaviours emerged in the discussions.","","978-0-7695-4960-6","10.1109/LaTiCE.2013.22","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6542253","problem-based learning;computer-supported collaborative learning;computer science education;metacognition","Internet;Electronic publishing;Encyclopedias;Collaboration;Monitoring;Cognition","","2","","41","IEEE","20 Jun 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Therefore, the growing need to train students in team collaboration skills propelled educators in computer science and engineering to adopt team-based pedagogical strategies. Team-based pedagogy has shown success in enhancing students' knowledge in course subjects and their motivation in learning. However, it is limited in offering concrete frameworks specifically focusing on how to teach team collaboration skills. As part of an interdisciplinary effort, we draw on Transactive Memory Systems Theory-a communication theory that explains how individuals in groups learn who knows what and organize who does what-in developing a Team Knowledge Sharing Assignment as a tool for student teams to structure their team collaboration processes. This paper reports a result of a case study in designing and facilitating the assignment for cybersecurity students enrolled in a scholarship program. Students' evaluations and the instructor's assessment reveal that the assignment made a positive impact on students' team collaboration skills by helping them successfully identify their team members' expertise and capitalize on their team's knowledge resources when delegating functional roles. Based on this case study, we offer practical suggestions on how the assignment could be used for various classes or cybersecurity projects and how instructors could maximize its benefits.","2165-9567","978-1-7281-8478-4","10.1109/EDUCON46332.2021.9453894","National Science Foundation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9453894","Team Collaboration;Transactive Memory;Knowledge Sharing;Cybersecurity;Computer Science Education;Engineering Education","Computer science;Scholarships;Conferences;Collaboration;Focusing;Tools;Propulsion","","2","","16","IEEE","18 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the environment is increasingly becoming more complex and rapidly changing and the economy have already transformed in some parts of the world to become knowledge based. Managers are therefore becoming increasingly aware of the need to manage their knowledge in a more structured way and of the need to think of ways to effectively and efficiently manage their knowledge to sustain the company's competitive advantage and survival. There is evidence that Knowledge Management (KM) can have a favorable impact on organizational performance, however, the factors need to be clearly defined, and correlations need to be measured exactly to make the maximum benefits of KM initiatives. The purpose of this research project is to assess the impact of KM on the business strategy and the overall organizational performance at different organizations in Sudan working on different industrial sectors. The research found that KM practices were used inside Sudanese organizations, however, that was done in unstructured way to get more benefit from it. Having those KM practices in house provides significant opportunities for improving those practices inside Sudanese organizations. Top management commitment, organizational culture and Human Resources Management (HRM) have been identified as the major influences on KM and its practices. The research highlighted the need for the recognition of employees' efforts in order to encourage learning and development of new ideas. It also highlighted the need for conscious efforts to manage Knowledge sharing and learning, inside Sudanese Organization. The oral culture of Sudanese people makes the face to face exchange of knowledge, the major methods of transferring information and knowledge inside Sudanese organizations. The research recommended that KM practices can be introduced inside organizations by making it part of the work processes, hence, guarantee its benefits and outcomes.","","978-1-5386-0667-4","10.1109/SCCSIT.2017.8293062","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8293062","Knowledge;Knowledge Management;Organizational Performance;Business Strategies;Impact","Companies;Standards organizations;Software;Banking;Knowledge management","","2","","15","IEEE","15 Feb 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In order to be sure that they understand each other, systems use concept learning to learn the meaning of concepts they communicate with. In this paper, we try to overcome this complexity by suggesting a system that enables agents to learn new concepts from several different agents at the same time and each agent has its own ontology.

Overall twenty-one participants were interviewed using a semi-structured interview script. The findings of the study show that it is tacit knowledge that is more difficult to share and that this type of knowledge is of a very different nature depending on the stages of design and development. The study showed that tacit knowledge in the SW process ranges from very soft skills of dealing, dialoguing and negotiating with users to the very technical aspects of programming. This clearly represents a serious challenge to professionals in this sector and requires inclusive KM and KS processes based on an in-depth understanding of both the process and tacit knowledge involved.

Much research has focused on coexistence cognitive networks- where secondary users are vying for spectral ""white space"" when primary users vacate a licensed frequency band. This work will instead focus on an ""open spectrum"" regime, where there are no primary or secondary users, but all are provided equal access to the available band. Many cognitive medium access control (MAC) layers have been proposed to regulate the use of spectrum in a spectrum sharing regime, but most require the use of a common control channel (CCC) for information exchange. Additionally, while there is much research focusing on the spectrum sensing problem (detecting the presence of unused bands), the problem of spectrum recognition (determining the band of a signal of interest) has not received as much attention. We propose a new modulation scheme, frequency envelope modulation (FEM), that enables the creation of an open, cognitive ad hoc network. This network uses distributed spectrum sensing and information sharing to dispense with the need for a CCC. The effect of FEM on the physical layer is analyzed, as well as the network configuration time using FEM. We show that knowledge sharing via FEM reduces configuration time exponentially compared to uncoordinated scanning.","","978-1-4673-9526-7","10.1109/GLOCOMW.2015.7414052","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7414052","","Finite element analysis;Time-domain analysis;Sensors;Frequency modulation;Media Access Protocol;Frequency-domain analysis","","2","","20","IEEE","25 Feb 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
