We called it application-specific ontology, for specific software development. It enables remote team members browsing, searching, sharing, and authoring ontological data under the distributed software engineering projects environment. We transform explicit meaningful human knowledge into application-specific ontology, where knowledge structures and semantics are linked, and we go through a formal hand-shaking agreement establishing process before the semantic contents are updated in ontology repositories. The application-specific ontology is used for communication over project agreement to facilitate better, highly consistent communications and formalized domain knowledge sharing. We assume that object-oriented development is deployed in the distributed projects. The knowledge of object-oriented development formed in the application-specific ontology clarifies the objectoriented development concepts in a machine understandable form. Software agent, for example, can be utilised to extract information.","1550-6215","0-7695-2306-4","10.1109/SEW.2005.41","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1521191","","Software engineering;Programming;Ontologies;Communications technology;Vocabulary;Information systems;Information technology;Australia;Humans;Software agents","","7","","23","IEEE","27 Dec 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

First, our system can describe types, hierarchies, relations of contexts, so that any context instance can be accommodated into the system with no additional effort. Seconds, as we design two level's ontology, any system which uses ontology could reuse our context ontology context in pervasive environment.

In this paper, we first propose a formal context-model based on ontology using OWL to realize semantic context representation, context reasoning and knowledge sharing, context classification and so on. Our context model captures various contexts by introducing a classification scheme; captures relationships between different context information by introducing dependency tag to the property associated with a specified context class; captures quality of context by annotating sensed context with extensible quality constraints. It also supports the use of different context reasoning engines to reason about various contexts so that applications can be given a notion of the confidence of different contexts before acting on it. And then, based on the context model, an architecture for building of context-aware services is presented.","","0-7695-2731-0","10.1109/CIMCA.2006.181","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4052807","","Context modeling;Ontologies;Context-aware services;Context awareness;Pervasive computing;OWL;Mobile computing;Buildings;Middleware;Computational intelligence","","7","","12","IEEE","8 Jan 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This study examines whether pair programming is effective from cognitive load perspective in distributed situation. We compares the cognitive loads for the visual programming language, called Star Logo TNG, under three circumstances that is alone, pair programming, and distributed pair programming. The experimental results show that learners prefer traditional pair programming to alone. Moreover, the pair programming can reduce germane cognitive load significantly. However, there is no significant difference between the single and distributed pair programming. Meanwhile, there is no significant difference on learning performance between traditional and distributed pair programming.

Compared with the traditional optical image, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging has greater advantages, such as the ability to penetrate through fog and smoke. However, SAR images are of low resolution and contaminated by high-level speckle noise. As a result, it is of great difficulty to extract powerful and robust features from the SAR images. In this paper, we explored whether multiple imaging modalities can improve the object detection performance. Here, we propose a Cross Modality Knowledge Distillation (CMKD) paradigm, and explore two different network structures named CMKD-s and CMKD-m for the object classification task. Specifically, CMKD-s transfers the information captured by the two sensors using the online knowledge distillation, which can achieve cross-modal knowledge sharing and enhance the robustness of the aerial view object classification model. Moreover, leveraging the semi-supervised enhanced training, we proposed a novel method named CMKD-m, which strengthens the model for mutual knowledge transfer. Through quantitative comparison, we found that CMKD-s and CMKD-m outperform the method without knowledge transfer, on the NTIRE2021 SAR-EO challenge dataset.","2160-7516","978-1-6654-4899-4","10.1109/CVPRW53098.2021.00048","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9522712","","Training;Speckle;Feature extraction;Radar polarimetry;Data models;Robustness;Pattern recognition","","6","","18","IEEE","1 Sep 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Some of the hearing-impaired people use sign language to communicate with other similarly-affected individuals as well as with those with normal hearing ability. Sign language comprises a range of hand shapes, facial expressions, body movements, and lip patterns. Currently, one of the most urgent requirements of the hearing-impaired, especially the young among them is their education needs. They need to learn how to communicate and convey information as well as effectively share learning materials between them. Towards this end, the potential solution lies in the use of today's advanced modern global technology innovations, such as cloud based on e-learning systems. This system can be made accessible to instructors and students and prove to be a practical and effective pedagogical tool for the hearing-impaired and their instructors. This study aims to investigate the key factors that can positively impact teachers' motivation to adopt cloud based on e-learning systems for deaf students. A survey research design method was chosen to verify the factors and construct the relationship between them. The main factors that may affect teachers' motivation to adopt and use cloud based on the e-learning system and involve the following key factors: hardware availability, software modularity, cost, security and privacy, training, knowledge sharing, top management support, sign language, video and animation, online dictionary, teacher motivation, and system adoption. To verify the reliability of the questionnaire, a pilot study was done among 30 participants. The questionnaire was distributed among teachers of deaf students in Baghdad deaf institutes to examine the hypothesis on each factor.

Ant colony optimization (ACO) is a meta-heuristic method based on the behaviors of artificial ants with collaboration and knowledge-sharing mechanism during their food-seeking process. ACO algorithm has been applied to traffic signal optimization in literature; however, current studies often focus on the development of two-phase controllers which is less computationally complex. In this research, we extend the ACO-based approach for eight-phase dual-ring traffic control to reduce vehicle delay and queue length at intersections. Computer simulation results indicate the proposed approach is more efficient than the conventional fully actuated control method for heavy and unbalanced traffic demand.","","978-1-6654-6007-1","10.1109/ICITE56321.2022.10101431","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10101431","traffic signal timing;ant colony optimization;traffic intersection;swarm intelligence;dual-ring traffic signal control","Ant colony optimization;Computer simulation;Metaheuristics;Transportation;Collaboration;Traffic control;Delays","","5","","14","IEEE","18 Apr 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Drucker (1993) said that knowledge would be the only competitive resource for companies in the future. This is an era in which knowledge plays a dominant role in our daily business lives. Intellectual capital has gradually taken the place of traditional tangible capital in many business organizations. However, practitioners are often puzzled about where they stand, how well they are doing, and what they should do next. This paper aims to construct a knowledge management maturity model as a means to help answer these and related questions. There are three components in the proposed model: maturity levels, knowledge management processes, and knowledge management capabilities or enabling infrastructures. The maturity levels are based on the capability maturity model (CMM) of SEI. This model divides the knowledge management process into four main sub-processes: knowledge creation, knowledge storage, knowledge sharing, and knowledge application, emphasizing the need for continuous process improvement. Furthermore, knowledge management enablers are integrated into KMMM to describe how it supports the practices at each maturity level. The applicability of this model is evaluated through case studies, which also serve to illustrate how knowledge management practices among organizations are compared, and what maturity paths organizations can follow. Three banks were taken for cases study through in depth interview with their senior managements.

The agricultural sector is confronted with the major challenge of increasing agriculture production to feed a growing and increasingly prosperous population in a situation of decreasing availability of natural resources. Factors of particular concern are water shortages, declining soil fertility, effects of climate change and rapid decrease of fertile agricultural lands due to urbanisation. Information and communication technologies (ICTs) in agriculture have the potential to increase the efficiency, productivity and sustainability agriculture by providing information and knowledge sharing. In this paper, we seek to illustrate the contribution of ICT to food security and sustainability agriculture in developing countries. We argue that developing solution architecture (e-agriculture framework) to expose farmers to the much needed agricultural information (i.e., preharvest and post harvest information, pricing, weather conditions etc) can boost agricultural productivity. We show that such a framework must accommodate the dynamic trends in ICT tools, applications, adoption and usage. Further, we illustrate the development of such a framework to address these aforementioned properties to improve agricultural productivity.","","978-1-905824-38-0","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6701752","ICT;e-agriculture;model;solution architecture;framework","Agriculture;Productivity;Meteorology;Availability;Soil;Security","","4","","16","","9 Jan 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Using a social networking approach, the application enables smallholders to interact with traders, retailers, consumers, and each other in such a way as to encourage the emergence of sustainable and fair regional markets. It will increase profitability by providing information on price and demand, and enable better cooperation and knowledge-sharing between farmers. This may not only improve yields, but also increase diversity in agricultural products produced: farmers can better adapt to changing climatic conditions and be less vulnerable to volatile commodity prices.","","978-0-7695-4849-4","10.1109/GHTC.2012.37","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6387044","social networks;smartphones;rural empowerment","Agriculture;Meteorology;Smart phones;Mobile communication;Social network services;Africa","","4","","10","IEEE","31 Dec 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Digital forensics is categorized in Disk, Live, Network and Mobile Forensics. Anomaly or attack over the network comes under network forensic branch. In this paper extensive literature review is performed to compare the latest intrusion detection systems and based on the learning's a system is proposed which covers the peer to peer architecture system and utilization of web robots to trace the attack and log it in a form which will be a useful input for forensic investigation and analysis work.","","978-1-5386-8010-0","10.1109/ICACTM.2019.8776801","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8776801","Intrusion detection;Machine Learning;protocol analysis;network security;Anomaly Detection;social networks","Forensics;Intrusion detection;Social networking (online);Machine learning;Data mining;Communication system security","","4","","21","IEEE","29 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To tackle this problem, instead of traditional heuristics-based algorithms, more adaptive detection systems such as natural language processing (NLP)powered approaches are essential to understanding phishing text representations. Nevertheless, concerns surrounding the collection of phishing data that might cover confidential information hinder the effectiveness of model learning. We propose a decentralized phishing email detection framework called Federated Phish Bowl (FedPB) which facilitates collaborative phishing detection with privacy. In particular, we devise a knowledge-sharing mechanism with federated learning (FL). Using long short-term memory (LSTM) for phishing detection, the framework adapts by sharing a global word embedding matrix across the clients, with each client running its local model with Non-IID data. We collected the most recent phishing samples to study the effectiveness of the proposed method using different client numbers and data distributions. The results show that FedPB can attain a competitive performance with a centralized phishing detector, with generality to various cases of FL retaining a prediction accuracy of 83%.","2577-1655","978-1-6654-5258-8","10.1109/SMC53654.2022.9945584","United Nations; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9945584","data privacy;federated learning;long short-term memory;multi-party computation;phishing email detection","Adaptation models;Privacy;Phishing;Heuristic algorithms;Training data;Data models;Robustness","","4","","21","IEEE","18 Nov 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Robot perception is limited to sensor range and hence robots are only aware of the obstacles within the range of its sensor. Moreover, the knowledge of new obstacles observed by each robot is kept local to itself. Due to these limitations, robots are often unaware of the new obstacles or path blockages in remote sections of the map. We proposed a knowledge sharing architecture in which the robots share the knowledge of new obstacles and blocked paths with each other. This enables the robots to update their map with the new and remote obstacles, and plan efficient paths with the timely information. This eliminates the need for re-planning of paths in traditional navigation methods.

Methods like multitask learning, knowledge distillation and model adaptation, which overcome data sparsity and model over-fitting problems are employed to study the merits of each method. In Knowledge distillation framework, some privilege information in addition to featurelabels pairs available only during training, is exploited to help the model learn better without using such previleged information during testing [1]; knowledge from one model can be distilled to another and thereby guiding it in learning better [2]. In this work, a DNN acoustic model trained using data pooled from Dysarthric speech data and parallel un-impaired data is used as the intelligent teacher while the student DNN model is trained using only Dysarthric speech. The target label for training the student model is a combination of hard aligned labels and those obtained from forward-pass through the teacher model. In addition to this technique, other knowledge sharing techniques like multitask learning were explored for Dysarthric speech data and have found to show a relative improvement of 11% over the corresponding baseline models.","","978-1-5090-5356-8","10.1109/NCC.2017.8077102","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8077102","Dysarthria;speech recognition;deep neural networks;distillation;multitasking","Speech;Data models;Hidden Markov models;Adaptation models;Acoustics;Training;Speech recognition","","4","","16","IEEE","23 Oct 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We consider that the femtocells are intelligent devices implementing a learning process through which they make decisions without the guidance of a centralized entity. In distributed settings, however, the learning may be complex and slow due to coupled decision making processes resulting in non-stationarities. The docitive paradigm proposes a timely solution based on knowledge sharing, which allows femtocells to develop new capacities for selecting appropriate actions. We demonstrate that this improves the femtocells' learning ability and accuracy, and gives them strategies for action selection in unvis-ited states. We evaluate the docitive paradigms in the context of a 3GPP compliant OFDMA (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access) based femtocell network modeled as a multi-agent system, where the agents implement a real-time multi-agent reinforcement learning technique known as decentralized Q-learning. Our goal is to solve the well known coexistence problem between macro and femto systems by controlling the aggregated interference generated by multiple femtocells at the macrocell receiver.

The blended program consists of face-to-face workshops and pre-and post-workshop e-learning assignments. Those who meet the criteria and pass assignments are issued a digital badge as a certificate of completion. The peer learning design on the discussion forum in post-learning phases was supported by the four principles of knowledge sharing, adaptation to proficiency level, reflection as main topic, and group structure and engagement. The targets of this study were novices of the learning contents and were unfamiliar with online learning. Based on these conditions, the peer learning activity was rather simple, which was deemed suitable for this group. Based on participant reactions, it is suggested that the design strategy behind peer learning in this study encourages participants' mastery of content. Further, some participants reported positive reactions toward peer learning in the discussion forum of the LMS utilized in this program.","","978-1-7281-3388-1","10.1109/ISET.2019.00042","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8782234","peer learning, communities of practice, instructional design, digital badge, university extension courses","Discussion forums;Conferences;Reflection;Electronic learning;Urban areas;Proposals","","4","","13","IEEE","1 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These heterogeneous information systems not only have difference in platform construction, geography location, business logic storage mode, but also in area professional terminology. In this article, 3 levels of agriculture information systems integrated processing of systems heterogeneity, model heterogeneity and semantic heterogeneity were analyzed separately. Systems heterogeneity refers to different data sources of application system, database system, operation system and hardware platform; model heterogeneity means data sources differentiate in storage mode, semantic heterogeneity indicates information sources have differentiation in Semantics. Agriculture Information Bus (AI-Bus) model was proposed which including 4 levels that are service layer, protocol layer, data layer and routing layer, and achieved rule oriented flexible mechanism, provided configurable process definition, heterogeneous differences of information system were diminished from systematic level and mode level. Since domain ontology has good concept layer structures and rich in semantic relationships, it is important in information resources gathering and knowledge expressing. As to semantic heterogeneity problem appearing in information system integration, agriculture ontology was introduced to represent domain knowledge sharing and reusing, and colligated concept similarity computing method and description similarity computing method. For concept similarity, it includes 3 quantitative calculation indexes that are semantic coincidence ratio, semantic distance and hierarchy depth; for description similarity, it includes 2 quantitative calculation indexes that are relationship similarity and property similarity. Based on concept similarity and description similarity computation results, an ontology mapping approach was presented which solves the interoperation of multi-source heterogeneous information at the semantic level. Through hierarchical model and domain ontology interoperability applied to agricultural information system integration, currently widely existing “information isolated island” can be eliminated, and thus improve business application systems data sharing and service efficiency.","","978-1-4799-0868-4","10.1109/Argo-Geoinformatics.2013.6621966","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6621966","agriculture information system;hiberarchy model;domain ontology;interoperation;ontology mapping;semantic similarity","Semantics;Agriculture;IP networks","","4","","7","IEEE","7 Oct 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The primary concern is how to tap the brains of employees who are retiring, moving on to new jobs or otherwise leaving the company. Of course, there is no one way to create good knowledge retention. This necessitates different approaches for knowledge sharing or knowledge retention. Loss of critical knowledge has been recognized as one of the central problems in an organization like banking sector. In addition, the events like 9/11, where the whole teams or departments with their valuable knowledge were destroyed, make organizations more sensitive of the problem of knowledge loss. Knowledge retention activities and policies need to be institutionalized throughout the organization so that proper transitioning can occur when people leave the organization. Banks have to develop a simple process to capture the undocumented knowledge of employees nearing retirement andt also for the new employees from the beginning stages.","2155-6830","978-1-4244-4913-2","10.1109/ICEEI.2009.5254717","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5254717","","Knowledge management;Information technology;Banking;Retirement;Information analysis;Programming profession;Informatics;Production;Organizing;Business","","3","","20","IEEE","22 Sep 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The joint optimization between application and MAC enables mapping of video frames based on its priority and network traffic load. The MAC and transport layer are jointly optimized to regulate data rate from transport layer based on congestion information of Access Category (AC) queue. The proposed system is compared with Enhanced Distributed Channel Access (EDCA) and Static Mapping approaches using evaluation criteria, namely Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR), Average End-to-End Delay and Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR). According to the simulation results, it is found that PDR and PSNR of the proposed method are better than that of aforementioned mapping approaches. However, the Average End-to-End Delay is a little bit larger than that of EDCA but less than that of Static approach. Hence, it can be concluded that the proposed method is appropriate for non real-time video streaming applications.","","978-1-4577-0424-6","10.1109/ECTICON.2011.5947851","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5947851","Access category queue;Cross-layer design;Dynamic mapping;EDCA;MPEG-4;Static mapping;QoS;Video streaming","Merging;Computers;Communication systems;Transform coding","","3","2","13","IEEE","11 Jul 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Some major deficiencies of existing tools include the lack of support for modeling dynamic knowledge and knowledge management. To address the inadequacies, the focus of this work is on knowledge management and dynamic knowledge modeling. To address the first objective of knowledge management, a Class Editor, which supports management of static knowledge, has been developed. The Class Editor supports knowledge sharing and re-use by automatically managing author information and access rights in a peer-to-peer environment. To address the second objective of modeling dynamic knowledge, a Protege plug-in, called Dyna, has been developed, which supports dynamic knowledge modeling. Task behaviour, which is a component of dynamic knowledge, is being modeled using Task Behaviour Language (TBL), and test cases for task behaviour can be created in TBL. Test cases are runnable, enabling verification that the model is working as expected. The dynamic knowledge models are stored in XML and can be shared and re-used.

With the help of this framework, organizations can think more strategically about how to improve team knowledge -- for example the planning of kick-offs, what to focus on in face-to-face meetings and how the team members work together on a day-to-day basis. The framework may also be used to assist in planning team composition, for example based on individuals' knowledge and the overlap with other team members' knowledge. The framework uses four broad categories of team knowledge: task-related, team-related, process-related and goal-related. Beneath these four categories the framework details and describes more concrete knowledge types. We also provide examples from software practice for each knowledge type.","2329-6313","978-1-5090-2680-7","10.1109/ICGSE.2016.22","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7577435","virtual teams;globally distributed teams;shared team knowledge;agile;distributed agile;shared mental models","Software;Virtual groups;Cognitive science;Context;Software engineering;Organizations","","3","","31","IEEE","29 Sep 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

By finding experts in social networks and determining their level of knowledge, the validity of their posts could be determined. Therefore a solution to the mentioned problem is to provide a method for expert finding. In this research a novel model based on social network analysis is proposed to find the experts who are the members of social networks by means of business intelligence approach. This model is verified by real data from Friendfeed social network. First, data is extracted, transformed and loaded to data warehouse with ETL processes.

The participants were employed within 22 different municipalities, and were project leaders, planners, coordinators, IT-experts or consultants. The participants' main perception of a smart city was within the smart economy, which incorporates technology and innovation to strengthen business development, employment and urban growth. The participants also perceived some individual positive effects within the smart city project. The 22 involved municipalities were very different in terms of size, populations, economies, and organizations, as well as the technical and contextual support of smart city solutions. Therefore, there seems to be room for improved knowledge sharing among the municipalities in the project. The huge differences also put an emphasis on the challenges of evaluating smart city projects, and there is a need for more in-depth qualitative approaches for understanding the more specific needs (goals, aims) and the contextual background of the municipalities.","","978-1-5386-5017-2","10.1109/SCSP.2018.8402650","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8402650","Smart cities;evaluations;perceptions;knowledge sharing","Smart cities;Logic gates;Planning;Economics;Companies;Technological innovation","","3","","24","IEEE","5 Jul 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Taipei City Government set up Easy Teaching Web of Taipei, integrates scattered knowledge in the field of education and human resources, and build a knowledge-sharing platform for teachers. However, it is still important to understand how to improve the usage of Easy Teaching Web of Taipei to teachers. This research applied the Technology Acceptance Model as research foundation, and the Information Systems Success Model was also considered as impact factor in this research, to understand the teachers to the satisfaction of the digital platform. There are 318 valid samples by random selected from members to fill out a developed pencil-paper questionnaire. The multiple-regression was used for data analysis, the empirical results lead to four conclusions. First, Information Quality (IQ) can predict Perceived Usefulness (PU) and Perceived Ease of Use (PEOU). Second, System Quality (SQ) can predict PU and PEOU. Third, PEOU can predict PU and Attitude toward using (ATU). Fourth, ATU can predict User Satisfaction (US). According to research finding that Easy Teaching Web can promote the user satisfaction by improve easy use of the system.","","978-1-4244-9718-8","10.1109/ICCSE.2011.6028748","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6028748","IS Success Model;TAM;ET Web","Educational institutions;Correlation;Information systems;Reliability;Mathematical model;Internet","","3","","13","IEEE","26 Sep 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
