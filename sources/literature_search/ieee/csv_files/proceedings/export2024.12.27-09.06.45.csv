But there is a contradiction between the incentives of the crowdsourcer and the quality of result of the crowds. In order to balance this conflict, the paper develops a profit optimization model for all parties in crowdsourcing by employing Tullock Contests. The model consists of two parts. Firstly, optimized incentives are provided by crowdsourcer to encourage workers to achieve a better quality of result. Secondly, an optimal fee schedule is provided as guidance to workers. The visualization of the equilibria of benefits is helpful to reach a win-win situation for crowdsourcer and crowds, which in turn impacts the development of crowdsourcing services.

The most common way that crowdsourcing can facilitate machine learning is to annotate instances with labels [1] . However, the same instance may have inconsistent class labels, in the eyes of various annotators. Therefore, current efforts in crowdsourcing mainly focus on the truth inference or label integration, to remove inconsistent labels or to alleviate biased labeling. In turn, instances with the integrated labels could facilitate the training on machine learning models. The future direction of crowdsourcing is to apply more fine-grained truth inference methods to different application domains [2] . Consequently, we evolve toward another challenging problem of comment integration. That is, how can we integrate or summarize the core opinions of multiple product comments obtained from users, rather than the discrete labels.","2375-026X","979-8-3503-2227-9","10.1109/ICDE55515.2023.00350","China Scholarship Council; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10184858","","Crowdsourcing;Training;Q-learning;Machine learning;Organizations;Data engineering;Labeling","","","","2","IEEE","26 Jul 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In crowdsourcing, a service provider needs to evaluate each worker on the basis of their contribution in order to fairly reward workers, so the provider is required to manage the private data of workers, e.g., trajectories and behaviors of workers. However, in crowdsourcing, a single service provider manages all the private data of workers, so there is a possibility that this data might be leaked or manipulated when the provider is attacked by malicious users. Moreover, employees of a service provider might abuse the private data of workers. To solve these problems, we propose managing the private data of workers by using the blockchain for crowdsourcing. In particular, we focus on a type of crowdsourcing in which workers have a direct contract with the service provider providing a service to users, e.g., Uber Eats. Moreover, we also propose a method for evaluating worker scores that uses an entropy weight to weight each evaluation criterion of workers on the basis of the distribution of each criterion. Through a computer simulation using data of cycling conditions obtained by the motion sensor of smartphones attached to bicycles, we evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed system when applied to worker evaluation for a food delivery service, e.g., Uber Eats.","2166-9589","978-1-6654-8053-6","10.1109/PIMRC54779.2022.9977851","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9977851","","Crowdsourcing;Computer simulation;Stability criteria;Bicycles;Throughput;Entropy;Blockchains","","","","21","IEEE","20 Dec 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, with the registration of a large number of testers and the release of test tasks, the platform is faced with the problem that task publishers have difficulty in selecting high-quality personnel and personalized matching tasks, which severely restricts the development of mobile application crowdsourcing testing. Aiming at these problems, this paper firstly analyzes the characteristics of mobile application crowdsourcing test. Then the classifier indexer, personnel predictor and task predictor are generated.

These problems make the developers browse dozens of documents in order to synthesize an appropriate solution. To address these two problems, we propose CROKAGE (Crowd Knowledge Answer Generator), a tool that takes the description of a programming task (the query) and provides a comprehensive solution for the task. Our solutions contain not only relevant code examples but also their succinct explanations. Our proposed approach expands the task description with relevant API classes from Stack Overflow Q&A threads and then mitigates the lexical gap problems. Furthermore, we perform natural language processing on the top quality answers and then return such programming solutions containing code examples and code explanations unlike earlier studies. We evaluate our approach using 97 programming queries, of which 50% was used for training and 50% was used for testing, and show that it outperforms six baselines including the state-of-art by a statistically significant margin.

Such automated approaches should aim to classify questions as good or bad for a particular forum as soon as they are posted based on the guidelines and quality standards defined/listed by the forum. Thus, if a question meets the standard of the forum then it is classified as good else we classify it as bad. In this paper, we propose a method to address this problem of question classification by retrieving similar questions previously asked in the same forum, and then using the text from these previously asked similar questions to predict the quality of the current question. We empirically validate our proposed approach on the set of StackOverflow data, a massive CQA forum for programmers, comprising of about 8M questions. With the use of these additional text retrieved from similar questions, we are able to improve the question quality prediction accuracy by about 2.8% and improve the recall of negatively scored questions by about 4.2%. This improvement of 4.2% in recall would be helpful in automatically flagging questions as bad (unsuitable) for the forum and will speed up the moderation process thus saving time and human effort.","","978-1-4503-3854-7","10.1145/2808797.2809318","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7403703","","Feature extraction;Electronic mail;Predictive models;Social network services;Guidelines;Software;Programming","","13","","25","","11 Feb 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To maximize the chances of winning gamification rewards such as reputation and badges, a portion of users race to post answers as quickly as possible (i.e., fast answers or FAs), which makes SO the fastest Q&A site; however, this behavior may affect the contribution quality as well. In this paper, we report on a large-scale, mixed-methods empirical study of the gamification-influenced FA phenomenon in SO. We first quantitatively investigate the popularity of the phenomenon and user behaviors regarding FAs. Then, we study the quality of FAs by using regression modeling and qualitatively analyzing 300 instances of FAs. Our main findings reveal that more than 70% and 90% of FAs are not edited by the answerers and other users, respectively, and that later incoming answers have lower chances of being voted on and accepted. Notably, we find that the answer length, code snippets length, and readability of FAs are significantly lower than those of non-fast answers. Although FAs have higher crowd assessment scores, they have no relationship with acceptance from the perspective of asker assessment, and a considerable portion of FAs solve the problem by interacting with the asker in the comments. These results help us better understand the effects of reward-based gamification on crowdsourced software engineering communitites and provide implications for designers of gamified systems.","2576-3148","978-1-7281-5619-4","10.1109/ICSME46990.2020.00013","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9240678","Gamification;fast answer;Q&A community;Stack Overflow","Software maintenance;Analytical models;Conferences;Programming;Software engineering","","4","","51","IEEE","2 Nov 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Although these approaches produce promising results, some researchers criticize that existing approaches are still limited in their repair capability, due to their limited repair templates. Indeed, it is quite difficult to design effective repair templates. An award-wining paper analyzes thousands of manual bug fixes, but summarizes only ten repair templates. Although more bugs are thus repaired, recent studies show such repair templates are still insufficient. We notice that programmers often refer to Stack Overflow, when they repair bugs. With years of accumulation, Stack Overflow has millions of posts that are potentially useful to repair many bugs. The observation motives our work towards mining repair templates from Stack Overflow. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, called SOFix, that extracts code samples from Stack Overflow, and mines repair patterns from extracted code samples. Based on our mined repair patterns, we derived 13 repair templates. We implemented these repair templates in SOFix, and conducted evaluations on the widely used benchmark, Defects4J. Our results show that SOFix repaired 23 bugs, which are more than existing approaches. After comparing repaired bugs and templates, we find that SOFix repaired more bugs, since it has more repair templates. In addition, our results also reveal the urgent need for better fault localization techniques.","","978-1-5386-4969-5","10.1109/SANER.2018.8330202","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8330202","program repair;Stack Overflow;repair template","Maintenance engineering;Computer bugs;Data mining;Tools;Manuals;Benchmark testing","","80","","58","IEEE","5 Apr 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This information can be treated as numerous URLs (Uniform Resource Locators), which can be categorized into URLs of Q&As and URLs in Q&As. The domain of former ones is Stack-Overflow itself, while domains of latter ones are miscellaneous, such as some personal blogs and so on. Although each Q&A has been manually assigned tags, relations between URLs and tags are not clear enough. In this paper, we propose SOLinker, a method to build semantic links between various URLs and tags. Firstly, SOLinker identifies proper relations from a predefined relation set between tags and URLs, which is modeled as a text classification problem. Features are extracted from content of Q&A, the URL and the tag list, and classification algorithms are Logistic Regression and Gradient Boosting Decision Tree, depending on the category of URLs. Secondly, there exists a partial tagging problem, which means for a URL in a Q&A, there are only a part of tags of the Q&A relating to the URL. To address this problem, we propose a semantic analysis method to analyze context of this URL and the URL itself from both implicit and explicit aspects. Then SOLinker will infer proper tags by the label propagation technique. Results show that our method is feasible and practical in constructing semantic links between tags and URLs of/in Q&As. In particular, the F-Score of semantic relation identification is around 78%, 5% higher than the other existing method, and F-Score of partial tagging solving is around 88%.","0730-3157","978-1-4673-8845-0","10.1109/COMPSAC.2016.194","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7552075","Text Classification;URL Classification;Label Propagation;StackOverflow","Semantics;Uniform resource locators;Feature extraction;Tagging;Context;Couplings;Data mining","","1","","31","IEEE","25 Aug 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Available information include vibrant discussions and oftentimes ready-to-use code snippets. Previous research identified Stack Overflow as one of the most important information sources developers rely on. Anecdotes report that software developers copy and paste code snippets from those information sources for convenience reasons. Such behavior results in a constant flow of community-provided code snippets into production software. To date, the impact of this behaviour on code security is unknown. We answer this highly important question by quantifying the proliferation of security-related code snippets from Stack Overflow in Android applications available on Google Play. Access to the rich source of information available on Stack Overflow including ready-to-use code snippets provides huge benefits for software developers. However, when it comes to code security there are some caveats to bear in mind: Due to the complex nature of code security, it is very difficult to provide ready-to-use and secure solutions for every problem. Hence, integrating a security-related code snippet from Stack Overflow into production software requires caution and expertise. Unsurprisingly, we observed insecure code snippets being copied into Android applications millions of users install from Google Play every day. To quantitatively evaluate the extent of this observation, we scanned Stack Overflow for code snippets and evaluated their security score using a stochastic gradient descent classifier. In order to identify code reuse in Android applications, we applied state-of-the-art static analysis. Our results are alarming: 15.4% of the 1.3 million Android applications we analyzed, contained security-related code snippets from Stack Overflow. Out of these 97.9% contain at least one insecure code snippet.","2375-1207","978-1-5090-5533-3","10.1109/SP.2017.31","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7958574","Android Application Security;Software Development;Stack Overflow","Androids;Humanoid robots;Cryptography;Libraries;Software;Google","","164","","51","IEEE","26 Jun 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We have applied a stratified random sampling when mining 440,000 GitHub projects to create a dataset representing the change history of the reused snippets; this dataset contains 22,900 GitHub projects, 33,765 Stack Overflow references mapped to 4,634 Stack Overflow posts, and a total of 73,322 commits.We analyze the evolution patterns of snippets on each platform, compare key trends and explore the co-change of these snippets. Our results demonstrate that 76% of snippets evolve on Stack Overflow, while only 22% of the reused code snippets evolve in GitHub. Stack Overflow snippets undergo fewer and smaller changes compared to their evolving counterparts on GitHub. The evolution of snippets on both platforms is driven by the original author of the content.

We also examine the potential debilitating effects of Stack Overflow code snippets security faults and mechanisms for cataloguing security faults for practitioners. Our outcomes reveal that most Stack Overflow code snippets do not possess security faults. However, some code snippets with faults are accepted by the community.

Unfortunately, Crowdsourcing may yield relatively low-quality results if there is no proper quality control. Although previous studies attempt to eliminate workers by estimating workers' qualities via qualification tests or hidden tests, the qualities estimated may not be accurate, because workers may have diverse qualities across tasks. Thus, the quality of the results could be further improved by wisely assigning tasks to the workers who are specialized in the tasks and online task assignment is an effective way to achieve this goal. However, existing crowdsourcing platforms either do not support online task assignment (e.g., CrowdFlower) or are not user-friendly because they require to write complicated codes (e.g., Amazon MTurk). To address these limitations, we develop an online task assignment system, which can on-the-fly assign workers with appropriate tasks. We have deployed our system on top of MTurk. We demonstrate the following scenarios using our system. Firstly, requesters can easily utilize our system to enable online task assignment in order to improve answer quality. Moreover, requesters do not need to write any code. Secondly, our system can infer the quality of workers, and requesters can design and test their own task assignment algorithms using our proposed information. Thirdly, our system can monitor tasks and workers in real time, and the requesters can eliminate bad workers or terminate the crowdsourcing process to reduce the unnecessary cost.","2375-026X","978-1-5386-5520-7","10.1109/ICDE.2018.00193","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8509414","Crowdsourcing;Online;task assignment","Task analysis;Crowdsourcing;Inference algorithms;Databases;Web servers;Real-time systems;Monitoring","","11","","18","IEEE","25 Oct 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Under many circumstances, people want to explore the data in the charts collected from various sources, such as papers and websites, so as to further analyzing the data or creating new charts. However, the existing automatic and semi-automatic approaches are not always effective due to the variety of charts. In this paper, we introduce a crowdsourcing approach that leverages human ability to extract data from visualization charts. There are several challenges. The first one is how to avoid tedious human interaction with charts and design simple crowdsourcing tasks. Second, it is challenging to evaluate worker's quality for truth inference, because workers may not only provide inaccurate values but also misalign values to wrong data series.

Volunteers participate and compete for this activity and best solution provider gets the reward. This approach proves to be beneficial in reducing the overall cost of the project, getting more innovative solutions, high and good quality of software and many more. The benefits of Crowdsourcing Software Development motivated us to investigate the perception of Indian crowd towards this way of software development. A questionnaire-based survey was used and responses from 144 respondents who practice software development were analyzed through Exploratory Factor Analysis to understand the behavior of the crowd. Our study reveals that, although more than half of our respondents had participated in crowdsourcing, their experiences displayed quite a diversity. The developers tend to show positive attitude and they are motivated to earn money and learn. Lack of time to participate in such activity appears to be a concern.","","978-1-5090-6471-7","10.1109/CCAA.2017.8229934","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8229934","Crowdsourcing Software Development;Exploratory Factor Analysis;Motivation","Software;Crowdsourcing;Organizations;Automation;Interviews;Software engineering","","5","","29","IEEE","21 Dec 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Therefore query processing over uncertain data has become an active research field. In the well-known class of applications commonly referred to as “top-K queries”, the objective is to find the best K objects matching the user's information need, formulated as a scoring function over the objects' attribute values. If both the data and the scoring function are deterministic, the best K objects can be univocally determined and totally ordered so as to produce a single ranked result set (as long as ties are broken by some deterministic rule). However, in application scenarios involving uncertain data and fuzzy information needs, this does not hold: when either the attribute values or the scoring function are nondeterministic, there may be no consensus on a single ordering, but rather a space of possible orderings. To determine the correct ordering, one needs to acquire additional information so as to reduce the amount of uncertainty associated with the queried data and consequently the number of orderings in such a space. An emerging trend in data processing is crowdsourcing, defined as the systematic engagement of humans in the resolution of tasks through online distributed work. Our approach combines human and automatic computation in order to solve complex problems: when data ambiguity can be resolved by human judgment, crowdsourcing becomes a viable tool for converging towards a unique or at least less uncertain query result. The goal of this paper is to define and compare task selection policies for uncertainty reduction via crowdsourcing, with emphasis on the case of top-K queries.","","978-1-5090-2020-1","10.1109/ICDE.2016.7498370","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7498370","","Uncertainty;Crowdsourcing;Measurement uncertainty;Entropy;Probability density function;Noise measurement;Query processing","","4","","4","IEEE","23 Jun 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We compared association rule mining and crowdsourcing as automated methods for generating a knowledge base of problem-medication pairs using a single source of clinical data from a commercially available EHR. The association rule mining and crowdsourcing approaches identified 19,586 and 31,440 pairs respectively. When comparing the top 500 pairs from each approach, only 186 overlapped. Manual inspection of the pairs indicated that crowdsourcing identified mostly common relationships, while association rule mining identified a combination of common and rare relationships.

This improves the mobility of IT engineers between projects inside the organization. However, there is a limit to the types of IT engineers that one organization can have. In this report, we propose a hybrid sourcing approach. It integrates the two sourcing strategies to develop software - crowdsourcing and inner-sourcing. This approach distributes the development tasks to either software crowdsourcing or inner-sourcing according to task type. As a case study, we adopt hybrid sourcing approach for an industrial project. The project developed a web application system for a bus company. We evaluate the effectiveness and future issues of hybrid sourcing.","","978-1-4503-7093-6","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10148852","Sourcing Strategy;Crowdsourcing;Inner-sourcing;Microtasking;Microtask Distribution","Crowdsourcing;Codes;Companies;Security;Task analysis;Open source software;Software engineering","","1","","9","","14 Jun 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We show considerations taken to adequately adapt the laboratory-based test to the remote-labour approach. Once all pair-comparison answers were collected, preference choice matrices were built and the Bradley-Terry-Luce probabilistic choice model was applied to estimate a ratio scale of preferences, reflecting the voice likability scores. Our results show a strong correlation between the scores obtained by the two approaches considered, which indicates the validity of crowdsourcing for the acquisition of voice likability ratings.

Usually the crowdsourcing process enables redundancy in the collected labels in order to ensure the correctness of item labels. However, workers on the crowdsourcing platform may make mistakes on some items, leading to inconsistent labels. In this case, it is important to aggregate these noisy labels and obtain the true labels of the items. The correctness of the item label provided by a worker depends on both the worker's ability and the property of the item. However, most of the existing models consider the effect of workers' abilities but ignore that of the item properties. In this paper, we propose a novel crowdsourcing aggregation method (IProWA) which incorporates the modeling of not only worker expertise level but also item property. In particular, items are represented by a K dimensional vector (i.e., item parameter), where K is the number of possible categories and each dimension represents a category. The proposed model transforms the true label estimation into the estimation of item parameters as it connects the true label and the parameters of an item. In worker modeling, it models the different category propensities among different worker groups. Experimental results show that the performance of the proposed model is comparable to that of the state-of-the-art baselines and the learned item parameters can help interpret the property of that item.","","978-1-7281-0858-2","10.1109/BigData47090.2019.9005518","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9005518","crowdsourcing;item parameter estimation;probabilistic graphical model","Crowdsourcing;Estimation;Labeling;Aggregates;Noise measurement;Transforms;Big Data","","1","","20","IEEE","24 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Crowdsourcing as a recent technique for data acquisition is a low-cost and fast method for building relevance judgments. One of the most important issues for using crowdsourcing instead of human expert assessors is the quality of crowdsourcing in building relevance judgments. In order to assess this issue, factors that may have significant effects on the quality of crowdsourcing relevance judgments should be identified. The main objective of this study is to find out whether cognitive characteristics of crowdsourced workers significantly associated with quality of crowdsourced judgments, and to evaluate the effect(s) that each of those characteristics may have on judgment quality, as compared with the gold standard dataset (i.e. human assessment). Thus, the judgments of the crowdsourced workers is compared to that of a human judgment, as the overlap between relevance assessments, and by comparing the system effectiveness evaluation provided by human judgment and from worker assessors. In this study, we assess the effects of the cognitive ability namely logical reasoning ability on quality of relevance judgment.

For that, we present a feasibility study of an original protocol based on indicators that quantify the recognition quality in both semantic and semiotic ways.

The evolution of smart mobile users (SMUs), specifically due to high end mobile devices in terms of resources and capabilities has contributed towards the concept of collaborative task completion and a notion of crowdsourcing. Under general scenario of mobile crowdsourcing, an application based platform (task requester) tries to motivate a number of available participating users for completing a specific task by introducing certain incentive mechanism. However, the challenge remains in improving users' participation for a better result as not all users have similar attitude for a task due to resource constraints(energy profile), time, mobility, privacy issues and so on. Therefore, to address this situation, in this paper we propose users' response profile based incentive mechanism for improving participation that incorporates users' behavior and inconvenience metrics upon joining crowdsourcing. Secondly, we formulate utility based optimal task load allocation considering energy constraints of SMUs. Simulation results show response driven incentive mechanism supports platform owner to design an appropriate task load allocation scheme without overwhelming SMU's energy constraint and eventually loosing participation.","","978-1-5386-2290-2","10.1109/ICOIN.2018.8343156","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8343156","Mobile Crowdsourcing;User Profiling;Incentive Mechanism;Utility Maximization","Task analysis;Resource management;Load modeling;Crowdsourcing;Training;Simulation;Optimization","","","","20","IEEE","23 Apr 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To tackle these challenges, a task assignment method based on attribute signature with verifiable capability is proposed in this paper, by which the task publisher can specify the requirements of workers' capability.

These methods are used in the thesis concept for data mining using classification techniques to discover unknown categories of data. This includes decision trees, Logistic Regression, random forests Classifier, and k-nearest neighbor algorithm, with an evaluation of each method showing the best result using classification techniques that were the best result using the 98% decision trees and random forests Classifier technique while is more than adequate.

In order to improve quality of outputs in crowdsourcing, it is important to assign workers to tasks they are good at. In multiclass classification tasks, which are common in crowdsourcing, sometimes different workers are good at different subcategories. It suggests that we can improve the accuracy of a multiclass classification task by reorganizing the task into a hierarchical classification task, and assigning workers to appropriate sub-tasks in the hierarchy. We experimentally show that we can actually improve the accuracy of a classification task by this approach. We collected performance data of workers in a flat multiclass classification task on Amazon Mechanical Turk, and simulated the process of the reorganization and the worker allocation. We confirmed that the output in the simulation achieves higher accuracy than that of the original flat classification task.","","978-1-5386-2715-0","10.1109/BigData.2017.8258467","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8258467","crowdsourcing;classification;hierarchical","Crowdsourcing;Dogs;Resource management;Informatics;Electronic mail","","","","5","IEEE","15 Jan 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

With spatial crowdsourcing(SC), a major challenge is to assign reliable workers to nearby tasks. The goal of such task assignment process is to maximize the task completion in the face of uncertainty. Two modes of task assignment have been proposed by Kazemi and Shahabi: worker select task(WST) and server assign task(SAT). In our paper, we propose a SAT model on the dynamic task assignment problem in spatial crowdsourcing. We present the minimum-cost maximum-utility assignment (MC-MUA) problem in spatial crowdsourcing and aim to maximize utility as well as minimize the traveling costs of tasks in spatial. We present the optimal algorithm to solve the problem in a polynomial time using synthetic datasets and conduct the simulation experiment.

Crowdsourcing based linear regression is an efficient way for function estimation when many labels are available for each instance. However, methods in literature have a poor performance against large noise and outliers in labels. To tackle this problem, we proposed a novel robust crowdsourcing-based linear regression derived from information theoretic learning. The proposed problem is not convex, but it can be efficiently solved by half quadratic programming. The proposed model has a close relation with weighted crowdsourcing-based linear regression, in which labels of each annotator weight adaptively and iteratively.

In contrast, we address the task assignment problem in spatial crowdsourcing platforms from an egalitarian perspective. An egalitarian approach aims to optimise the expectation of all entities involved. Specifically, we aim to minimise the waiting time for the customers and workers, while maximising the profit earned by the platform. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the only study that achieves this objective in a fully-online setting, with deadlines for both customers and workers. We propose two heuristic algorithms to solve the problem, and evaluate our algorithms on a real taxi-trips records dataset.

However, it is difficult to automatically identify reliable information sources in foreign countries for several reasons. First, what kind of information sources are reliable heavily depend on each county situation. In some countries people trust their government’s official information but in other countries they do not. Secondly, such reliable information sources often provide information in their local languages. Reliable information sources are not necessarily top-ranked by search engines. Crowdsourcing is a promising way to deal with such a case. However, crowd-sourcing platforms do not cover crowds in all countries. In this study, we report some results of our attempt to collect local information regarding COVID-19 from several countries through multi-hop crowdsourcing, in which we allow crowd workers on a crowdsourcing platform to use other platforms in other countries.

We provide a novel technique to extract Android API elements used by Apps that developers change between releases. We find that high App churn leads to lower user ratings. For example, we find that on average, per release, poorly rated Apps change 140 methods compared to the 82 methods changed by positively rated Apps. Our findings suggest that developers should not release new features at the expense of churn and user ratings. We also investigate the link between how frequently API classes and methods are changed by App developers relative to the amount of discussion of these code elements on StackOverflow. Our findings indicate that classes and methods that are changed frequently by App developers are in more posts on StackOverflow.

However, the challenge of noise in existing data has been ignored, leading models can’t generate higher quality titles. To address this issue, we propose the K-clusters confidence learning for code titles (KCL-CT) model, which contains code clustering and confident learning (CL) denoising components. Specifically, the code clustering component is used to capture the word order and semantic information in code and classify code into different functional categories. The CL denoising component receives the output from the code clustering component and employs a heuristic method based on a confidence threshold to prune raw datasets. We conducted experiments based on Java, Python, JavaScript, SQL and C# datasets, the results of which indicated that in terms of the BLEU and ROUGE scores, the proposed KCL-CT model can outperform previous state-of-the-art models by 2.0%–11.1% and 2.5%–14.0%, respectively.","","978-1-6654-5218-2","10.1109/PAAP56126.2022.10010656","National Natural Science Foundation of China; Natural Science Foundation of Liaoning Province; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10010656","StackOverflow;Developer community;Confident learning","Java;Codes;Recurrent neural networks;Noise reduction;Semantics;Programming;Transformers","","","","32","IEEE","11 Jan 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This wide availability of data led researchers to develop techniques to mine Stack Overflow posts. The aim is to find and recommend posts with information useful to developers. However, and not surprisingly, not every Stack Overflow post is useful from a developer's perspective. We empirically investigate what the characteristics of ""useful"" Stack Overflow posts are. The underlying assumption of our study is that posts that were used (referenced in the source code) in the past by developers are likely to be useful. We refer to these posts as leveraged posts. We study the characteristics of leveraged posts as opposed to the non-leveraged ones, focusing on community aspects (e.g., the reputation of the user who authored the post), the quality of the included code snippets (e.g., complexity), and the quality of the post's textual content (e.g., readability). Then, we use these features to build a prediction model to automatically identify posts that are likely to be leveraged by developers. Results of the study indicate that post meta-data (e.g., the number of comments received by the answer) is particularly useful to predict whether it has been leveraged or not, whereas code readability appears to be less useful. A classifier can classify leveraged posts with a precision of 65% and recall of 49% and non-leveraged ones with a precision of 95% and recall of 97%. This opens the road towards an automatic identification of ""high-quality content"" in Stack Overflow.","2470-6892","978-1-7281-4937-0","10.1109/SCAM.2019.00025","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8930891","Recommender Systems;Q&A Forums;Reuse","Java;Complexity theory;Recommender systems;Programming;Software;Documentation;Task analysis","","1","","47","IEEE","12 Dec 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This is not an exception in the software engineering domain. Nowadays, API has become imperative in making software developers’ life easier. APIs help developers implement a function faster and more efficiently. However, given the large number of open-source libraries to choose from, choosing the right APIs is not a simple task. Previous studies on API recommendation leverage natural language (query) to identify which API would be suitable for the given task. However, these studies only consider one source of input, i.e., GitHub or Stack Overflow, independently. There are no existing approaches that utilize Stack Overflow to help generate better API sequence recommendations from queries obtained from GitHub. Therefore, in this study, we aim to provide a framework that could improve the result of the API sequence recommendation by leveraging information from Stack Overflow. In this work, we propose Picaso, which leverages contrastive learning to train a sentence embedding model and a cross-encoder model to build a classification model in order to find a semantically similar Stack Overflow post given an annotation (i.e., code comment). Subsequently, Picaso then uses the Stack Overflow’s title as a query expansion. Picaso then uses the extended queries to fine-tune a CodeBERT, resulting in an API sequence generation model. Based on our experiments, we found that incorporating the Stack Overflow information into CodeBERT would improve the performance of API sequence generation’s BLEU-4 score by 10.8%.","2574-3864","979-8-3503-1184-6","10.1109/MSR59073.2023.00025","Ministry of Education; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10174238","API recommendation;Multi-source analytics;Sequence Generation;Pre-trained Models;Stack Overflow;Query Expansion","Analytical models;Codes;Annotations;Natural languages;Software;Libraries;Data mining","","1","","37","IEEE","12 Jul 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The premise is that the public would be better served if it had access to reliable, near real-time information concerning the ""ground truth"" (actual observations and pictures) of unfolding events. One way (of many) to collect those reports is through crowdsourcing. By taking advantage of the army of people connected to the internet via both wired and wireless technologies, we can easily gather information that would help a citizen make an informed decision regarding his or her health and welfare (e.g., shelter-in-place vs. flight). The widespread use of smartphones allows people to post geolocated reports and pictures with ease. Disaster management teams would likewise benefit from the input of more observers. On the other hand, the trustworthiness of these reports may be uncertain. For instance, a terrorist group might use crowdsourcing to redirect the community's emergency responses to the wrong place. We first explore how a crowdsourcing system might be used to enhance disaster management, and then we investigate three ways to enhance the trust that the citizen places in such a system.","1095-2055","978-1-4673-1544-9","10.1109/ICCCN.2012.6289256","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6289256","","Smart phones;Reliability;Mobile communication;Educational institutions;Machine learning;Game theory;Disaster management","","18","","15","IEEE","30 Aug 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Generally pre-measured solution can provide high quality data but it needs lots of labor and time. Different from pre-measured solution, crowdsourcing is an economic and efficient way to obtain location information. WFP based on Clustering (WFP-C) in mobile crowdsourcing system is proposed to improve positioning accuracy and reduce computation complexity. WFP-C includes three phases: offline database building, dataset preprocessing and online positioning. In offline database building phase, Android-based APP is developed to collect crowdsourcing data. In dataset preprocessing phase, according to some clustering algorithm, the geography area is divided into several fingerprint clusters which are identified by Position Feature Vectors (PFVs). In online positioning phase, two-stage matching method is proposed. Firstly, the WiFi signal vector is used to match some cluster according to PFVs. And then, the accurate position is calculate using the WiFi signal vector of the cluster. The Android-based APP is installed in smart phones which are carried by ten volunteers. The collected data is used to evaluated our proposal. The experiment compares WFP-C, grid-based WFP and non-cluster WFP. The evaluation results indicate that WFP-C can achieve higher positioning accuracy and low computation complexity.","2473-9464","978-1-5090-2508-4","10.1109/ICCSE.2017.8085498","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8085498","WIFI fingerprint positioning;clustering;crowdsourcing","Wireless fidelity;Fingerprint recognition;Crowdsourcing;Clustering algorithms;Global Positioning System;Databases;Algorithm design and analysis","","11","","22","IEEE","30 Oct 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Existing works address the job assignment problem solely from the perspective of the crowdsourcer, aiming at maximizing the utility or minimizing the cost for the crowdsourcer. In this paper, we take into consideration users' preferences towards different jobs, and propose a novel matching framework for job assignment in crowdsourcing systems. Assigning multiple users to the same job will improve its quality, however, the crowdsourcer has to guarantee that the total payment to these users is less than the budget of this job. As users ask for different payments due to heterogeneity in their quality levels, classic deferred acceptance algorithm cannot reach a stable job assignment. In this paper, we formulate the job assignment problem in crowdsourcing systems as a many-to-one matching with budget constraints. Then, we design an algorithm that produces a stable job assignment in spite of user heterogeneity. Simulation results show that the proposed job assignment algorithm yields a high average job quality with a low computational complexity.","","978-1-5090-5019-2","10.1109/GLOCOM.2017.8254454","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8254454","","Crowdsourcing;Algorithm design and analysis;Computer science;Resource management;Software engineering;Information science","","11","","9","IEEE","15 Jan 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The proposed system is composed of three parts: a smart probe car crowds (SPC-crowd) that serve as the anomaly data source; cloud servers that are the core for the anomaly classification; and application services that provide various innovative applications to facilitate the pavement maintenance. To support the crowdsourcing procedure, in the SPC-crowd side, we proposed cross-SPC techniques by adopting the underdamped oscillation model (UOM). In the cloud side, a supervised learning classification model was adopted on the anomaly data generated from the SPC-crowd. To validate the proposed system, extensive field trial was performed.
