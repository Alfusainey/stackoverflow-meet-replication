The virtual forums allow sharing knowledge in English. A content analysis, observations, and survey investigation were the methods for collecting data. As a result, the analysis encompassed 2,081 messages posted on forty English-speaking forums for observing forum knowledge-sharing structures. The data set also includes 206 valid survey responses. The findings indicate that forum members have different knowledge levels in the 2D or 3D design fields. The numbers of forum members willing to reply Q&A questions on a forum discussion board may be an indicator of the quality of active operation of the forum. Finally, this study suggests posting some senior forum members' identities (photo and personal information) with their consent. In addition, results indicate enhancements to the functions of forums' discussion boards would allow automatic categorization of proposed Q&A questions and then directly send them to the proper senior members via email. The value of online forums is expected to contribute to effective interaction among members.","","978-1-4577-0326-3","10.1109/IJCSS.2011.26","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5960274","knowledge management;forum;value creation","Communities;Three dimensional displays;Electronic mail;Animation;Visualization;Education","","","","6","IEEE","21 Jul 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Therefore, knowledge standardization is the development trend of HAZOP and the research direction of this paper. Based on knowledge engineering, using Protégé 5.0 and OWL, the ontology model of HAZOP is constructed, which provides a unified analysis standard for the field of HAZOP. Taking the oil gasifier as an example, according to the SWRL rules, the relationship between entities is established, the HAZOP ontology is constructed, and the results are visualized. At last, the reasoning plug-in is used to analyze the established ontology relationship of HAZOP, which verifies the accuracy of HAZOP analysis results.

To improve the expressiveness of synthetized speech, this paper focuses on the generation of exclamatory and interrogative speech for Mandarin spoken language. We propose a multi-style (exclamatory and interrogative) deep neural network-based acoustic model with a style-specific layer (can have multiple layers) while other layers are shared. The style-specific layer is used to model the distinct style specific patterns. The shared layers allow maximum knowledge sharing between the declarative and multi-style speech. Such method is also validated on different neural networks. Besides, models that adapted on both spectral and F0 parameter is compared with models while only F0 parameter is adapted. Both subjective and objective evaluations show that this method is superior to prior work (which is trained by the combination of constrained Maximum likelihood linear regression (CMLLR) and structural maximum a posterior (SMAP)), and the BLSTM where top 1 layer is style-specific layer that adapted on both spectral and F0 parameter can achieve the best results.","","978-1-5090-4294-4","10.1109/ISCSLP.2016.7918426","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7918426","Speech synthesis;F0 contour;deep neural network adaptation;exclamatory speech;interrogative speech","Hidden Markov models;Speech;Adaptation models;Acoustics;Neural networks;Pragmatics;Training data","","","","33","IEEE","4 May 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

People use the Internet whenever they need information. The primary role of the Internet is changing from that of digital content sharing to that of knowledge sharing. NICT Knowledge Clustered Group is researching and developing information analysis technology for “Universal Communication”. In order to realize universal communications, we have to overcome several barriers. Information analysis is an essential technology to overcome a barrier of “Information Quality”. The overabundance that makes it difficult to extract the most useful information from the Internet is called the information explosion. The amount of consumer generating media (CGM) is increasing particularly rapidly, but the content may be neither valuable nor trusted. Ordinary web search engines cannot evaluate the content. However, if we can evaluate the credibility of information, credible digital content will be as easily accessed knowledge is on the Internet. We believe that information analysis technology to find higher quality information on Web content enables us to overcome a barrier of “Information Quality”.Research project of NICT Knowledge Clustered Group focuses on analysis of information credibility criteria and development of a knowledge cluster system. The former project addresses the information credibility criteria of web content using natural language processing (NLP) technology.

In virtual collaborative work, such common grounds for decision making offered by a shared work context hardly exist. Designing context-aware systems to support decision making in virtual collaboration, thus, poses a huge challenge because of the inherent difficulty in establishing a shared context of work and users adequate for supporting cohesive collaboration and knowledge sharing among individuals across boundaries. To address this problem, this paper proposes a framework, which incorporates an explicit model of context between the domain model of an application and the activity landscapes of various individuals, workgroups and organisations collaborating across borders, and between these landscapes and the knowledge resource space model in an intelligent ubiquitous environment. We suggest that as a result of the high level of knowledge required in collaborative e-work as well as its changing work contexts, e-work support systems need to provide not only information in the form of documents and articles, but also expert-level explanations in the form of supporting literature and references to theories and related cases, to justify retrieved information and offer cognitive support to e-work.","","978-1-4244-8044-9","10.1109/DeSE.2010.35","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5633674","","Decision support systems;Helium","","","","26","IEEE","11 Nov 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Our empirical studies illustrate that different users, such as OTS evaluator, OTS integrator, system tester, and system maintainer, need different information and knowledge about OTS components when facing different scenarios. Although a few companies are using mini-wikis internally to manage and share OTS related knowledge, knowledge sharing across companies is rare. Searching existing web portals or sites of OTS components is time consuming and often does not bring systematic knowledge. This position paper proposes role-based wikis to organize OTS components related knowledge in a systematic way. One motivation of constructing such a wiki is to provide necessary knowledge for different users to help them reduce risks. Another motivation is to provide a global centralized platform, so that OTS users can systematically share their knowledge across organizations.","","978-1-4244-3742-9","10.1109/WIKIS4SE.2009.5069999","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5069999","","Portals;Open source software;Software maintenance;Collaboration;System testing;Knowledge management;Internet;Scattering;Programming;Software testing","","","","17","IEEE","10 Jun 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper describes the development of `SmartNet', an adaptable and interoperable `whole-system' framework incorporating a wide-scale data acquisition, analysis and modeling approach that addresses holistic sustainability imperatives. Initially, a candidate architecture for a scaleable domestic condition monitoring and analytic solution is presented, based on key requirements such as cost-effective system delivery in retrofit contexts. Subsequently, a Bayesian probabilistic method is described that facilitates both short term analysis of building energy performance and subsequent system control. Finally, the application of Bayesian inference networks to longer term wider area strategic decision making imperatives is described. The results show that this robust whole-system approach facilitates multi-scale analysis from single building to national levels whilst managing constraints such as cost. Additionally, solutions to problems associated with the management of uncertainty or incomplete datasets, along with issues related to international cooperation and knowledge sharing are presented.","","978-1-908320-13-1","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6636386","","Heating;Monitoring;Temperature measurement;Temperature sensors;Adaptation models;Benchmark testing;Communities","","","","17","","21 Oct 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Our approach harnesses auxiliary data from diverse applications and user sets to complement the data scarcity. A two-stream Transformer network is devised to enable knowledge transfer between disparate domains and tasks. This network adeptly amalgamates user-discriminative insights from various applications while refining precise embeddings tailored to a target application. Meta-learning optimization is employed to counteract negative knowledge sharing. Furthermore, we introduce a novel data augmentation technique based on feature covariance to bolster the training of robust one-class classifiers.

Properly designed reward distribution schemes can motivate voluntary participants to provide with credible information. The distributed replication of blockchains can increase the information credibility by prohibiting malicious forgery. We also utilize the Amazon cloud system to enhance availability and scalability.

To evaluate data collection options, we collect and compare labels obtained from two popular crowdsourcing platforms. Our results demonstrate the existing crowdsourcing approaches' lack of data quality, underlining the need for a trained expert framework to gather a more reliable dataset. By creating such a framework and gathering a first dataset, we are able to improve Krippendorff's a = 0.144 (crowdsourcing labels) to a = 0.419 (expert labels).

However, how to select crowdsourcing workers with performance maximization is prudent and quite challenging since vehicles are highly dynamic and have unpredictable routes. In this paper, we study the worker selection problem for crowdsourced on-route map collection where the trade- off between the real-time worker exploration and exploitation is the main focus. Specifically, by adopting the multi-armed bandit model, we formulate a cumulative platform utility maximization problem. To solve this problem, we propose an Online Worker Selection (OWS) scheme, to learn drivers' performance and make worker selection decisions in real time. Essentially, two key designs are integrated in OWS: 1) performance transfer. If a new driver joins the crowdsourcing, we will initialize the new driver's performance based on the knowledge transferred from the existing drivers' records; and 2) marginal utility. Particularly, we carefully incorporate the platform utility to embody the marginal effect, i.e., repeated coverage by multiple vehicles on a certain road will undermine the utility. Based on the real-world vehicular GPS trace, we conduct extensive trace- driven simulations, and results demonstrate that our scheme can effectively obtain high-quality environment map, with on average 40.5% crowdsourcing utility gain over other benchmark schemes.","2576-6813","978-1-7281-0962-6","10.1109/GLOBECOM38437.2019.9013516","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9013516","","Crowdsourcing;Roads;Trajectory;Task analysis;Autonomous vehicles;Global Positioning System","","6","","17","IEEE","27 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we propose BAT (Bipartite Attention-driven Truth) to flexibly infer the truth in various scenarios. The key behind BAT is to explore a comprehensive approach from the whole topology of crowdsourcing itself rather than any individual component. Specifically, BAT firstly characterizes the crowdsourcing as an attributed bipartite graph (ABG). Then it deploys a bipartite graph neural network (bi-GNN). The bi-GNN relies on a bipartite attention mechanism for exploiting the importance of different answers to compute the correct one. For verifying BAT, we compare BAT with other eight existing truth inference methods on real-world datasets from different domains (image, text, audio). The results show that BAT performs best on different crowdsourcing tasks.","1945-788X","978-1-6654-3864-3","10.1109/ICME51207.2021.9428269","National Natural Science Foundation of China; Huawei Technologies; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9428269","Truth inference;graph neural network","Crowdsourcing;Network topology;Conferences;Graph neural networks;Bipartite graph;Topology;Proposals","","4","","31","IEEE","9 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper proposes and develops a solution to detect fake news and hence control misinformation broadcasting in social media. Existing solutions for detecting fake news involve either using Machine learning/AI or employing a crowdsourcing-based fact-checker to evaluate the reliability of the information. In our proposed solution - ABC-verify - we designed and developed an integrated framework combining both AI and a Proof-of-stake (PoS) smart contract algorithm for crowdsourcing to achieve better accuracy than AI-only or pure crowdsourcing. The advantage of the proposed solution is two-fold. Firstly, the AI model can continuously learn from the output of the smart contract algorithm. Secondly, the validated news that is added to the blockchain is immutable. The validators from the public Ethereum blockchain stake ERC721 tokens in exchange for a reward if the information reliability were accurate. The prediction from the AI classification model is based on a pre-trained BERT model on a dataset of 10,000 labelled Twitter datasets. The AI classification model proxies as one of the validators in the PoS algorithm. The final verdict from the smart contract is then fed back into the training dataset to improve the AI classification model and achieve better overall accuracy of 93%. Unlike traditional crowdsourcing platforms, news stored within the blockchain is immutable. Furthermore, the Ethereum blockchain is transparent, and every transaction is recorded within the blockchain, hence enabling authenticity and trust between peer-to-peer transactions.","","978-1-6654-6722-3","10.1109/SOLI54607.2021.9672392","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9672392","Blockchain;BERT;Fake news;Tweets;PoS","Crowdsourcing;Training;Social networking (online);Smart contracts;Predictive models;Prediction algorithms;Blockchains","","4","","9","IEEE","13 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This is not a new challenge and already well addressed in usability research. Yet, similar challenges arise in crowdsourcing tasks. While task interfaces are often less complicated than complete software products, crowdsourcing workers have only a minimal amount of time to familiarize them with the task interface. Additionally, due to the repetitiveness of the tasks, workers are required to work with this interface to solve a few hundred tasks. Unfortunately, often little attention is paid to optimize the task interfaces. Even if recent studies have shown evidence of the negative effects of poorly designed interfaces on the work performance, there is less knowledge about the importance of the usability from the worker's point of view and their personal preferences. This work aims to fill this gap in two steps. First, we analyze the relevance of good usability and interface design in relation to other task properties like payment or joyfulness by conducting a survey on two popular crowdsourcing platforms. Second, we identify interface properties that are of importance for the crowdsourcing workers and discuss both consenting and dissenting opinions of different worker groups. The results show that all workers place an essential role in the usability of a task interface when selecting tasks, but do not agree on coherent design preferences within and between the platforms.","2472-7814","978-1-7281-5965-2","10.1109/QoMEX48832.2020.9123094","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9123094","crowdsourcing;usability;task design;survey","Crowdsourcing;Industries;Software;Task analysis;Usability;Optimization","","3","","23","IEEE","23 Jun 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The number of Internet users in India has increased by about 146% in the last five years. The most common news sources today are social media, despite the fact that online newspapers were once very popular. Creating content and disseminating it to the public under the guise of true news from a reliable news source is a major concern. This has led to an increase in the frequency with which people consume “false news.” The dissemination of fake news has severe consequences, including the potential to influence election outcomes. This research focuses on using crowdsourcing to address the challenge of recognising bogus news on the Internet. Crowdsourcing is the practise of gathering data from a sizable number of people, usually online. An efficient method for crowdsourcing fact-checking has been revealed by prior research. In order to stop the spread of false information on the Internet, this work aims to solve the limitations of earlier research studies and build on them to make crowdsourcing a reliable method for fact-checking.

This requirement ensures the authenticity of authenticated users and the fact-checking they do.","","979-8-3503-3828-7","10.1109/ICCCMLA58983.2023.10346853","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10346853","Crowdsourcing;Trust Score;Fact checking","Crowdsourcing;Electric potential;Social networking (online);Filtering;Voting;Web and internet services;Materials reliability","","","","15","IEEE","18 Dec 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"Using crowdsourced data for empirical research in information systems: What it is and how to do it safe?","M.

Crowdsourcing is an appealing concept for collecting practitioners' perceptions on an industry-relevant phenomenon that is of interest to researchers. As practitioners-generated contents are easily available in social media platforms such as practitioners' blogs or professional discussion groups in LinkedIn, researchers face the opportunity to use this crowdsourced information for the purpose of gaining understanding of a situation from the point of view of the professionals involved therein. While there are many benefits of using crowdsourcing for data collection, there are also challenges, all of which pose validity threats of various degrees to the empirical results obtained. This tutorial will provide a systematic understanding of the use of practitioners' crowdsourced data for empirical research purposes, and of the possible ways to safely apply it in IS and SE research. The tutorial leverages the tutor's experience and lessons learned from using practitioners' blogs articles for qualitative research in business-IT alignment and in large scale online games. At the end of the tutorial, attendees should be able to critically reason about (i) the possible choices in designing a crowdsourcing-based research process, (ii) the quality criteria for judging their research designs, and (iii) the criteria for evaluating their studies.","2151-1357","978-1-5386-6517-6","10.1109/RCIS.2018.8406646","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8406646","Croudsourcing;Big Data;Qualitative Research;Empirical Research Method;Validity Threats","Tutorials;Blogs;Data collection;Crowdsourcing;Software engineering;Organizations","","","","8","IEEE","9 Jul 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In crowdsourcing, participants’ behaviors and environmental distractions are not controlled. So, the researcher must pay attention to the answers’ reliability. Cleaning methods exist for direct annotation subjective methodologies. However, solutions for indirect annotation methods are limited. In this work, we propose a method based on the negative log-likelihood to detect spammers among participants from their answers. To demonstrate its use, we applied it in a quadruplet preference-based scenario. The proposed method requires low computation and can be integrated into active-sampling strategies, where annotations available per comparison are small. We demonstrate that our method is robust to various spammer behaviors and accurate by removing only spammers. It helps reduce the gap between data collected in in-lab conditions (i.e., no spammer) and through crowdsourcing: our method reduces estimated uncertainties around data-points by 50%, and RMSE between estimations from an in-lab experiment and the same experiment performed in crowdsourcing by 1.8.","","978-1-7281-9835-4","10.1109/ICIP49359.2023.10222071","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10222071","Spammer removal;crowdsourcing;pair comparison;active-sampling","Crowdsourcing;Maximum likelihood estimation;Maximum likelihood detection;Uncertainty;Annotations;Image processing;Behavioral sciences","","","","28","IEEE","11 Sep 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In Crowdsourcing, the customers belong from diverse locations; thereby, providing the redundant and inconsistent requirements for a targeted software system. To the best of our knowledge, the existing literature lacks in providing a quantitative framework that prioritizes the crucial factors affecting the requirement's management in the Crowdsourcing context. Motivated by this, we propose a quantitative framework that will be effective in ranking the Crowdsourcing-based requirements. For this purpose, the current study intends to identify various factors, that can affect the management of requirements, from the literature and also validates them from the practitioners. To accomplish this, we perform a systematic review and an empirical study. Moreover, we quantify the impact of each factor using the capability of a multi-criteria decision-making oriented Fuzzy- Analytical Hierarchy Process (F-AHP) technique. Subsequently, we also employ a multi-perspective prioritization technique to obtain the data from the relevant personnel to validate the quantified score. To assess the performance of the proposed quantitative framework, we considered a real-world Smart Home case study. Moreover, the efficacy of the adopted F-AHP technique is validated by comparing it with the traditional AHP technique. The results indicate that the F-AHP technique significantly outperformed the baseline technique.","2693-9371","979-8-3503-6565-8","10.1109/QRS-C63300.2024.00090","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10727081","crowd-based requirements engineering;quantitative framework;multi-criteria decision-making;fuzzy AHP;systematic review;empirical study","Crowdsourcing;Requirements management;Software quality;Smart homes;Analytic hierarchy process;Software systems;Reliability engineering;Software reliability;Security;Personnel","","","","49","IEEE","29 Oct 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Its goal is to design and implement text documents classifier prototype based on documents similarity and to design evaluation and crowdsourcing-based classification improvement mechanism. For classification the N-grams algorithm has been chosen, which was implemented in Java. Interface for crowdsourcing was created using CMS WordPress. In addition to data collection, the purpose of interface is to evaluate classification accuracy, which leads to extension of classifier test data set, thus the classification is more successful.

Previous research shows that programmers frequently share and search for reviews of APIs on the mainstream software question and answer (Q&A) platforms like Stack Overflow, which motivates researchers to design tasks and approaches related to process API reviews automatically. Among these tasks, classifying API reviews into different aspects (e.g., performance or security), which is called the aspect-based API review classification, is of great importance. The current state-of-the-art (SOTA) solution to this task is based on the traditional machine learning algorithm. Inspired by the great success achieved by pre-trained models on many software engineering tasks, this study fine-tunes six pre-trained models for the aspect-based API review classification task and compares them with the current SOTA solution on an API review benchmark collected by Uddin et al. The investigated models include four models (BERT, RoBERTa, ALBERT and XLNet) that are pre-trained on natural languages, BERTOverflow that is pre-trained on text corpus extracted from posts on Stack Overflow, and CosSensBERT that is designed for handling imbalanced data. The results show that all the six fine-tuned models outperform the traditional machine learning-based tool. More specifically, the improvement on the F1-score ranges from 21.0% to 30.2%. We also find that BERTOverflow, a model pre-trained on the corpus from Stack Overflow, does not show better performance than BERT. The result also suggests that CosSensBERT also does not exhibit better performance than BERT in terms of F1, but it is still worthy of being considered as it achieves better performance on MCC and AUC.","1534-5351","978-1-6654-3786-8","10.1109/SANER53432.2022.00054","Ministry of Education, Singapore(grant numbers:MOE2019-T2-1-193); Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; University of Calgary; Alberta Innovates; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9825884","software mining;natural language processing;multi-label classification;pre-trained models","Software libraries;Machine learning algorithms;Bit error rate;Natural languages;Transformers;Software;Data models","","19","","39","IEEE","21 Jul 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To address this question, we identify Stack Overflow code snippets that contain security errors and find clones of these snippets in open source GitHub repositories. We then survey (n=133) and interview (n=15) the authors of these GitHub repositories to explore how and why these errors were introduced. We find that some developers (perhaps mistakenly) trust their security skills to validate the code they import, but the majority admit they would need to learn more about security before they could properly perform such validation. Further, although some prioritize functionality over security, others believe that ensuring security is not, or should not be, their responsibility.

With a few notable exceptions, empirical software engineering studies have exploited off-the-shelf sentiment analysis tools. However, such tools have been trained on non-technical domains and general-purpose social media, thus resulting in misclassifications of technical jargon and problem reports. In particular, Jongeling et al. show how the choice of the sentiment analysis tool may impact the conclusion validity of empirical studies because not only these tools do not agree with human annotation of developers' communication channels, but they also disagree among themselves. Our goal is to move beyond the limitations of off-the-shelf sentiment analysis tools when applied in the software engineering domain. Accordingly, we present Senti4SD, a sentiment polarity classifier for software developers' communication channels. Senti4SD exploits a suite of lexicon-based, keyword-based, and semantic features for appropriately dealing with the domain-dependent use of a lexicon. We built a Distributional Semantic Model (DSM) to derive the semantic features exploited by Senti4SD. Specifically, we ran word2vec on a collection of over 20 million documents from Stack Overflow, thus obtaining word vectors that are representative of developers' communication style. The classifier is trained and validated using a gold standard of 4,423 Stack Overflow posts, including questions, answers, and comments, which were manually annotated for sentiment polarity. We release the full lab package, which includes both the gold standard and the emotion annotation guidelines, to ease the execution of replications as well as new studies on emotion awareness in software engineering. To inform future research on word embedding for text categorization and information retrieval in software engineering, the replication kit also includes the DSM. Results. The contribution of the lexicon-based, keyword-based, and semantic features is assessed by our empirical evaluation leveraging different feature settings. With respect to SentiStrength, a mainstream off-the-shelf tool that we use as a baseline, Senti4SD reduces the misclassifications of neutral and positive posts as emotionally negative. Furthermore, we provide empirical evidence of better performance also in presence of a minimal set of training documents.","1558-1225","978-1-4503-5638-1","10.1145/3180155.3182519","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8453070","Sentiment Analysis;Communication Channels;Stack Overflow;Word Embedding;Social Software Engineering","Software;Software engineering;Collaboration;Programming","","6","","","","2 Sep 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Through the investigation of API misuse scenarios on Stack Overflow, we identify three barriers that hinder the understanding of the API usage directives, i.e., lack of specific usage context, indirect relationships to cooperative APIs, and confusing APIs with subtle differences. To overcome these barriers, we develop a text mining approach to discover the crowdsourced API misuse scenarios on Stack Overflow and extract from these scenarios erroneous code examples and patches, as well as related API and confusing APIs to construct demystification reports to help developers understand the official API usage directives described in natural language. We apply our approach to API usage directives in official Android API documentation and android-tagged discussion threads on Stack Overflow. We extract 159,116 API misuse scenarios for 23,969 API usage directives of 3138 classes and 7471 methods, from which we generate the demystification reports. Our manual examination confirms that the extracted information in the generated demystification reports are of high accuracy. By a user study of 14 developers on 8 API-misuse related error scenarios, we show that our demystification reports help developer understand and debug API-misuse related program errors faster and more accurately, compared with reading only plain API usage-directive sentences.","1558-1225","978-1-4503-7121-6","","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2018YFB1003904); NSFC(grant numbers:61972339); Australian Research Council(grant numbers:DE200100021); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9283947","API usage directive;API misuse;Stack Overflow;Open information extraction","Text mining;Natural languages;Documentation;Manuals;Information retrieval;Software engineering;Message systems","","2","","33","","21 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However they are usually difficult to be used directly because most code snippets not only are syntactically incomplete but also lack dependency information, and thus do not compile. For example, Java snippets usually do not have import statements or required library names; only 6.88% of Java snippets on Stack Overflow include import statements necessary for compilation. This paper proposes SnR, a precise, efficient, constraint-based technique to automatically infer the exact types used in code snippets and the libraries containing the inferred types, to compile and therefore reuse the code snippets. Initially, SnR builds a knowledge base of APIs, i.e., various facts about the available APIs, from a corpus of Java libraries. Given a code snippet with missing import statements, SnR automatically extracts typing constraints from the snippet, solves the constraints against the knowledge base, and returns a set of APIs that satisfies the constraints to be imported into the snippet. We have evaluated SnR on a benchmark of 267 code snippets from Stack Overflow. SnR significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art tool Coster. SnR correctly infers 91.0% of the import statements, which makes 73.8% of the snippets compile, compared to 36.0% of the import statements and 9.0% of the snippets by Coster.","1558-1225","978-1-4503-9221-1","10.1145/3510003.3510061","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9794034","type inference;constraint satisfaction;automated repair;datalog","Productivity;Java;Codes;Knowledge based systems;Transforms;Benchmark testing;Maintenance engineering","","2","","44","","20 Jun 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Generally speaking, the process of finding vulnerabilities needs to apply fuzzing and symbolic execution techniques. Existing AEG generally targets executables for regular Linux and Windows platforms, but no AEG for vulnerable Internet of Things (IoT) devices. In response to this situation, we propose the exploit generation system IoTAEG, which automatically detects stack overflow vulnerabilities in the firmware of IoT devices, and automatically generates and exploits the generation system based on the stack overflow vulnerabilities. IoTAEG uses the mature fuzzing software AFL++ to detect vulnerabilities in IoT devices, uses the crashed input found by AFL++ to construct a symbolic state through symbolic execution, dynamically analyzes the constructed symbolic state, and detects whether there are exploitable vulnerabilities. If the above vulnerabilities exist, different exploit generation strategies will be adopted for different protection mechanisms, and some protection mechanisms such as Address space layout randomization (ASLR) and Non-eXecute (NX) will be bypassed. For some difficult-to-exploit cases, IoTAEG uses advanced stack overflow exploitation methods to generate exploits. Experiments show that IoTAEG can complete 20 MIPS/ARM binary files and 8 IoT devices’ firmware vulnerability detection and exploit generation. IoTAEG is the first publicly available vulnerability mining and exploit generation system for IoT devices.","","979-8-3503-0887-7","10.1109/ICCEIC60201.2023.10426628","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10426628","automatic exploit generation;stack overflow vulnerability;fuzzing;symbolic execution;Internet of Things","Linux;Computer architecture;Fuzzing;Computer crashes;Software;Internet of Things;Microprogramming","","1","","32","IEEE","13 Feb 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The present paper considers these issues by correlating week-by-week value changes in contribution unevenness, elite resilience (stickiness), and content quality. The goal is to detect if and how changes in social structural variables may influence the quality of the knowledge produced by online knowledge production sites. The paper addresses such question by an extensive data analysis carried out on the datasets of two representative sites: Wikipedia and Stack Overflow. Results from the analysis show that on Stack Overflow both unevenness and elite stickiness have a curvilinear effect on quality. Quality is optimized at specific levels of elite stickiness and unevenness. At the same time, on Wikipedia, quality increases linearly with a decline on entropy, overall, and with an increase in stickiness in the maturation phase, after an entropy peak is reached.","2473-991X","978-1-4503-4993-2","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9069088","Wikipedia;Stack Overflow;Unevenness;Elite Stickiness;Quality of Content","Production;Encyclopedias;Electronic publishing;Internet;Entropy;Collaboration","","","","30","","16 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Given the dynamic nature of scientific research, it has become important to incorporate new and popular scientific terminologies in document annotations. For this purpose, we have used crowd-source knowledge bases like Wikipedia and WikiCFP (a open source information source for call for papers) for automating key phrase generation. Also, we have taken into account the lack of availability of the document's content (due to protective policies) and developed a global context based key-phrase identification approach. We show that given only the title of a document, the proposed approach generates its global context information using academic search engines like Google Scholar. We evaluated the performance of the proposed approach on real-world dataset obtained from a computer science research document corpus. We quantitatively evaluated the performance of the proposed approach and compared it with two baseline approaches.","","978-0-7695-5145-6","10.1109/WI-IAT.2013.30","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6690015","document summarization;Wikipedia;Google Scholar;global context","Context;Encyclopedias;Electronic publishing;Internet;Databases;Google","","2","1","16","IEEE","23 Dec 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Since failing to locate relevant information may lead developers to incorrect or incomplete solutions, many approaches attempt to automatically extract relevant information from natural language artifacts. However, existing approaches are able to identify relevant text only for certain types of tasks and artifacts. To explore how these limitations could be relaxed, we conducted a controlled experiment in which we asked 20 software developers to examine 20 natural language artifacts consisting of 1,874 sentences and highlight the text they considered relevant to six software development tasks. Although the 2,463 distinct highlights participants created indicate variability in the perceived relevance of the text, the information considered key to completing the tasks was consistent. We observe consistency in the text using frame semantics, an approach that captures the key meaning of sentences, suggesting that frame semantics can be used in the future to automatically identify task-relevant information in natural language artifacts.","2576-3148","978-1-7281-5619-4","10.1109/ICSME46990.2020.00052","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9240640","Empirical Software Engineering;Information Foraging;Developer Productivity;Empirical Study","Software maintenance;Natural languages;Semantics;Tools;Software;Data mining;Task analysis","","5","","76","IEEE","2 Nov 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Thus, a time series investigation on the spread of such codes has not been conducted. In this paper, a method that enables the time series analysis of copy&paste is proposed. By determining the copy&paste of snippets and applications, we can investigate the context in time series using time information such as the respective publication dates and time, and clarify how many cases are not copy&paste. Evaluation of the proposed method is achieved using large-scale data which includes 527,249 snippets and 249,987 applications. The result shows that the appearance rate of applications having the same code as the snippet has increased after the release of the snippet.
