The platform manages the system and encourages smartphone users to contribute to the crowdsourcing system. To enable such sensing system, incentive mechanisms are necessary to motivate users to share the sensing capabilities of their smartphones. In this paper, we propose ProMoT, which is a Profit Maximizing Truthful auction mechanism for mobile crowdsourcing systems. In the proposed auction mechanism, the platform acts as an auctioneer. The smartphone users act as the sellers and submit their bids to the platform. The platform selects a subset of smartphone users and assigns the tasks to them. ProMoT aims to maximize the profit of the platform while providing satisfying rewards to the smartphone users. ProMoT consists of a winner determination algorithm, which is an approximate but close-to-optimal algorithm based on a greedy mechanism, and a payment scheme, which determines the payment to users. Both are computationally efficient with polynomial time complexity. We prove that ProMoT motivates smartphone users to rationally participate and truthfully reveals their bids. Simulation results show that ProMoT increases the profit of the platform in comparison with an existing scheme.","1938-1883","978-1-4673-6432-4","10.1109/ICC.2015.7248819","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7248819","","Smart phones;Sensors;Mobile communication;Crowdsourcing;Mobile computing;Approximation algorithms;Polynomials","","26","","17","IEEE","10 Sep 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

S2aaS can provide crowdsourced data to an application running on a cloud platform. The crowdsourced data can be used for several purposes such as public safety. One of the biggest challenges here is the incentive mechanisms for the users who are requested to provide S2aaS. In this paper, we propose mobility-aware trustworthy crowdsourcing (MATCS) framework in a cloud-centric IoT architecture which adopts and extends a previous scheme, Trustworthy Sensing for Crowd Management (TSCM) [1] by incorporating user mobility-awareness in the presence of maliciously altered sensing data. MATCS employs a user-centric incentive mechanism which collects sensing data based on an auction procedure. In the auction procedure, MATCS uses users' reputations, bids, current location and their estimated dislocation during crowdsourcing process. Furthermore, in order to investigate the benefits of reputation-awareness, we also propose reputation-unaware Mobility-Aware Crowdsourcing (MACS). Performance of MATCS is evaluated via simulations, and it is compared to MACS and a benchmark scheme, which aims at making a compromise between the utilities of the users and the platform by considering neither mobility nor trustworthiness. Simulation results confirm that mobility-awareness improves the utility of the platform significantly whereas combining reputation-awareness and mobility-awareness by MATCS can triple the improvement. Besides, user incomes are not significantly impacted by MACS or MATCS when users are mobile. Furthermore, maliciously altered data ratio can be degraded by 20%~55% by reputation-awareness in MATCS.","1530-1346","978-1-4799-4277-0","10.1109/ISCC.2014.6912581","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6912581","Auction theory;cloud computing;crowd management;public safety;Sensing-as-a-Service (S2aaS);smart phone sensing","Sensors;Cities and towns;Crowdsourcing;Safety;Social network services;Cloud computing;Computer architecture","","25","","15","IEEE","29 Sep 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, as one of the most important motivating factors for on line crowdsourcing workers, it is more important for the task requesters to not only be able to estimate ""what the nominal price should be?"" for their tasks, but also to justify ""what the strategic price should be?"" in order to incentivize broader worker participation as well as higher quality of final submissions. Goal: To address the above questions, this paper reports an empirical study to develop further understanding about the relationship between tasks award and associated worker behaviors. Method: We develop a conceptual award-behavior model, formulate a set of research questions about the relationships of award and worker's behavior and performance, and conduct 4 empirical studies on 514 crowdsourcing tasks extracted from TopCoder platform. Results: Major results include: (1) in general, negative correlations between award and worker behavior metrics; (2) a decreasing tendency in making submission as the number of registrants increases; (3) a weak positive correlation of 0.19 between number of registrants and score of the winning submission; and (4) for similar tasks, the relationship of award on worker behavior follows a variety of inverted U-shape curves. Conclusions: We believe the preliminary findings are helpful for task requesters in better task planning, and hope to stimulate further discussions and research in strategic crowd coordination.","1949-3789","978-1-4673-7899-4","10.1109/ESEM.2015.7321192","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7321192","","Decision support systems;Indexes","","20","","23","IEEE","9 Nov 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, these mechanisms usually impose additional work overhead for the worker, e.g. by adding test questions, or increase the costs for the employer, e.g. by replicating the task for majority decisions. In this work, we analyze the applicability of implicit measurements to objectively estimate the quality of the workers' results. First efforts in this area have already been made by investigating the impact of the task completion time. We extend this research by deploying an application layer monitoring (ALM), which enables monitoring the workers' interactions with our task interface on a much more detailed level. Based on an exemplary use case, we discuss a possible implementation and demonstrate the potential of the approach by predicting the quality of the workers' submission based on our monitoring results. This ALM provides a new way to identify low quality work as well as difficulties in fulfilling the formulated tasks in the domain of Crowdsourcing.","","978-1-4799-5051-5","10.1109/CCE.2014.6916756","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6916756","","Monitoring;Irrigation;Switches","","20","","14","IEEE","7 Oct 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A significant challenge facing these systems is determining the most efficient allocation of tasks to workers to achieve successful completion of the tasks under real-time constraints. This paper presents REACT, a crowdsourcing system that seeks to address this challenge and proposes algorithms that aim to stimulate user participation and handle dynamic task assignment and execution in the crowdsourcing system. The goal is to determine the most appropriate workers to assign incoming tasks, in such a way so that the realtime demands are met and high quality results are returned.

With spatial crowdsourcing, the goal is to outsource a set of spatiotemporal tasks (i.e., tasks with time and location) to a set of workers, which requires the workers to be physically present at the location of the tasks in order to perform them. Research efforts have focused on different aspects of SC, such as task assignment, task scheduling and protecting workers' privacy. However, one of the biggest challenges for the research community is the absence of public real-world datasets from SC applications such as Uber, TaskRabbit, etc. Therefore, we propose a synthetic workload generator for the SC applications, namely SCAWG1, to produce common datasets for experimentation, thus leading to reproducible research. SCAWG facilitates and standardizes workload generation in SC research. Specifically, SCAWG considers realistic spatiotemporal properties and behaviors for both workers and tasks. In addition, to further emulate the real-world workloads, it considers various application-specific constraints and properties of workers and tasks as well as their temporal arrival patterns. SCAWG is very flexible and thus can be customized for different spatial crowdsourcing and crowdsensing applications via a set of user-defined parameters and distributions. We developed an open-source toolbox2 to demonstrate the feasibility and applicability of SCAWG. The toolbox is designed to be generic and extensible, which would expedite experimental studies.","","978-1-5090-1941-0","10.1109/PERCOMW.2016.7457121","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7457121","Spatial Crowdsourcing;Mobile Crowdsensing;Datasets;User Mobility","Generators;Crowdsourcing;Graphical models;Distribution functions;Mobile handsets;Spatiotemporal phenomena;Sensors","","18","","22","IEEE","21 Apr 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Quality control is a key design objective in incentive mechanisms for crowdsourcing as requesters aim at obtaining answers of high quality under a given budget. However, when measuring workers' long-term quality, existing mechanisms either fail to utilize workers' historical information, or treat workers' quality as stable and ignore its temporal characteristics, hence performing poorly in a long run. In this paper we propose MELODY, a long-term dynamic quality-aware incentive mechanism for crowdsourcing. MELODY models interaction between requesters and workers as reverse auctions that run continuously. In each run of MELODY, we design a truthful, individual rational, budget feasible and quality-aware algorithm for task allocation with polynomial-time computation complexity and O(1) performance ratio. Moreover, taking into consideration the long-term characteristics of workers' quality, we propose a novel framework in MELODY for quality inference and parameters learning based on Linear Dynamical Systems at the end of each run, which takes full advantage of workers' historical information and predicts their quality accurately. Through extensive simulations, we demonstrate that MELODY outperforms existing work in terms of both quality estimation (reducing estimation error by 17.6% ~ 24.2%) and social performance (increasing requester's utility by 18.2% ~ 46.6%) in long-term scenarios.","1063-6927","978-1-5386-1792-2","10.1109/ICDCS.2017.28","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7980035","","Crowdsourcing;Resource management;Heuristic algorithms;Inference algorithms;Quality control;Estimation;Mechanical factors","","16","","31","IEEE","17 Jul 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A suitable worker is the one who has a high probability of submitting a correct answer for the published HIT. However, there are four problems that make the existing methods be less effective in recommending suitable workers. First, on most of crowdsourcing platforms, the great majority of workers have good reputations and thus are regarded as homogenous workers who have equal opportunities to be recommended. Secondly, dishonest workers may gain recommendations by counterfeiting good reputations and overstating personal skills. Moreover, the classical data sparsity and cold start problems co-exist in crowdsourcing environments. To effectively differentiate homogenous workers, we firstlycalculate a worker's performance in different types of HITspublished by different requesters. Aiming to improve the accuracy of predicting a worker's performance, we propose a metric which separately considers two requesters' similarities in transacting with the common workers they trust and in transacting with the common workers they distrust. Afterwards, targeting dishonest behaviours, we propose a transaction-based trust model. Targeting the data sparsity problem, we propose a new trust sub-network extraction algorithm (TSE) to discover more requesters who can provide trustworthy opinions for generating recommendations. Furthermore, we propose two strategiesfor solving the cold start problem. Finally, by incorporatingthe similarity metric, the new trust model, the new trustsub-network extraction algorithm and the new strategies, wepropose a novel trust-aware worker recommendation methodCrowdRec.

We first formulate the task assignment as a many-to-one matching problem, in which multiple workers are assigned to a task, and the task can be successfully completed only if a minimum quality requirement can be satisfied within its limited budget. Different from traditional task assignment mechanisms which focus on utility maximization for the crowdsourcing platform, our proposed matching framework takes into consideration the preferences of individual crowdsourcers and workers towards each other. We design a novel algorithm that can generate a stable outcome for the many-to-one matching problem with lower and upper bounds (i.e., quality requirement and budget constraint), as well as heterogeneous worker skill levels.

We discover that the empirical entropy of workers' results, which measures the uncertainty in the final aggregated results, naturally becomes a suitable metric to evaluate the outcome of crowdsourcing tasks. Therefore, this paper designs a worker selection mechanism that minimizes the empirical entropy of the results submitted by participating workers. Specifically, we formulate worker selection under sequentially arriving tasks as a combinatorial multi-armed bandit problem, which treats each worker as an arm, and aims at learning the best combination of arms that minimize the cumulative empirical entropy. By information theoretic methods, we carefully derive an estimation of the upper confidence bound for empirical entropy minimization, and leverage it in our minimum entropy upper confidence bound (ME-UCB) algorithm to balance exploration and exploitation. Theoretically, we prove that ME-UCB has a regret upper bound of O(1), which surpasses existing submodular UCB algorithms.

One of the challenges of LDP perturbation is the sparsity of worker answers (i.e., each worker only answers a small number of tasks). Simple extension of existing approaches (e.g., Laplace perturbation and randomized response) may incur large errors in truth inference on sparse data. Thus we design a new matrix factorization (MF) algorithm under LDP that addresses the trade-off between privacy and utility (i.e., accuracy of truth inference). We prove that our MF algorithm can provide both LDP guarantee and small error of truth inference, regardless of the sparsity of worker answers. We perform extensive experiments on real-world and synthetic datasets and demonstrate that the MF algorithm performs better than the existing LDP algorithms on sparse crowdsourcing data.","","978-1-5386-5035-6","10.1109/BigData.2018.8622635","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8622635","","Task analysis;Crowdsourcing;Privacy;Inference algorithms;Differential privacy;Perturbation methods","","12","","51","IEEE","24 Jan 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Answers and Amazon Mechanical Turk) provide a platform for requesters, who have tasks to solve, to ask for help from workers. Vital to the proliferation of crowdsourcing systems is incentivizing the workers to exert high effort to provide high-quality services. Reputation mechanisms have been shown to work effectively as incentive schemes in crowdsourcing systems. A reputation agency updates the reputations of the workers based on the requesters' reports on the quality of the workers' services. A low-reputation worker is less likely to get served when it requests help, which provides incentives for the workers to obtain a high reputation by exerting high effort. However, reputation update errors are inevitable, because of either system errors such as loss of reports, or inaccurate reports, resulting from the difficulty in accurately assessing the quality of a worker's service. The reputation update error prevents existing reputation mechanisms from achieving the social optimum. In this paper, we propose a simple binary reputation mechanism, which has only two reputation labels (“good” and “bad”). To the best of our knowledge, our proposed reputation mechanism is the first that is proven to be able to achieve the social optimum even in the presence of reputation update errors. We provide design guidelines for socially-optimal binary reputation mechanisms.","2379-190X","978-1-4799-0356-6","10.1109/ICASSP.2013.6638667","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6638667","crowdsourcing;reputation;game theory","Games;Markov processes;IP networks;Servers;History;Joints;Error probability","","12","","13","IEEE","21 Oct 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For spatial crowdsourcing to scale to millions of workers and tasks, it should be able to efficiently assign tasks to workers, which in turn consists of both matching tasks to workers and computing a schedule for each worker. The current approaches for task assignment in spatial crowdsourcing cannot scale as either task matching or task scheduling will become a bottleneck. Instead, we propose an on-line assignment approach utilizing an auction-based framework where workers bid on every arriving task and the server determines the highest bidder, resulting in splitting the assignment responsibility between workers (for scheduling) and the server (for matching) and thus eliminating all bottlenecks. Through several experiments on both real-world and synthetic datasets, we compare the accuracy and efficiency of our real-time algorithm with state of the art algorithms proposed for similar problems. We show how other algorithms cannot generate as good of an assignment because they fail to manage the dynamism and/or take advantage of the spatiotemporal characteristics of SC.","","978-1-5386-2715-0","10.1109/BigData.2017.8257951","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8257951","","Schedules;Crowdsourcing;Servers;Real-time systems;Scheduling;Complexity theory","","12","","15","IEEE","15 Jan 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Furthermore, we consider the crowdsourcing scenario where the contribution model is submodular and time-sensitive, which is more realistic compared to the linear summation model adopted by previous works. Under this model, we design a reward mechanism based on the incentive tree, and prove that this mechanism satisfies several economic properties such as continuing contribution incentive, continuing solicitation incentive, θ-reward proportional to contribution, early contribution incentive, and sybil-proofness.

In order to address this issue, the crowdsourcing approach has been adopted, according to which the fingerprints are frequently updated in the respective database via user reporting.

However, what hiding behind the strategies are solutions to motivate users for participation, which reveals a fundamental problem: the fairness issue of crowdsourcing system. Since the participators are human beings with intensive interest for obtaining benefits, it is reasonable to build a sustainable crowd with guaranteed fairness among users. Thus in this study, we investigate the fairness issue in mobile social network, which could be more complicated when uncontrollable mobile users are concerned. The intuitive solution is, if the tasks could be effectively assigned among users in a balanced way, the fairness could be guaranteed. Unfortunately, there is still a big challenge for this issue, because it's difficult to acquire accurate global information of task loading, which is highly dynamic and distributed. By leveraging the power of two random choices, which is based on the balls and bins theory, we develop a lightweight scheme to allocate tasks. Indeed, we proposed a heuristic algorithm to achieve balanced task allocation effectively with O(1) complexity. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first effort for incorporating fair load balancing in pure distributed mobile crowdsourcing systems. Our extensive evaluation results validate our task offloading algorithm, showing that the proposed scheme outperforms the random choice method.","","978-1-5090-0329-7","10.1109/MSN.2015.32","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7420952","Fairness;Balanced Task Offloading;Mobile Social Network","Mobile communication;Resource management;Crowdsourcing;Mobile computing;Indexes;Social network services;Algorithm design and analysis","","8","","27","IEEE","29 Feb 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This leads to serious issues including reduced diversity of sensing devices and starvation of some users.

First, a beta reputation system is adopted for probabilistic reliability assessment according to vehicles' behavior. Then, a new multi-dimensional task assignment problem, which proves to be NP-complete, is modeled as a many-to-one matching game between the platform and vehicles by defining reliability and reward-based preference functions. Finally, a distributed matching algorithm that aims at maximizing the platform reward by assigning the tasks to reliable participants is presented.

To guarantee the quality of crowdsourcing service, it is necessary to select the most appropriate task workers to complete the tasks. To this end, the crowdsourcing platform (broker) must conduct the mutual matching between tasks and workers based on the task requirements and worker preferences. However, both task requirements and worker preferences may contain sensitive information (e.g., time, location of the task, etc.), which should not be revealed to the broker and other adversaries. In this paper, we propose a secure and efficient task matching scheme to enable the broker to conduct the mutual matching between tasks and workers, according to task requirements and worker preferences with multiple keywords, while preserving the privacy of keywords contained in task requirements and worker preferences.

A fine-grained COVID-19 vulnerability map will be essential to track the number of people with covid-like symptoms, so that the the potential outbreak communities can be identified and the valuable healthcare resources can proactively and dynamically be allocated. Mobile crowdsourcing based symptom reporting is a promising and convenient option to construct such a map, while it may compromise the location privacy of crowdsourcing participants. In this work, we propose a novel approach to establish the COVID-19 vulnerability map based on the crowdsourced reporting without disclosing the participants' location privacy to a semi-honest crowdsourcing aggregator. Briefly, based on the differentially private geo-indistinguishability, the mobile participants are able to locally perturb their geographic data. With the masked geographic information, we employ the best linear unbiased prediction estimator with spatial smoothing to obtain the reliable vulnerability estimates in the areas of interest and construct the map. Given the fast spreading nature of coronavirus, we integrate the vulnerability estimates with a susceptible-exposed-infected-removed (SEIR) model to build up a future trend map.

This new concept is evolving in many fields ranging from world mapping, health monitoring, disaster relief to crime prevention. Many studies have shown that crowdsourcing serves as a promising new approach in gathering information. Success stories by Google, OpenStreetMap, and Wikimapia inspired organizations including local authorities to try this new method for their own use. In this paper, we evaluate 6 mobile applications which use crowdsourcing to report crime related incidents. The evaluation is done based on 7 criteria that are found to be important based on literatures.

In this paper, we propose an anomalous path detection (APD) scheme to classify attackers according to their reputation management and abnormal trajectory sequence. Specifically, we first develop a crowdsourcing system to support the indoor location service using the fog as the spatial crowdsourcing server. Then, we identify two levels of attackers, i.e., the malicious responders and the semi-honest responders in the indoor environment according to their attacking purposes. Through the responders' historical records from the fog server, we analyze a series of trajectory sequences consisting of the distance between the current position and the destination to distinguish the semi-honest responders from the normal. In addition, we propose a semi-supervised learning with hidden Markov model (HMM) to detect the semi-honest responders.

However, the unreliability of the participant behaviors puts a barrier in the wide adoption of these platforms. Although many works exist to detect unreliable observers in rating experiments, there is still a lack of methodology for detecting unreliable observers in quality evaluation of multimedia content using pairwise comparison. In this work, we propose methods to identify irregular annotator behaviors in pairwise comparison paradigm. We compare the proposed methods’ efficiency for two scenarios: quality evaluation of traditional 2D images and 3D interactive multimedia. We conducted two crowdsourcing experiments for two different Quality of Experience assessment tasks and inserted carefully designed synthetic spammer profiles to evaluate the proposed tools. Our results suggest that the detection of unreliable observers is highly task-dependent. The influence of the spammer behavior intensity and the proportion of spammers among the observers can be more severe on tasks with higher subjectivity. Based on these findings, we provide guidelines and recommendations towards developing spammer detection algorithms for subjective pairwise quality evaluation of multimedia content.","","978-1-6654-4989-2","10.1109/ICMEW53276.2021.9455992","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9455992","Spammer detection;Pairwise comparison;Crowdsourcing.","Crowdsourcing;Three-dimensional displays;Observers;Tools;Market research;Quality of experience;Task analysis","","5","","17","IEEE","21 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The validity of the data gathered in a disturbed environment is questionable, especially in speech quality assessment and other audio-related tasks. This work presents the results of a simulated crowdsourcing study conducted in the laboratory. We investigate the influence of environmental background noise in speech quality assessment tests. Three groups of listeners were recruited to rate the quality of speech files under the influence of background noise at different levels. Two types of noise were tested, i.e., street noises and TV-Show. Our findings suggest that the threshold at which an environmental background noise would significantly affect the speech quality ratings in crowdsourcing is between 43dB(A) and 50dB(A). Additionally, listeners tolerated more the TV-Show noise. They provided more accurate ratings while conducting the test under the influence of higher levels of the TV-Show noise, than at lower levels of the street noise.

They allow requesters to quickly find workers to complete small tasks and workers to undertake pieces of work for self-fulfillment. The current crowdsourcing models do the task assignment either from the requester's side (server assigned task mode) or the worker's side (worker selected task mode). The satisfaction of both sides is not fully considered. Furthermore, there is a lack of tools to help them make decisions based on complex information and their preferences. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a new crowdsourcing platform that takes the satisfaction of both the requesters and workers into account so as to improve the quality of the platform. We adopt Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) to automatically generate preference lists for both parties that best reflect their interests. We propose a stable matching (SM) algorithm to pair the workers and tasks according to their preference lists. Simulation results show that our platform has higher satisfaction scores than the existing ones and the one that uses random assignment.","","978-1-6654-3927-5","10.1109/BigDataSecurityHPSCIDS52275.2021.00047","NSF(grant numbers:1757893); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9463551","analytic hierarchy process;crowdsourcing;preference list;stable matching;task assignment","Crowdsourcing;Conferences;Simulation;Analytic hierarchy process;Switches;Tools;Data models","","3","","20","IEEE","29 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, ratings are not made by experts, are subjective, and require user involvement; therefore, a large number of reviews are needed before the ratings become statistically reliable. One way to obtain user input transparently is to collect data from devices through crowdsourcing. In this work, we present CrowdApp, a crowdsourcing-based application that continuously runs in the background and collects data from the device without any active user participation (transparent crowdsourcing). Then it computes a score for every app installed on the device. The application was tested on Android. Our results show that there is a high correlation (> 0.8) between CrowdApp scores and Google Play scores.

Recent pieces of literature focus on the multi-task allocation for mobile crowdsourcing, considering improving the accuracy of the collected data by inferring and utilizing the reliability of users. However, they neglect the fact that the internal dependency relationship exists on sub-tasks, which is decomposed via a divide-and-conquer method from the source tasks. Neglecting this fact may cause a series of dilemmas including high latency, low quality, low execution rate, and even more allocation errors. To address these problems, we should renormalize the task allocation problem of mobile crowdsourcing, and the task is divided into logically dependent sub-tasks, and then sub-tasks are sorted by the Depth-first search (DFS) algorithm. Different from previous approaches, an allocation method SGTA considering task internal dependencies is introduced to ensure that the workload does not exceed the executive ability of each worker and try to avoid misallocation. Based on the submission report during task execution, we devise a SimilAr Task Dynamic (SATD) allocation method to dynamically re-allocate these failure tasks. Finally, experimental results based on both synthetic and real data sets demonstrate that the proposed method is effective.","","978-1-7281-4034-6","10.1109/SmartWorld-UIC-ATC-SCALCOM-IOP-SCI.2019.00171","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9060120","Crowdsourcing;dynamic task assignment;task dependency;complex task;sub-task","Task analysis;Resource management;Crowdsourcing;Dynamic scheduling;Delays;Mobile handsets;Sorting","","3","","23","IEEE","9 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Compared to federated learning (FL), clients can dynamically collect and label fresh data as required, and train model on the updated data. Existing research has mainly focused on incentivizing clients to spend more effort on data collection and labelling in order to improve FL model performance. However, as data collection and labeling require human effort, they need to balance work and rest. This need has been overlooked by existing federated crowdsourcing research. In this paper, we propose the Federated Workforce Management (FedWM) approach to bridge this important gap. It first measures the contribution of each client to the FL model, and estimates the urgency collecting new labelled data based on the rate of change of the contribution. Then, FedWM computes the working time taking into account of the client’s maximum productivity and self-reported mood. Finally, it takes both the urgency level of obtaining new data and clients’ productivity into consideration to provide scheduling services that advise the clients on work-rest balance in a given time slot based on Lyapunov optimization. Through theoretical analysis, we provide the performance bounds of FedWM. Through extensive experiments based on real-world datasets, we demonstrate that FedWM achieves significantly more advantageous tradeoffs between client rest and FL model performance compared to existing approaches. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first federated crowdsourcing framework designed to achieve productive laziness.","2836-3868","979-8-3503-0485-5","10.1109/ICWS60048.2023.00034","Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; National Research Foundation Singapore; Nanyang Technological University; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10248239","Federated Crowdsourcing;Workforce management service;Lyapunov optimization;Dynamic scheduling;Data collection","Crowdsourcing;Productivity;Schedules;Web services;Processor scheduling;Mood;Data collection","","3","","38","IEEE","19 Sep 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this work, we compare such a traditional approach with a different one, where the data used for predicting the users QoE is gathered directly at the network access, using Key Performance Indicators (KPI) available on each base station. Although such KPIs are aggregated by design (i.e., they refer to the distribution of a population of users rather than to a single individual), we show through experiments with a country-wide dataset that their predictive power is comparable and in some cases superior than the one of crowdsourcing. Such a result is particularly attractive for MNOs, since network KPIs are generally much easily obtainable than crowdsourcing data.","1558-2612","978-1-7281-9505-6","10.1109/WCNC49053.2021.9417464","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9417464","QoE prediction;Mobile Cellular Network;Network Intelligence","Crowdsourcing;Cellular networks;Base stations;Conferences;Key performance indicator;Sociology;Quality of experience","","2","","13","IEEE","5 May 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To address these issues, we present VideoMec, a video crowdsourcing system that automatically generates video descriptions based on various geographical and geometrical information, called metadata, from multiple embedded sensors in off-the-shelf mobile devices. With VideoMec, only a small amount of metadata needs to be uploaded to the server, hence reducing the bandwidth and energy consumption of mobile devices. Based on the uploaded metadata, VideoMec supports comprehensive queries for applications to find and fetch desired videos. For time-sensitive applications, it may not be possible to upload all desired videos in time due to limited wireless bandwidth and large video files. Thus, we formalize two optimization problems and propose efficient algorithms to select the most important videos to upload under bandwidth and time constraints. We have implemented a prototype of VideoMec, evaluated its performance, and demonstrated its effectiveness based on real experiments.","","978-1-4503-4890-4","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7944786","mobile video;metadata;crowdsourcing;video query;video selection","Videos;Metadata;Mobile communication;Cameras;Mobile handsets;Servers;Bandwidth","","2","","40","","12 Jun 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In mobile edge computing, the computation task needs to be dynamically migrated between multiple service nodes in order to maintain service continuity. But a service node is either an edge server or a mobile device in mobile crowdsourcing, which makes task migration more complex. In this paper, we propose a deep reinforcement learning-based task migration strategy for mobile crowdsourcing systems with the goal of meeting the task deadline requirement and minimizing the average cost of task completion. The proposed strategy firstly applies the long short-term memory (LSTM) network to predict the future movement of mobile devices and then utilizes a hybrid algorithm based on asynchronous deep Q-learning (ADQN) and ant colony optimization (ACO) to generate the optimal task migration strategy. The proposed strategy is evaluated by a simulation process.

In this paper, we design a decentralized mechanism for a Crowd of Crowdsourcing platforms, denoted as Crowd2, optimizing the worker selection to maximize the social welfare of these platforms in a long-term scope, under the consideration of both proportional fairness and dynamic flexibility. Concretely, we propose a video analytics dispatch algorithm based on multi-agent bandit, for which the more accurate profit estimates are attained via the decoupling of multi-knapsack based mapping problem. Via rigorous proofs, a sub-linear regret bound for social welfare of crowdsourcing profits is achieved while both fairness and flexibility are ensured. Extensive trace-driven experiments demonstrate that Crowd2 improves the social welfare by 36.8%, compared with other alternatives.","2641-9874","979-8-3503-3414-2","10.1109/INFOCOM53939.2023.10228927","Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10228927","","Crowdsourcing;Energy consumption;Uncertainty;Visual analytics;Heuristic algorithms;Dispatching;Outsourcing","","2","","52","IEEE","29 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Since culture belongs to all humans, it can be said that all humans have CH objects or knowledge or experiences that can be shared and collected so that they can be studied, utilized, and developed by the wider community. Recently, it has been known one method called crowdsourcing, which can reach large numbers of people through an internet connection and successfully doing projects together. With these characteristics, crowdsourcing can be used to collect Indonesian CH (ICH) data from people throughout Indonesia and even around the world, who store objects, knowledge, and experiences related to ICH. One important aspect of building a crowdsourcing system is task design. Good tasks are ones that can attract the crowd to participate. Many techniques and methods have been offered by researchers to create a successful task. In this ICH data collection system, 2 goals must be achieved: the collection of data and at the same time the data is organized so that it can be easily retrieved. Besides these 2 goals, the task design must also consider that the available crowd has different backgrounds, such as age, education level, expertise, and digital literacy level. This paper focuses on designing tasks for ICH data collection. Tasks are produced by following a five-step methodology, from identifying the data that has to be collected until designing the workflow of each task. The result is the contribute-edit-verify tasks, grouping based on the complexity of the tasks and the skills required by the task or the skills possessed by the crowd. Both methodology and a contribute-edit-verify group of task can also be applied to other domains that require data collection such as flora and fauna data collection, health data collection for disease management, education data collection, etc.","","978-1-7281-8047-2","10.1109/ICIC50835.2020.9288606","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9288606","crowdsourcing;data collecting;task design;cultural heritage","Crowdsourcing;Education;Tourism industry;Data collection;Cultural differences;Task analysis;Informatics","","2","","16","IEEE","24 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The knowledge about service requirements, client experience and delivery quality is in collective possession of different communities, such as clients, service designers and delivery teams. Current practices to discovering this distributed and unstructured knowledge are semi-automated, and as such they fail to scale and provide accurate insights on demand. Enterprise crowdsourcing provides a mechanism to harness the tacit knowledge from a large group of network-connected humans. In this paper we describe a novel approach to improving operational excellence, with focus on compliance posture, using enterprise crowdsourcing.

For the improvement of quality of service (QoS) in spatial crowdsourcing platforms, existing works usually adopt the many-to-one strategy - assigning multiple workers as a team for each published task. However, such an allocation scheme fails to consider team characteristics which can strongly affect the QoS for some experience-sensitive collaborative tasks. In this paper, we jointly consider two team characteristics to further improve the QoS: Diversity, which is the union of experiences within a team and Affinity, which is how efficiently team members collaborate. Inspired by these two characteristics, we study an important problem, namely, Affinitive Diversity-Aware Spatial Crowdsourcing (ADA-SC), which aims to find an allocation scheme, such that each team satisfies the affinity requirement of the corresponding task and maximizes the team diversity under budget and spatial constraints. Since ADA-SC is proven to be NP-hard by reduction from the set cover problem with nonlinear constraints, we propose two submodular approximation algorithms with pruning strategies for two single-task scenarios. Then a greedy-based algorithm is designed for the multi-task scenario.

It enables analytics and knowledge generation to occur at the source of the data. In this paper we present the amalgamation of three paradigms, each at different level of system development. Precept is a design paradigm for modeling complex control structures of the activities. It is a declaratively modeled control component that prohibits undesired couplings that are otherwise unavoidable in imperatively programmed control components. Crowdsourcing for system integration harnesses the collective intelligence or knowledge base of crowd's wisdom when given the right set of conditions.

However, recent psychological studies have revealed that humans are often bounded rational with cognitive reasoning limits. In this paper, we present a first study regarding the impact of such worker bounded rationality in a crowdsourcing system, and characterize how the result obtained from this more practical assumption deviates from the fully rational benchmark. Specifically, we consider a simple two-stage crowdsourcing model, where a requester first determines the rewards for workers completing the tasks, and then workers make their task choices accordingly. First, we show that such a model is non-trivial to analyze even in the fully rational case, due to the integer constraints on workers' choices. Nevertheless, we are able to characterize the closed-form solution of the optimal rewards and Nash equilibrium with full rationality by exploiting the special structure of the problem formulation. Next, we focus on the more practical bounded rational model, and apply the cognitive hierarchy theory from behavioral economics in the modeling of workers' decisions. Comparing with the fully rational benchmark, we show that in practice the requester can receive a higher profit when considering the workers' bounded rationality, especially when the number of workers is large or the workers' average cognitive level is low. When the workers' average cognitive level is high enough, however, the practical bounded rational model converges to the benchmark fully rational model.","2576-6813","978-1-5386-4727-1","10.1109/GLOCOM.2018.8647377","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8647377","","Task analysis;Crowdsourcing;Games;Cognition;Benchmark testing;Optimization;Psychology","","1","","14","IEEE","21 Feb 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The traditional approaches that rely on professional equipment and expertise to collect indoor maps has limited the rapid development of indoor location-based services. Adopting low-cost crowdsourcing methods to construct and maintain indoor maps with various sensors integrated in smart phones by common users is a development trend of constructing indoor map. The existing crowdsourcing-based indoor topology construction methods mostly use the pedometer based PDR (Pedestrian Dead Reckoning) to infer user trajectories, which suffers from the problem of accumulated estimation errors. To reduce the error of pedestrian dead reckoning and improve the accuracy of the indoor topology construction, we propose a novel indoor topology construction algorithm based on the user closed trajectory fusion. The algorithm requires the user to start and end a trajectory loop at the same location when collecting data. Based on this trajectory loop, we can perform the forward and backward dead reckoning starting from the starting and the ending point of the path, respectively. For instance, after completing the forward path inference, we can swap the starting point with the ending point, and then perform the reverse path inference. Last, we aggregate the coordinates obtained from the forward and reverse path inferences with the different weight. The weight is defined to be proportional to the confidence of the PDR, i.e., inversely proportional to the walking time from the starting location of path inference. Compared to the traditional unidirectional trajectory inference method, our proposed algorithm can greatly reduce the accumulated error of dead reckoning by aggregating the bidirectional trajectory inference. To improve the accuracy of heading estimation of each step, we Ieverage a radial Gaussian function to filter the compass noise, and adopt the multi-strategy fusion mechanism based on the difference of direction estimation using the gyroscope and compass. The paper further introduces the external contour of the building to calibrate the direction of the indoor topological path, and improves the accuracy of the indoor topological path construction. The experimental results shows that our proposed crowdsourcing-based indoor topology construction algorithm using the bidirectional trajectory fusion scheme outperforms the traditional indoor topology construction algorithm that uses only the forward PDR and can obtain an average map accuracy of 0.40-meter.","","978-1-5386-3755-5","10.1109/UPINLBS.2018.8559717","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8559717","indoor localization;indoor map construction;dead reckoning;magnetic fmgerprint;crowd sourcing","Crowdsourcing;Dead reckoning;Transforms;Fingerprint recognition;Inference algorithms;Trajectory;Topology","","1","","30","IEEE","6 Dec 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, previous work did not fully consider the heterogeneous nature of tasks with both spatio-temporal and sensing requirements. And for the participants, they contribute different amounts and types of sensing data due to the fact that their devices usually have various sensing capabilities. In light of this, it is desired to study the task allocation problem in such a heterogeneous spatial crowdsourcing scenario. Specifically, to accommodate the dynamic and complex features of this scenario, we design a Multi-Agent Soft Actor-Critic algorithm (TA-DSAC) that relies on spatio-temporal con-straint. Firstly, we construct available task allocation regions according to the spatio-temporal characteristics of the tasks and participants, as well as the matching degree and aggregate sensing quality, and then set an agent for each region. Next, the agents are trained based on discretized Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) and Centralized Training with Decentralized Execution (CTDE), making the agents self-adaptive to changes in this crowdsourcing environment. Extensive evaluations with real datasets justify the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm.","2576-6813","978-1-6654-3540-6","10.1109/GLOBECOM48099.2022.10000860","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61960206008,62002294); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10000860","Heterogeneous spatial crowdsourcing;task allocation;multi-agent deep reinforcement learning","Crowdsourcing;Training;Heuristic algorithms;Aggregates;Reinforcement learning;Sensors;Resource management","","1","","21","IEEE","11 Jan 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper proposes a novel label quality improvement method based on ensemble TSK fuzzy classifier with high interpretability, i.e., EW-TSK-CS. Each subclassifier TSKnoise-FC is an improved zero-order TSK fuzzy classifier which is trained by noisy label training data and is more robust. The objective function of each fuzzy sub-classifier has considered the existence of label noise, and the fuzzy subclassifier has the ability to deal with uncertain data. All the subclassifier integrated together by augmenting the original noisy-free validation data space with the output of each subclassifier in an incremental way. The augmented validation data is conducted by running the classical FCM clustering methods on the augmented validation data and using KNN to obtain the dictionary data. The label noise correction mechanism is based on the dictionary data. The experimental results on datasets Adult, chess and waveform3 show that this method can effectively improve the label quality of crowdsourcing compared with tradition label noise robustness methods, ensemble methods, and classical TSK fuzzy classifiers.","","978-1-7281-2348-6","10.1109/ISKE47853.2019.9170348","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9170348","crowdsourcing;label quelity;ensemble TSK fuzzy classifier;interpretability","","","1","","32","IEEE","18 Aug 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, it naturally raises privacy concerns, as personal data needs to be collected and analyzed in the cloud, and results need to be sent back to the users to improve their local estimates. In this paper, we focus on the use of a specific type of learning algorithms, called maximum a posteriori (MAP) inference, in crowdsourcing systems, and use a crowdsourced localization system as an example. With MAP inference, the accuracy of each estimate of the user state may be improved by analyzing other users' estimates. Naturally, the privacy of the user state needs to be protected. Within the general framework of differential privacy, we show how private user states can be perturbed while preserving statistically accurate results. For the crowdsourcing system, we design a non-interactive mechanism for a group of users to perform inference without revealing their true states to any other party. The mechanism is implemented and verified in an indoor localization system. By comparing with the state-of-the-art, we have shown that our proposed privacy-preserving mechanism produces highly accurate results efficiently.","","978-1-5386-0683-4","10.1109/CNS.2017.8228623","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8228623","","Privacy;Crowdsourcing;Servers;Inference algorithms;Perturbation methods;Encryption","","1","","19","IEEE","21 Dec 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

During each epoch of iterations, we choose one sentence bag and repeat two steps: Firstly, attention based Long Short-Term Memory network is applied as a selector to discover potential UUs. Secondly, these UUs are annotated by crowdsourcing with two answer collecting strategies and fed back into selector as positive samples. Until the accuracy of selector reaches a threshold, all annotated samples are added into relation classifier as cleaned train set and framework moves on to next epoch with new sentence bags.

Although different crowdsourcing services have proposed different data fusing methods, we find that they may not fully leverage the data collected from multiple dimensions that can potentially lead to a better fusion result. In order to harness this opportunity, we propose a more general solution, which can fuse the multi-dimension crowdsourced data together and align them with the consistent time and location stamps by using the features of the sensory data only, and thus can provide a high-quality crowdsourcing service from the raw data samplings collected from the environment.

Under the malicious attack, the sensing data which should be transmitted to the platform may suffer from data loss, which reduces the users' utility and platform's utility. The data loss can also lead to the reduction of the users' participatory motivations because they are not able to earn expected money due to data loss. Therefore, the total sensing quality and the social welfare will be affected eventually. To solve this problem, in this paper, we propose a novel insurance-based framework to compensate the data loss due to security threat in mobile crowdsourcing systems.

Through high frequency probes, it is possible to visualize and characterize the anatomical layers, such as tissues, which can constitute a very helpful supporting tool in several procedures, e.g., surgeries. However, the visual identification of tissues in this type of image is still a challenge for some professionals. In this work, we evaluate deep learning (DL) segmentation algorithms for the tissue segmentation task in US. Moreover, we briefly assess whether their performance can be improved by including a crowdsourcing step. In order to perform the segmentation task, different segmentation models are trained, as posteriorly, the crowdsourcing step is included. The proposed approach is composed of the following steps: 1 - automatic segmentation using a deep learning algorithm; 2 - crowd evaluation and correction of the results. In order to perform step 1, different segmentation models are trained. The second step includes a visual interface where users can: a) validate the quality of the automatic segmentation; or b) correct the segmentation whether the DL result is inconsistent. All users are scored, denoting the quality of their annotations, considering the manual annotations provided by an expert for a small group of images. In order to evaluate the method and compare it to a DL algorithms alone, a total of 100 US images were used. Our experiments show that the inclusion of crowdsourcing significantly improved the performance of the tissue segmentation task compared to using the DL models alone.

The optimal mapping between volunteers and tasks with collaboration becomes challenging for complex tasks demanding greater skills and cognitive ability. Unlike traditional crowdsourcing, volunteers like to work on their own schedule and locations. To address this problem, we propose a novel two-phase frame-work consisting of Initial Volunteer-Task Mapping (i-VTM) and Adaptive Common Slot Finding (a-CSF) algorithms. The i-VTM algorithm assigns volunteers to the tasks based on their skills and spatial proximity, whereas the a-CSF algorithm recommends appropriate common working time slots for successful volunteer collaboration. Both the algorithms aim to maximise the overall utility of the crowdsourcing platform. Experimenting with the UpWork dataset demonstrates the efficacy of our framework over existing state-of-the-art methods.","2576-6813","978-1-6654-3540-6","10.1109/GLOBECOM48099.2022.10001191","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10001191","Crowdsourcing;Skill-based volunteering;Spa-tial task allocation;Collaboration;Common working time","Crowdsourcing;Schedules;Collaboration;Global communication;Task analysis","","","","19","IEEE","11 Jan 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Stigmergy in crowdsourcing consists of tracking changes in work activities to guide crowd workers based on the digital traces left by other workers. In such scenarios, there is no direct communication between the contributors. Still, the traceable changes they left during their actions act as a mediating element that clearly affects the final work product. From a behavior analysis perspective, the properties recorded in event logs can be of practical value in observing the behavioral traces produced by crowd workers when performing microtasks. This form of task fingerprinting has been explored for over a decade to better understand performance-related data and user navigational behavior in crowdsourcing markets. In line with this, the goal of this paper is to study the feasibility of task fingerprinting alongside the stigmergic effect occurring in a crowdsourcing setting through a user event logger. To this end, a case study was conducted using a real-world scenario of extreme weather phenomena represented on interactive maps. Each user could observe the traces of other crowd members while providing annotations. Twelve experts in weather forecasting were recruited to participate in this study to annotate extreme weather events. The results indicate that it is possible to use task fingerprinting for tracking the stigmergic effect in such activities with gains in terms of implicit coordination. Furthermore, the task fingerprinting allowed to map participants with similar behavioral traces, suggesting an increase in the accuracy of annotation clusters.","2768-1904","979-8-3503-3168-4","10.1109/CSCWD57460.2023.10152765","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10152765","Crowdsourcing;CSCW;Task Fingerprinting Stigmergy;Behavioral traces;User log interaction.","Crowdsourcing;Annotations;Navigation;Weather forecasting;Fingerprint recognition;Behavioral sciences;Task analysis","","","","44","IEEE","22 Jun 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

One potential application is to crowdsource photos/videos on demand to search for interested targets. Crowdsourced photos/videos have much better coverage compared to surveillance cameras, and thus help improve the effectiveness of target search. However, broadcasting the crowdsourcing task to all mobile users can significantly increase the cost in terms of resource and incentive budget. To reduce cost, the crowdsourcing server selects a subset of participating workers, and there are many challenges on worker selection. For example, due to occlusions in the photo/video scene, each worker only covers part of the area with certain probability. Due to the non-deterministic nature of this problem, we study two kinds of optimization problems: max-coverage which maximizes the probability of finding the target given a cost, and min-selection which minimizes the number of workers given the required probability of finding the target. Considering that workers may report exact locations or coarse-grained locations, we formalize four probability-based optimization problems for worker selection, and develop optimal or efficient approximation algorithms to solve them. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithms is evaluated and validated via extensive trace-driven simulations and a real-world demo.","2637-9430","978-1-6654-9726-8","10.1109/ICCCN54977.2022.9868898","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9868898","","Crowdsourcing;Costs;Surveillance;Approximation algorithms;Cameras;Real-time systems;Mobile handsets","","","","34","IEEE","5 Sep 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
