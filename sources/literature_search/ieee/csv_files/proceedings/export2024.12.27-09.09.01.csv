Ratio and shortest time distance methods were applied to calculate public service facility accessibility. By employing the rank correlation and spatial overlay methods, this study analyzed the mismatch between supply and demand of accessibility. We found that: The shopping and medical public service resources of Chengdu are highly concentrated in the first ring road, while the education public service resources are mostly located outside the third ring road. The utilization and distribution of the four types of public service facilities in the second ring road are relatively balanced; More than 70% of residential communities and more than 65% of JieDao accessibility in the city are within 20 minutes, indicating a high level of overall urban accessibility. The accessibility level of residential areas within the Second Ring Road area is high, while the accessibility level of the outside area is low. Among the four types of public service facilities, the accessibility level of primary schools is the highest; Except for the elderly's access to medical care, the distribution of most public resources is negatively correlated with the needs of the population, and there is a certain dislocation in the distribution of public resources. In areas with high demand for public services, more than 50% of public service facilities have a good level of accessibility, and there is a certain gap in the fairness of resource allocation between middle schools and shopping centers. According to the accessibility and supply and demand of different regions, it is suggested to adopt different appropriate transportation modes, enrich public transportation lines and trunk lines, reduce areas with high demand and low accessibility, and improve public service facilities based on residents' demand to match the efficiency and reduce the contradiction between supply and demand.","2161-0258","979-8-3503-0988-1","10.1109/Geoinformatics57846.2022.9963847","Shandong Provincial Natural Science Foundation, China(grant numbers:ZR2021ME203); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9963847","Crowdsourcing geographic data;public service facilities;accessibility;matching supply and demand","Crowdsourcing;Supply and demand;Roads;Education;Urban areas;Sociology;Medical services","","","","35","IEEE","2 Dec 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Besides, improving artificial intelligence (AI), by machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL) or cognitive learning (CL) performance/potential, when adding human contributions where necessary, is an important and promising research area. Consequently, our model, algorithms (ALG1; ALG2) and soft programs provide useful new instruments for implementing and optimizing the workflow based on crowdsourcing, when using human potential in a human computing system. We aim to increase AI quality adding multiple human outputs for every AI task and leveraging learning rules to be then extended to larger sets of tasks. This way, such hybrid system could be oriented to more knowledge extraction, by the generalization of images/ captions/labels toward more complex tasks, like providing content essential or question answering. Our instruments include features of ranking workers and tasks profiles, which will support the main original process of knowledge extraction, but also the inference elements, by small amounts of learning data (regarding the workers skills and tasks efficiency) to be transferred to AI/ML/DL/CL, which then could be used for processing larger volumes of similar data. Among the results conclusions is that using progressive optimization, structuring the data/tasks in variable (progressive) sets and potential (skill/number) of workers, is both efficacious and efficient, allowing a flexible control of the system and workflow for matching a diversity of tasks complexity/ difficulty/volume and leveraging knowledge extraction.","","978-1-7281-5611-8","10.1109/COMM48946.2020.9141972","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9141972","human computing;artificial intelligence;entropy;crowdsourcing;knowledge extraction;image recognition;labelling","Task analysis;Artificial intelligence;Feature extraction;Optimization;Computational modeling;Crowdsourcing;Data mining","","","","11","IEEE","16 Jul 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We frame the problem as a submodular optimization, and propose a greedy allocation strategy that exhibits an interesting trade-off between a local effect, which encourages acquiring true labels for the most uncertain items, and a global effect, which favors the true labels of the most “influential” items, whose information can propagate to help the prediction of other items.

Over the years, many different approaches have been proposed in order to perform the process in an effective way. The analysis of the literature in this field addresses the lack of benefiting users' potential and capabilities to improve the process. However, there are some user-centric studies that incorporated users in the process in some way; to the best of the authors' knowledge, there is not any focused research work the respected literature that leverages human computation ability in this regard. On the other side, taking advantages of humans computing and processing abilities is currently known as a well-experienced strategy to solve computing problems in different contexts. Specifically, in the field of database and query processing there are several seminal works that leveraged users' participation in order to improve the process. Following such an idea, in this paper a crowdsourcing-based XML keyword searching approach is proposed. In addition to explaining the conceptual architecture and details of different parts of the proposed approach, the efficiency of the introduced approach is proved through conducting some experiments. The authors believe that the presented solution, as the first step, can provide a roadmap for the future works in the field.","","978-1-7281-1431-6","10.1109/ICWR.2019.8765281","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8765281","Component;Crowdsourcing;XML keyword search;XML processing;Query processing;human computation;usability","XML;Keyword search;Task analysis;Query processing;Architecture;Crowdsourcing;Semantics","","","","47","IEEE","18 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To improve the search efficiency, a group of investigators are usually assigned the same task to re-identify a suspect from a shared gallery set. Due to their personalized viewpoints and search feedback operations, different investigators may obtain diverse search results of the same query target. In this case, merging different rankings and generating an improved result is of great importance. To this end, this paper proposes a crowdsourcing-based ranking aggregation to adaptively fuse multiple ranking lists for re-ID problem. The method estimates the reliability of individual investigators, with a specifically designed long tail distribution to fit the top ranking demand, and is feasible for human-machine interaction.

The algorithm can integrate the annotation results of multiple annotators on the same landslide into a consensus curve to solve the problem of subjective biases in annotation results owing to differences in the perception of landslides among annotators. Meanwhile, in order to match annotators of different abilities with different tasks, a task recommendation algorithm which can assess difficulty of annotation tasks based on complexity of landslide contour curves and establish user profiles based on historical task records is proposed.

Therefore, developers have to constantly reformulate their queries by correcting misspelled words, adding limitations to certain programming languages or platforms, etc. As query reformulation is tedious for developers, especially for novices, we propose an automated software-specific query reformulation approach based on deep learning. With query logs provided by Stack Overflow, we construct a large-scale query reformulation corpus, including the original queries and corresponding reformulated ones.

Aims: We seek to understand the challenges developers face in the process of ML application development and offer insights to simplify the process. Despite its importance, there has been little research on this topic. A few existing studies on development challenges with ML are outdated, small scale, or they do no involve a representative set of developers. Method: We conduct an empirical study of ML-related developer posts on Stack Overflow. We perform in-depth quantitative and qualitative analyses focusing on a series of research questions related to the challenges of developing ML applications and the directions to address them. Results: Our findings include: (1) ML questions suffer from a much higher percentage of unanswered questions on Stack Overflow than other domains; (2) there is a lack of ML experts in the Stack Overflow QA community; (3) the data preprocessing and model deployment phases are where most of the challenges lay; and (4) addressing most of these challenges require more ML implementation knowledge than ML conceptual knowledge. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that most challenges are under the data preparation and model deployment phases, i.e., early and late stages. Also, the implementation aspect of ML shows much higher difficulty level among developers than the conceptual aspect.","1949-3789","978-1-7281-2968-6","10.1109/ESEM.2019.8870187","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8870187","Machine Learning;Software Development;Stack Overflow;Data Mining","Machine learning;Software;Libraries;Face;Data models;Task analysis;Analytical models","","32","","32","IEEE","17 Oct 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Chatbot development requires special expertise (e.g., machine learning and conversation design) that differ from the development of traditional software systems. At the same time, the challenges that chatbot developers face remain mostly unknown since most of the existing studies focus on proposing chatbots to perform particular tasks rather than their development. Therefore, in this paper, we examine the Q&A website, Stack Overflow, to provide insights on the topics that chatbot developers are interested and the challenges they face. In particular, we leverage topic modeling to understand the topics that are being discussed by chatbot developers on Stack Overflow. Then, we examine the popularity and difficulty of those topics. Our results show that most of the chatbot developers are using Stack Overflow to ask about implementation guidelines. We determine 12 topics that developers discuss (e.g., Model Training) that fall into five main categories. Most of the posts belong to chatbot development, integration, and the natural language understanding (NLU) model categories. On the other hand, we find that developers consider the posts of building and integrating chatbots topics more helpful compared to other topics. Specifically, developers face challenges in the training of the chatbot's model. We believe that our study guides future research to propose techniques and tools to help the community at its early stages to overcome the most popular and difficult topics that practitioners face when developing chatbots.","2574-3864","978-1-4503-7517-7","10.1145/3379597.3387472","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10148686","Software Chatbots Development;Empirical Study;Chatbot Issues;Stack Overflow","Training;Pressing;Oral communication;Machine learning;Chatbots;Software systems;Data mining","","30","","76","","20 Jun 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) is a commonly used topic model that aims to explain the structure of a corpus by grouping texts. LDA requires multiple parameters to work well, and there are only rough and sometimes conflicting guidelines available on how these parameters should be set. In this paper, we contribute (i) a broad study of parameters to arrive at good local optima for GitHub and Stack Overflow text corpora, (ii) an a-posteriori characterisation of text corpora related to eight programming languages, and (iii) an analysis of corpus feature importance via per-corpus LDA configuration.

This phenomenon might prevent their questions from getting prompt and appropriate solutions. In this paper, we report an exploratory study on the reproducibility of the issues discussed in 400 questions of Stack Overflow. In particular, we parse, compile, execute and even carefully examine the code segments from these questions, spent a total of 200 man hours, and then attempt to reproduce their programming issues. The outcomes of our study are two-fold. First, we find that 68% of the code segments require minor and major modifications in order to reproduce the issues reported by the developers. On the contrary, 22% code segments completely fail to reproduce the issues. We also carefully investigate why these issues could not be reproduced and then provide evidence-based guidelines for writing effective code examples for Stack Overflow questions. Second, we investigate the correlation between issue reproducibility status (of questions) and corresponding answer meta-data such as the presence of an accepted answer. According to our analysis, a question with reproducible issues has at least three times higher chance of receiving an accepted answer than the question with irreproducible issues.","2574-3864","978-1-7281-3412-3","10.1109/MSR.2019.00074","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8816784","Issue reproducibility;Stack Overflow;code segments;code level modifications;reproducibility challenges","Java;Libraries;Programming;Manuals;Random access memory;Software;Correlation","","17","","29","IEEE","29 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In the worst case, bad usage of these constructs might lead to errors, to ineffective queries, or hamper developers in their tasks. This paper presents a mining technique for Stack Overflow to identify error-prone patterns in SQL queries. Identifying such patterns can help developers to avoid the use of error-prone constructs, or if they have to use such constructs, the Stack Overflow posts can help them to properly utilize the language. Hence, our purpose is to provide the initial steps towards a recommendation system that supports developers in constructing SQL queries. Our current implementation supports the MySQL dialect, and Stack Overflow has over 300,000 questions tagged with the MySQL flag in its database. It provides a huge knowledge base where developers can ask questions about real problems. Our initial results indicate that our technique is indeed able to identify patterns among them.","","978-1-4673-7532-0","10.1109/ICSM.2015.7332505","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7332505","SQL;Mining Stack Overflow;Error Patterns;Code Clones;Recommendation Systems","Java;Cloning;XML;Encoding;Programming;Syntactics;Databases","","14","","17","IEEE","23 Nov 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Therefore, improving the quality of question posts in Stack Overflow has attracted the wide attention of researchers. A concise and precise title can play an important role in helping developers understand the key information of the question post, which can improve the post quality. How-ever, the quality of the generated title is not high due to the lack of professional knowledge related to their questions or the poor presentation ability of developers. A previous study aimed to automatically generate the title by analyzing the code snippets in the question post. However, this study ignored the useful information in the corresponding problem description. Therefore, we propose an approach SOTitle for automatic post title generation by leveraging the code snippets and the problem description in the question post (i.e., the multi-modal input). SOTitle follows the Transformer structure, which can effectively capture long-term dependencies through a multi-head attention mechanism. To verify the effectiveness of SOTitle, we construct a large-scale high-quality corpus from Stack Overflow, which includes 1,168,257 high-quality question posts for four popular programming languages. Experimental results show that SOTitle can significantly outperform six state-of-the-art baselines in both automatic evaluation and human evaluation.

Tags play a critical role in efficiently structuring the contents in Stack Overflow and are vital to support a range of site operations, e.g., querying relevant contents. Poorly selected tags often introduce extra noise and redundancy, which raises problems like tag synonym and tag explosion. Thus, an automated tag recommendation technique that can accurately recommend high-quality tags is desired to alleviate the problems mentioned above. Inspired by the recent success of pre-trained language models (PTMs) in natural language processing (NLP), we present PTM4Tag, a tag recommendation framework for Stack Overflow posts that utilize PTMs with a triplet architecture, which models the components of a post, i.e., Title, Description, and Code with independent language models. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that leverages PTMs in the tag recommendation task of SQA sites. We comparatively evaluate the performance of PTM4Tag based on five popular pre-trained models: BERT, RoBERTa, ALBERT, CodeBERT, and BERTOverflow. Our results show that leveraging CodeBERT, a software engineering (SE) domain-specific PTM in PTM4Tag achieves the best performance among the five considered PTMs and outperforms the state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Network-based approach by a large margin in terms of average Precision@k, Recall@k, and F1-score@k. We conduct an ablation study to quantify the contribution of a post's constituent components (Title, Description, and Code Snippets) to the performance of PTM4Tag.

Moreover, little is known about how these attractors help developers (students and professionals) answer comprehension questions.

Results indicate that on average paragraphs and code snippets were fixated upon most often and longest. When ranking pages by number of appearance of code blocks and paragraphs, we found that while the presence of more code blocks did not affect number of fixations, the presence of increasing numbers of plain text paragraphs significantly drove down the fixations on comments. SO posts that were looked at only by students had longer fixation times on code elements within the first ten fixations. We found that 16 developer summaries contained 5 or more meaningful terms from SO posts they viewed.

From a viewpoint of a technology product owner, Stack Overflow can report various issues that product users have, and this serves as valuable input to the product improvement process. This paper proposes an automated approach to classifying questions that are posted on Stack Overflow with regard to a certain kind of products, i.e. database products in particular. The categories of questions are defined at two levels, i.e problem and subproblem. The problem level includes development, installation, and performance tuning, while the subproblem level consists of design, limitation, and discussion. By cross-combining the two levels, questions can be classified into nine problem-subproblem classes. Natural language processing and text classification are used with several machine learning algorithms, i.e. Naïve Bayes, Decision Tree, Extra Trees, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Stochastic Gradient Descent, Deep Learning Neural Network, and Convolutional Neural Network. The best classifiers for all classes are used further in a web-based tool that can classify each question by a problem-subproblem tag and also report the number of problems that users of a database product have posted. This information can benefit the owner of a database product in planning product maintenance and evolution.","","978-1-7281-7677-2","10.1109/SERA51205.2021.9509047","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9509047","text classification;natural language processing;machine learning;Stack Overflow;software maintenance","Solid modeling;Databases;Text categorization;Stochastic processes;Vegetation;Tools;Programming","","2","","12","IEEE","11 Aug 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A more effective way is to provide accurate completion suggestions when developers compose titles. Inspired by this idea, we are the first to study the problem of automatic question title completion for Stack Overflow and then propose a novel approach QTC4SO. Specifically, we first preprocess the gathered post titles to form incomplete titles (i.e., tip information provided by developers) for simulating the scene of this task. Then we construct the multi-modal input by concatenating the incomplete title with the post’s contents (i.e., the problem description and the code snippet). Later, we adopt multi-task learning to the question title completion task for multiple programming languages. Finally, we adopt a pre-trained model T5 to learn the title completion patterns automatically. To evaluate the effectiveness of QTC4SO, we gathered 164,748 high-quality posts from Stack Overflow by covering eight popular programming languages. Our empirical results show that compared with the approaches of directly generating question titles, our proposed approach QTC4SO is more practical in automatic and human evaluation.

Crowdsourcing is a process of recruiting anonymous members of the public to solve/perform different tasks without supervision. This approach of seeking solutions from the public has been enhanced by ubiquitous internet connectivity, low cost and the ease to recruit workers without geographical restrictions. Although crowdsourcing makes it possible to save cost and reach a large group of people to perform subjective video quality testing, challenges such as validity of results and the trustworthiness of workers still remain unresolved. In this paper, we attempt to address some of these challenges by developing a screening algorithm that is able to determine the validity and trustworthiness of crowdsourcing video QoE evaluation results. This algorithm is based on evaluator's extracted data (e.g. Network IP addresses, network devices and browser information, time spent on the crowdsourcing platform, date and grading patterns). To determine the performance of this algorithm, we carried out a separate controlled laboratory based subjective video quality testing.

In product design and development, one of the crowdsourcing objectives is to engage various users into human-centered design processes and outsource tasks to crowds for better design efficiency, quality and business benefits. There are many studies about crowdsourcing from different viewpoints, but none of them focuses on crowdsourcing technology review, especially in product design and development. In this paper, we report a literature review of crowdsourcing technology including the task assignment techniques, incentive mechanism and communication skills, crowdsourcing framework, and platforms. We also discuss the existing problems: 1) current crowdsourcing platforms only partly support product design activities; 2) crowd workers' privacy may be threatened; 3) some cheat phenomenon may exist on some platforms. Finally, we suggest the future directions on the related crowdsourcing technology.","","978-0-7017-0260-1","10.23919/IConAC.2017.8081981","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8081981","crowdsourcing technology;task assignment;incentive mechanism;communication techniques;product design and development","Crowdsourcing;Servers;Product design;Collaboration;Business;Bibliographies","","5","","54","","26 Oct 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

While decentralized blockchain-based crowdsourcing provides numerous benefits compared to centralized solutions, current implementations of decentralized crowdsourcing suffer from fundamental scalability limitations by requiring all participants to pay a small transaction fee every time they interact with the blockchain. This increases the cost of using decentralized crowdsourcing solutions, resulting in a total payment that could be even higher than the price charged by centralized crowdsourcing platforms. This paper proposes a novel suite of protocols called NF-Crowd that resolves the scalability issue by reducing the lower bound of the total cost of a decentralized crowdsourcing project to O(1). NF-Crowd is a highly reliable solution for scaling decentralized crowdsourcing. We prove that as long as participants of a project powered by NF-Crowd are rational, the O(1) lower bound of cost could be reached regardless of the scale of the crowd. We also demonstrate that as long as at least one participant of a project powered by NF-Crowd is honest, the project cannot be aborted and the results are guaranteed to be correct. We design NF-Crowd protocols for a representative type of project named crowdsourcing contest with open community review (CC-OCR). We implement the protocols over the Ethereum official test network. Our results demonstrate that NF-Crowd protocols can reduce the cost of running a CC-OCR project to less than $2 regardless of the scale of the crowd, providing a significant cost benefit in adopting decentralized crowdsourcing solutions.","2575-8462","978-1-7281-7626-0","10.1109/SRDS51746.2020.00012","Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9252017","","Crowdsourcing;Protocols;Distributed ledger;Scalability;Smart contracts;Blockchain;Reliability","","5","","39","IEEE","12 Nov 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The acceptability and annoyance paradigm serves as a tool to understand this relationship by measuring QoE as a function of user expectations and video quality. Traditionally, subjective experiments assessing QoE have been conducted in controlled laboratory settings. While the extension of traditional video quality experiments to crowdsourcing settings is well-explored, the impact of crowdsourcing on QoE studies has not been thoroughly examined. This study explore the potential use of crowdsourcing platforms for acceptability & annoyance experiments. To this end, video quality and acceptability & annoyance experiments were conducted in both laboratory and crowdsourcing settings. The findings reveal a more linear relationship between video quality and QoE in crowdsourcing settings. Subjects in crowdsourcing settings tend to have higher expectations of video quality, resulting in a slight increase in acceptability & annoyance thresholds compared to laboratory experiments. Analyses suggest that extending acceptability & annoyance experiments to crowdsourcing is not as straightforward as extending traditional video quality experiments. In crowdsourcing settings, priming subject expectations with instructions is not as effective as it is in laboratory conditions.","2381-8549","979-8-3503-4939-9","10.1109/ICIP51287.2024.10647945","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10647945","acceptability and annoyance;quality of experience;video quality;crowdsourcing;user generated content","Crowdsourcing;Image coding;Social networking (online);Pipelines;Streaming media;Observers;Quality assessment","","","","22","IEEE","27 Sep 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To address these issues, this paper investigates a challenge problem which we study how to intelligently task assignments for interactive spatial crowdsourcing applications. Therefore, we develop an advanced Embedding-based Deterministic Policy Gradient learning framework to maximize long term crowdsourcing rewards for task assignments, called EDPG-Assignment. EDPG-Assignment is based on deep actor critic learning and combines the improvements of two advanced methods, action embedding and neighbor-based deep Deterministic Policy Gradient, and employed this to optimize the task assignment in interactive crowdsourcing.

We present a study of the popular Q&A website StackOverflow (SO), in which users ask and answer questions about software development, algorithms, math and other technical topics.

The contributions of very high reputation users to the site indicate that they are the primary source of answers, and especially of high quality answers. Interestingly, we find that while the majority of questions on the site are asked by low reputation users, on average a high reputation user asks more questions than a user with low reputation. We consider a number of graph analysis methods for detecting influential and anomalous users in the underlying user interaction network, and find they are effective in detecting extreme behaviors such as those of spam users.

Based on those answers, we studied topics of the discussion threads, answer characteristics (e.g., scores, ages, code lengths, and text lengths), and developers’ reuse practices.We observed that most reused answers offer programs to implement specific coding tasks. Among all analyzed SO discussion threads, the reused answers often have higher scores, older ages, longer code, and longer text than unused answers. In only 9% of scenarios (40/430), developers fully copied answer code for reuse. In the remaining scenarios, they reused partial code or created brand new code from scratch. Our study characterized 130 SO discussion threads referred to by Java developers in 357 GitHub projects. Our observations can guide SO answerers to provide better answers, and shed lights on future human-centric research that creates better tools to help with code reuse.CCS CONCEPTS•General and reference → Empirical studies;•Software and its engineering → Development frameworks and environments.","2151-0849","979-8-4007-1249-4","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10765084","Empirical;StackOverflow;GitHub;answer reuse;clone detection","Java;Codes;Manuals;Inspection;Software;Encoding;Data mining;Software development management;Message systems;Software engineering","","","","54","","28 Nov 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Then, based on this metric system, the collected Zhihu data is annotated and an answer quality automated evaluation model using Word2VecCNN (convolutional neural networks) is developed. Utilize this model to perform both coarse-grained and fine-grained automated evaluation of answer quality in online Q&A communities. Compared to other models, the proposed Word2Vec-CNN-based automatic answer quality evaluation model in this research yielded superior experimental results, particularly in the realms of syntax, semantics, and pragmatics. Furthermore, it closely approximated the manually curated content found in “Zhihu Daily.” It excelled in filtering high-quality answers, significantly enhancing users’ efficiency in acquiring knowledge during their actual browsing experiences within the Q&A community.

For example, recent results show that for finding related Stack Overflow posts, a tuned SVM performs similarly to a deep learner, but is significantly faster to train.This paper extends that recent result by clustering the dataset, then tuning every learners within each cluster. This approach is over 500 times faster than deep learning (and over 900 times faster if we use all the cores on a standard laptop computer). Significantly, this faster approach generates classifiers nearly as good (within 2% F1 Score) as the much slower deep learning method. Hence we recommend this faster methods since it is much easier to reproduce and utilizes far fewer CPU resources.

The DARPA InSPIRE program is using crowdsourcing to develop spaceflight software for small satellites under a sub-program called SPHERES Zero Robotics - a space robotics programming competition. The robots are miniature satellites, called SPHERES, that operate inside the International Space Station (ISS). The idea is to allow thousands of amateur participants to program using the SPHERES simulator and eventually test their algorithms in microgravity. The entire software framework for the program, to provide the ability for thousands to collaboratively use the SPHERES simulator and create algorithms, is also built by crowdsourcing.

While it is valuable, traditional crowdsourcing systems lock computation resources inside each individual system where tasks cannot reach numerous potential workers among the other systems. Therefore, there is a great need to build a federated platform for different crowdsourcing systems to share resources. However, the security issue lies in the center of constructing the federated crowdsourcing platform. Although many studies are focusing on privacy-preserving crowdsourcing, existing solutions require a trusted third party to perform the key management, which is not applicable in our federated platform. The reason is that it is difficult for a third party to be trusted by various systems. In this paper, we present a secure crowdsourcing framework as our initial effort toward this direction, which bridges together the recent advancements of blockchain and cryptographic techniques. Our proposed design, named PFcrowd, allows different crowdsourcing systems to perform encrypted task-worker matching over the blockchain platform without involving any third-party authority. The core idea is to utilize the blockchain to assist the federated crowdsourcing by moving the task recommendation algorithm to the trusted smart contract. To avoid third-party involvement, we first leverage the re-writable deterministic hashing (RDH) technique to convert the problem of federated task-worker matching into the secure query authorization. We then devise a secure scheme based on RDH and searchable encryption (SE) to support privacy-preserving task-worker matching via the smart contract. We formally analyze the security of our proposed scheme and implement the system prototype on Ethereum. Extensive evaluations of real-world datasets demonstrate the efficiency of our design.","1548-615X","978-1-7281-6887-6","10.1109/IWQoS49365.2020.9212891","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9212891","Federated Crowdsourcing;Re-writable Deterministic Hashing;Searchable Encryption;Blockchain","Task analysis;Crowdsourcing;Indexes;Cryptography;Authorization;Contracts","","17","","52","IEEE","6 Oct 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Moreover, dynamic spatial task assignment is further complicated when there are large-scale tasks and crowd-workers in crowdsourcing environments. Therefore in this paper, we propose a dynamic optimization algorithm based on Spatial-aware Multi-Agent Q-Learning (SMAQL), which can keep higher effectiveness in face of uncertainty and large-scale problems in complex crowdsourcing scenario. The proposed approach combines spatial optimization with multi-agent Q-Iearning. S-MAQL algorithm decomposes the crowdsourcing optimization problem into many sub-problems by means of a grid-based spatial optimization approach. And each agent utilizes Q-Iearning algorithms to handle its own region optimization problems of the real-time crowdsourcing.

However, while crowdsourcing fatigue issue is commonly recognized, there is still lack of systematic study to understand how exactly fatigue occurs and how it affects crowdsourcing. This paper presents an experimental study to investigate these issues by employing quantitative and qualitative means with an image-tagging project on a crowdsourcing platform.

Recently, the usage of crowdsourcing micro-task platforms for assessing the media quality is increasing. The crowdsourcing platforms provide access to a pool of geographically distributed, and demographically diverse group of workers who participate in the experiment in their own working environment and using their own hardware. The main challenge in crowdsourcing QoE tests is to control the effect of interfering influencing factors such as a user's environment and device on the subjective ratings. While in the past, the crowdsourcing approach was frequently used for speech and video quality assessment, research on a quality assessment for gaming services is rare. In this paper, we present a method to measure gaming QoE under typically considered system influence factors including delay, packet loss, and framerates as well as different game designs. The factors are artificially manipulated due to controlled changes in the implementation of games. The results of a total of five studies using a developed evaluation method based on a combination of the ITU-T Rec. P.809 on subjective evaluation methods for gaming quality and the ITU-T Rec.

However, there are a significant number of inactive developers who have very sparse historical behavior records in the platform, and thus state-of-the-art recommendation approaches in software crowdsourcing, such as collaborative filtering, suffer from this cold-start problem. In this paper, a social influence-based method is proposed to recommend suitable tasks for both active and inactive developers. The essential idea of the novel method is (1) to construct developer social network from developer behaviors, such as browsing and bidding for tasks, (2) to calculate the influence degrees between developers using developer social network, (3) to recommend tasks to active developers using SiSVD, and (4) to recommend tasks to inactive developers by combining the recommended tasks of their friends.

To address these issues, we propose a privacy-preserving interest-ability based task allocation scheme in crowdsourcing, which protects both task and worker privacy and enables the crowdsourcing server to allocate tasks in a fine-grained way. Specifically, by utilizing attribute-based encryption (ABE) and proxy re-encryption based searchable encryption (PRE-SE) on the task content and task tags respectively, customers are able to enforce fine-grained ability requirements on their tasks, and workers can specify flexible interests to choose their desired tasks. Additionally, ElGamal signature enables workers to prove their abilities to the crowdsourcing server without revealing the task content.

Based on the blockchain technology, we propose a new and decentralized trusted service mechanism for crowdsourcing system. The crowdsourcing service process is divided into nine stages, and the smart contract controls the execution of each step in each stage. In addition, the payment is completed by transferring within the blockchain. Finally, we develop smart contracts to conduct experiments based on Ethereum, and conduct comparison experiments. The experimental results show that the effectiveness and applicability of the service of the crowdsourcing system service mechanism without the central institutions.","2577-2465","978-1-7281-5207-3","10.1109/VTC2020-Spring48590.2020.9128425","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9128425","blockchain;crowdsourcing;decentralization;secure payment;smart contract","Crowdsourcing;Task analysis;Blockchain;Security;Computer science;Smart contracts","","7","","33","IEEE","30 Jun 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In addition, each crowdsourcing operation has a cost, e.g., data traffic or energy consumption, and each crowdsourcing location might have a crowdsourcing budget for the visited workers. The objective of this paper is to find a worker recruiting algorithm, which ensures the coverage requirement and minimizes the maximal crowdsourcing cost for any crowdsourcing location. We gradually discuss the problem from the 1-D scenario to the general 2-D scenario. In the 1-D scenario, we propose a bounded directional greedy algorithm first. Then, we propose a PTAS extension. A dynamic programming solution is further proposed with a higher computation complexity. In the 2-D scenario, we propose a randomized rounding algorithm with an O(log n/log log n) approximation ratio in a high probability.

In crowdsourcing a task is delivered to a crowd of participants who will work on this task. Task allocation is then an important aspect in the context of crowdsourcing. If done properly, it delivers successful results based on the answers provided by the crowd. However, task allocation in crowdsourcing is not a trivial problem. Factors like a task’s requirements, the knowledge required for its resolution, and the size and heterogeneity of the participants in the crowd all impact task allocation, and therefore, the expected quality of the task results. In this case, the execution of actions from a plan, which assist the dynamic tasks’ allocation in crowdsourcing systems, become relevant as an alternative solution. This paper formalizes task allocation in crowdsourcing scenarios as an artificial intelligence planning problem. Our results suggest that task allocation has several challenges when it is observed in distributed, undefined and dynamic environments, like in crowdsourcing scenarios.

One of competitive functions of these platforms is to recommend proficient projects to developers. However, in such recommender system, there exists a serious platform cold-start problem, especially for new software crowdsourcing platforms, as they usually have too little cumulative data to support accurate model training and prediction. This paper focuses on solving the platform cold-start problem in software crowdsourcing recommendation system by transfer learning technologies. We proposed a novel cross-platform recommendation method for new software crowdsourcing platforms, whose idea is trying to transfer data and knowledge from other mature software crowdsourcing platforms (source domains) to solve the insufficient recommendation model training problem in a new platform (target domain). The proposed method maps different kinds of features both in the source domain and the target domain after a certain transformation and combination to a latent space by learning the correspondences between features. Specifically, our method is an instance of content-based recommendation, which uses tags and keywords extracted from project description in crowdsourcing platforms as features, and then set weights for each feature to reflect its importance. Then, Weight-SCL is proposed to merge and distinguish tag features and keyword features before doing feature mapping and data migration to implement knowledge transformation. Finally, we use the data from two famous software crowdsourcing platform as dataset, and a series of experiments are conducted to evaluate the performance of the multi-source recommendation system in comparison with the baseline methods, and get 1.2X performance promotion.","","978-1-5386-3681-7","10.1109/APSEC.2017.33","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8305949","Tranfer Learning;Software Crowdsourcing;Recommender Systems;Cold-start Problem","Software;Crowdsourcing;Software algorithms;Data models;Feature extraction;Matrix decomposition;Training","","4","","27","IEEE","5 Mar 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Many papers propose incentive strategies to motivate workers to participate in crowdsourcing. In this paper, we shift the focus from the workers to the job requesters by addressing two of their issues: how to design a good payment scheme to maximize profit and how to select qualified workers to do the job. We use a widely-adopted payment formula consisting of a base salary and extra bonus. We first formulate the problem as an optimization problem and then provide a general solution in which we show that the pay rate can be the same to all the workers. Next we instantiate the solution with a concrete example to derive more concrete results and propose a worker selection algorithm WS. In WS, we not only consider workers' workload demands but also their past working performance to guarantee crowdsourcing quality. Simulation results show that a job requester can pay much less to get the job done in a crowdsourcing environment and our worker selection algorithm is efficient in that it only searches a tiny space to find the solution to the optimization problem. Our effort here provides an evidence to support the benefits of using crowdsourcing in our daily lives.","1938-1883","978-1-4673-8999-0","10.1109/ICC.2017.7996432","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7996432","crowdsourcing;optimization;pay rate;workload","Crowdsourcing;Optimization;Concrete;Algorithm design and analysis;Mobile communication;Ad hoc networks;Remuneration","","3","","20","IEEE","31 Jul 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Sustaining solvers participation is therefore an agendum that should be given consideration during the design of a mobile crowdsourcing initiative, particularly in the nonprofit ones where financial rewards are not normally offered to the solvers. Therefore, other forms of rewarding mechanisms, if any, have to be made equally compelling from the solvers point of view, and this begins with identifying the factors that influence sustained solvers participation in non-profit mobile crowdsourcing initiatives. To identify these factors, a systematic literature review was performed, which focused on factors affecting returning or subsequent solvers participation. A total of seven factors were identified, which were validated using a selection of successful non-profit mobile crowdsourcing applications. Result obtained showed that mobile crowdsourcing application that implemented all of the factors received the highest rating from the users, indicating the potential of using these factors as basis in developing non-profit mobile crowdsourcing applications that can sustain solvers participation.","","978-1-4673-9572-4","10.1109/SCORED.2015.7449420","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7449420","non-profit crowdsourcing;mobile crowdsourcing;systematic review;sustained participation","Crowdsourcing;Mobile communication;Conferences;Research and development;Mobile handsets;Systematics;Context","","2","","23","IEEE","9 Apr 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper proposes a novel crowdsourcing method Truth Inference based on Graph Embedding (TIGE) for single-choice questions, the method draws on the idea of graph autoencoder, constructs feature vectors for each crowdsourcing task, embeds the relationship between crowdsourcing tasks and workers in graphs, then uses graph neural networks to convert crowdsourcing problems into graph node prediction problems. The feature vectors are continuously optimized in the convolutional layer to obtain the final result. Compared with the six state-of-the-art algorithms on real-world datasets, our method has significant advantages in accuracy and F1-score.","","978-1-6654-3858-2","10.1109/ICKG52313.2021.00036","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2018YFC1603601); Program for Innovative Research Team(grant numbers:IRT_17R32); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61906059,62120106008); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9667728","Crowdsourcing truth inference;graph embedding;single-choice classification","Crowdsourcing;Training;Graphical models;Probabilistic logic;Prediction algorithms;Graph neural networks;Robustness","","1","","25","IEEE","14 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The strategy is operationalised through an appropriately established crowdsourcing process. A few computer-supported systems have developed to assist several aspects of the crowdsourcing process. However, these systems mainly focus on a particular aspect rather than the whole integrated process. Furthermore, there is a shortage in empirical evidence on how the developed systems support the establishment of crowdsourcing processes. This paper presents our initial experimental evidences on using a designed decision tool in supporting the integrated crowdsourcing process. The experiments show that the designed tool is likely to improve participants' performance on designing crowdsourcing processes, but not in making the decision to crowdsource. Based on the experiment results, the paper suggests several lessons and recommendations for future research.","","978-1-5090-1915-1","10.1109/CSCWD.2016.7566058","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7566058","business process crowdsourcing;crowdsourcing;computer supported system;experiment","Crowdsourcing;Decision support systems;Handheld computers;Process control;Business;Systems support","","1","","24","IEEE","15 Sep 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Therefore, it proposes making full use of the untapped human capital in rural areas and giving full play to the role of crowdsourcing logistics in the rural logistics network. This paper employs the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and fuzzy comprehensive evaluation as part of the research method to analyse the feasibility of the innovative mode of rural crowdsourcing logistics. Furthermore, from the perspective of the crowdsourcing-based rural logistics network design, the paper presents a concept that focuses on the last-mile delivery method in rural logistics, the establishment of crowdsourcing information platforms in rural areas, the design of the distribution process, and crowdsourcing platform management suggestions. The research method is exploratory and based on aspects of an appropriate literature review of logistics networks and crowdsourcing.","2159-5100","978-1-890843-39-7","10.23919/PICMET.2019.8893791","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8893791","","Logistics;Crowdsourcing","","1","","29","","7 Nov 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
