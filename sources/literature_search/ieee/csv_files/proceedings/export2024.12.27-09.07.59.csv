This paper discusses the user validation results of user interface design through user experience measured by intuitiveness, recall, and accuracy. For keywords, results showed that keywords were appropriate however there is a need to include selection of multiple keywords as well as language translated into native tongue. For icons, intuitiveness score were relatively high for most icons. Icons that had low recognition were because of multiple interpretations. Recall scores increased significantly after training.

They were shaped around a specific idea in the mind, to beat FIFA World Cup champions by 2050. In this regard and based on the prospective roadmap, soccer robot field has become a fertile testbed for developing Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning algorithms and methods as well as mechanical equipments design. Despite the advancements achieved over the years, it seems there is a long way ahead to meet the determined goal, at least from the âsoftâ perspectives, including decision making, action selection, etc. In other words, lack of human-level intelligence to provide robots with capabilities to compete with human counterparts is a great drawback. To cope with such issues, a working solution may be to train soccer agents by humans. Following this idea, in this paper a conceptual view of a novel crowdsourcing-based framework for soccer robots to learn (human-like) decision making is proposed. Also, different aspects of the system are studied. It is believed that such an approach can greatly improve soccer robots' ability to make proper and effective decisions - and subsequently selecting best actions- in different situations. Moreover, it could be regarded as a first step towards equipping soccer agents with necessary human-level requirements for the ultimate goal.","","978-1-5090-2169-7","10.1109/RIOS.2016.7529514","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7529514","Soccer Robots;High-level Control;Decision Making;Learning;Crowdsourcing","Robots;Crowdsourcing;Postal services","","7","","31","IEEE","4 Aug 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

On microtask platforms no worker is fully reliable for a task and it is likely that some workers are spammers, in the sense that they provide a random answer to collect the financial reward. Existence of spammers is harmful as they increase the cost of microtasking and will negatively affect the answer aggregation process. Hence, to discriminate spammers and non-spammers one needs to measure worker reliability to predict how likely that a worker put an effort in solving a task. In this paper we introduce a new reliability estimation algorithm works based on bee colony algorithm called REBECO. This algorithm relies on Gaussian process model to estimate reliability of workers dynamically. With bees that go in search of pollen, some are more successful than the others. This maps well to our problem, where some workers (i.e., bees) are more successful than other workers for a given task thus, giving rise to a reliability measure. Answer aggregation with respect to worker reliability rates has been considered as a suitable replacement for conventional majority voting. We compared REBECO with majority voting using two real world datasets. The results indicate that REBECO is able to outperform MV significantly.","","978-1-5090-6167-9","10.1109/ICMLA.2016.0127","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7838231","Bee colony;Crowdsourcing;Gaussian process model;Worker reliability estimation","Reliability;Heuristic algorithms;Estimation;Crowdsourcing;Gaussian processes;Australia;Business","","7","","13","IEEE","2 Feb 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, it is a difficult problem to determine the payments which should be accepted by both requesters and workers. In this paper, We propose a complete task assignment mechanism. The first step, we group tasks by Tasks Grouping with Cohesion (TGC), Tasks Grouping with Relevance (TGR) and Tasks Grouping with Similarity (TGS) respectively to form task groups. In the second step, we assign workers to task groups through worker selection mechanisms Workers Selection with Fixed Price (WSFP) and Workers Selection with Changing Price (WSCP). We prove that our mechanism is individual-rational, budget-balance, truthful and computationally efficient. Finally, we evaluate the mechanism through a lot of experiments.","","978-1-7281-0548-2","10.1109/MSN.2018.00018","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8692035","Mobile Crowdsourcing;sensing data;group;task assignment;worker selection","Task analysis;Sensors;Crowdsourcing;Software;Temperature distribution;Recruitment;Computational modeling","","7","","18","IEEE","18 Apr 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This research objective is to develop Indonesian abbreviated words dataset, which can then be used to normalize any abbreviated words in Indonesian. Crowdsourcing was selected as a method to develop the dataset, because only human is able to translate abbreviated words into normal form of the words. From 1170 sentences that were tested, 1063 sentences were answered correctly while 107 sentences were answered incorrectly by the respondents. This research accuracy is about 90.85%. However, there is still a problem which occurred when the abbreviated word has more than one meaning/normal form, thus unique keywords are needed to determine which meaning is most accurate.","","978-1-7281-1655-6","10.1109/ICOIACT46704.2019.8938463","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8938463","text preprocessing;text normalization;crowdsourcing;text mining","Crowdsourcing;Text mining;Computers;Information and communication technology","","7","","27","IEEE","23 Dec 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In our presented system the user will place queries in the form of triplets. CoEx Deco is a system that will answer the user queries over a Simple Protocol and RDF Query Language (SPARQL) Query on Resource Description Framework (RDF) together obtaining data from crowd in form of triplet. We have made the user free to comment anything about a specific noun in form of triplet and our system will make a seamless integration of user entered data along with data collected from the crowd. In our presented system the user can enter the query in form of triplet and each triplet consists of a subject and an object, both labeled with a predicate. In other words we can say that the user can enter a query in the form of comments about a specific noun and each comment should contain these three things which are mentioned above. The query will be then executed and the user will get the desired results from the RDF database. RDF database is in the form of directed labeled graphs in which each edge represents a triplet. The graph matching technique is constructed by the patterns of triples. When a query is evaluated the input graph of RDF is matched against the inside variables of triple patterns. In this way the user can place more expressive queries which will be helpful in obtaining more accurate desired results.","","978-1-5090-1252-7","10.1109/ICECUBE.2016.7495258","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7495258","Semantic Association;Declarative CrowdSourcing;RDF;Information Extraction","Resource description framework;Crowdsourcing;Probabilistic logic;Database languages;Semantics;Relational databases","","6","","17","IEEE","23 Jun 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To generate the project's profile, our engine takes advantage of the information stored by students in the aforementioned platform. Content-based algorithms based on Okapi BM25 and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) are used to provide suitable recommendations.

The subjective experiment is one of the largest ever reported including more than 240 pair-comparisons evaluated by 118 naÃ¯ve subjects. The results of the benchmarking of learning-based image coding solutions against conventional codecs are organized in a dataset of differential mean opinion scores along with the stimuli and made publicly available.","2642-9357","978-1-7281-8551-4","10.1109/VCIP53242.2021.9675314","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9675314","deep learning;image coding;learning-based compression;subjective evaluation;visual quality;crowdsourcing","Crowdsourcing;Degradation;Image coding;Codecs;Visual communication;Transform coding;Benchmark testing","","5","","21","IEEE","19 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It is quite clear that smart cities systems generate vast amounts of data during their daily operation. Researchers typically focus on analyzing such urban data in order to identify mobility patterns or infer user preferences to provide services to the crowd, such as traffic warning applications.

One way to address this problem is to crowdsource monitoring of lakes to interested citizens. We investigated changes in a lake in Bangalore, India over three months and found that there was double digit percentage change in several chemical and physical parameters, confirming that frequent monitoring of lakes would be valuable. We went on to develop an integrated mobile phone app and lake monitoring kit consisting of an electronic sensing device and chemical test strips. The electronic device measures total dissolved solids, electrical conductivity, and temperature of a water sample, and transmits this data to a mobile app. The app also measures contaminant concentration levels of pH, Hardness, Alkalinity, Copper, and Nitrites by detecting color changes in chemical test strips. All data collected by the app is uploaded to a cloud platform that enables spatiotemporal visualizations of health parameters of multiple lakes. We validated that our first of a kind end-to-end lake monitoring system gives reliable data and initial crowdsourcing experiments showed that this approach could indeed provide valuable insights on the changing conditions of lakes.","","978-1-5090-4573-0","10.1109/CCEM.2016.037","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7819690","crowdsourcing;lakes;developing countries","Lakes;Image color analysis;Strips;Monitoring;Crowdsourcing;Water pollution","","4","","10","IEEE","19 Jan 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we describe and evaluate an android based application that uses crowdsourcing technique for generating bus schedules, even for short distance travel. The system uses the android accelerometer for detecting the bus stops. Then GPS is activated and the coordinates of the stop are sent to the server. The server runs a scheduling algorithm and updates the schedule. And whenever a user of the application enters the source and destination, the corresponding bus schedule will be displayed.

Usually, platform administrators collect and ratify vulnerability information, which white hat hackers report at first hand, and users hence know which applications have doubts via vulnerability reports published on the platform. However, there are still few reported but unverified vulnerabilities, which may be caused from scarcity of testing targets and limitation of man power. These vulnerabilities might agitate those users who have related applications. This study initiates crowdsourcing to vulnerability collection platforms. The proposed platform collaborates administrators with two new added roles, script writers and target providers, aiming at vulnerability verification. In addition we design two agents, the test scheduler and the log collector, to automatically arrange test cases and collect logs, respectively. With properly scoring on task assignment, these crowd sources can effectively and efficiently collaborate on verification of timely and severe vulnerabilities. Hence this platform can speed up the progress of vulnerability assessment in information security.","","978-4-88552-304-5","10.1109/APNOMS.2016.7737235","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7737235","crowdsourcing platform;collaboration management;vulnerability verification","Crowdsourcing;Servers;Collaboration;Computer hacking;Software","","2","1","19","","10 Nov 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The crowd is not affected by heterogeneous videos as the automatic processes are, so it is possible to use them to process videos and find the synchronization points. In order to make this process possible, a structure is described that can manage both crowd and video synchronization: the Dynamic Alignment List (DAL).

Accurate locations of disaster areas will help responders to create an appropriate response in reducing the impact of the disaster. Indonesian Geospatial Information Agency (BIG-Badan Informasi Geospasial) has made spatial data available for emergency response activities across the country. In 2011, BIG launched a geoportal, which is a part of National Spatial Data Infrastructure Network (NSDIN). For data related to the disaster, Indonesian National Board for Disaster Management (BNPB) handles them that is a part of the network. At the national level, the data are in medium and small scale and not suitable for operational purposes such as in disaster response. Indonesian law on geospatial information has ordered the local government to develop local SDI to solve it. In disaster response phase, the data should reflect the latest situation, complete and reliable. They should be available in a short time period. SDI has impediments to meet these criteria because it is built based on the authoritative perspective that is not agile. On the other side, crowds enrich and update data rapidly by utilizing web 2.0 technology (e.g. social media and map applications). This paper discusses existing SDI frameworks and crowdsourcing concepts in Indonesia and global levels to come up with a new framework that can comply with disaster response activities.","","978-1-5386-3111-9","10.1109/INAES.2017.8068577","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8068577","spatial data;spatial data infrastructure;crowdsourcing;emergency response","Spatial databases;Crowdsourcing;Geospatial analysis;Emergency services;Seminars","","2","","13","IEEE","16 Oct 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Our work showed that, with a crowdsourcing approach, even a very simple mobile app could make large-scale volunteer effort practical. Our application instructed the user step by step through the needed tasks to document an identified hazard. Each documented hazard was then automatically uploaded to a server. Such approach allowed nearly real-time coordination, and prevented duplicated effort. We cooperated with a local township, helping them to use our system to document hazards in their township. The volunteers recorded 349 distinct hazards in eight days. In total, eight volunteers participated. After a short period of training, all volunteers were able to complete the documentation tasks without issues, even though most of them were not familiar with the system before.

To do so, we assess and evaluate a number of linguistic quality factors such as grammaticality, non-redundancy, referential clarity, focus and structure & coherence. Our first results imply that referential clarity, focus and structure & coherence are the main factors effecting the perceived summary quality by crowdworkers. Further, we compare these results using an initial set of expert annotations that is currently being collected, as well as an initial set of automatic quality score ROUGE for summary evaluation. Preliminary results show that ROUGE does not correlate with linguistic quality factors, regardless if assessed by crowd or experts. Further, crowd and expert ratings show highest degree of correlation when assessing low quality summaries.

In this work, we first point out the shockwave phenomenon occurring in signalized traffic can be used to discover useful traffic information including traffic light information and vehicle flow information. To reduce the requirement on the penetration rate, a folding heuristic is proposed. The proposed concepts are verified via extensive simulations, especially on the penetration rate issue. Our results show that shockwave models are useful to extract traffic information from crowdsourced data, and the folding technique can effectively reduce the requirement on the penetration rate.

This paper proposes the use of mobile crowdsourcing in order to build a fingerprint database consisting of Wi-Fi networks received signal strength. The primary objective of this paper is to prove the feasibility of outdoor positioning using Wi-Fi crowdsourced data by showing that Wi-Fi networks are ubiquitous in urban areas. We then examine the gathered data and report our findings on challenges in building and maintaining a large-scale crowdsourced fingerprint database, the influence of fading on crowdsourced measurements.

To address this challenge, we first propose a Common Crucial Feature (CCF) detection algorithm to exclude unimportant visual features from crucial features. To achieve a good balance between the efficiency and accuracy, we further propose a CCF based Visual Hash Bits (VHB) scheme to encode CCF features into hash bits to vote for most matching images.

We propose to estimate time-varying RSS fields by a recursive Bayesian approach that operates on data of low accuracy and obtained by crowdsourcing. The method is based on Gaussian processes, and it produces as a result the complete joint distribution of the unknowns. We also inject a forgetting factor that reduces the effect of old information on current estimates. Our method summarizes all the acquired information, keeping the memory size needed for estimation fixed, i.e., making it independent from the number of sensing users.

The government consequently sets targets geared towards addressing societal concerns, but which do not often achieve desired results where such government endeavors are not in harmony with societal needs.

But the wide use of robots, such as Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV), can effectively alleviate the current problems in PCS. Lots of precision sensors can be installed into the robots, which makes sensory data collected by robots more trustful. However, the power and data transmission capability of robots are also limited.

The reliability of the labels may vary over different workers and tasks, and is characterized by a Gaussian mixture model. A federated truth inference (FTI) algorithm is proposed based on a distributed implementation of the block expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. The messages sent by each local platform to the central coordinator contain aggregates of workers' responses, instead of individual labels. The convergence of the FTI algorithm can be verified theoretically. A communication-efficient variant of the FTI scheme is also proposed by allowing the distributed platforms to perform multiple local EM computations before updating the global estimates at the central coordinator in each iteration.

In this context, âadequate instructionsâ means that workers will appropriately do the task if the workers read and understand the instructions. Instructions for workers should be easy to read and understand, but the requesters are hard to recognize whether the instructions are adequate or not. Therefore, we propose a method for measuring the ade-quateness of instructions using machine learning. We assume a labeling task for tweets. In our method, we construct the machine-learning model for each worker, which labels similar to the worker, which we call a âVirtual Worker.â Then, the machine-learning model labels do the tasks for all tweets. Finally, we calculate the kappa-values of this labeling. We assume that if an instruction is inadequate, the kappa values should be high. In our experiments, we found that our method can select adequate additional instruction.","","978-1-6654-5963-1","10.1109/BigMM55396.2022.00032","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9999099","","Crowdsourcing;Costs;Machine learning;Predictive models;Big Data;Data models;Labeling","","","","5","IEEE","29 Dec 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Rerunning the dataflow requires more time and incurs monetary costs for the additional work that would need to be completed by crowd workers. This time and cost may be reduced by reusing complete or intermediate results in the previous run. However, at times, such results cannot be used as is (e.g., when the dataflow has been changed), and some additional tasks need to be completed in the old dataflow in order to make them reusable in the new dataflow. The benefit of reusing these results in the previous run may or may not be worth the cost of these additional tasks. This paper gives a general framework for formulating this problem, and proposed a method to estimate the additional costs. The simulation result shows that it is worth devising optimization techniques to identify feasible (namely, cost-effective) plans.","","978-1-5386-5035-6","10.1109/BigData.2018.8622497","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8622497","Crowdsourcing;Dataflows;Optimization","Task analysis;Crowdsourcing;Optimization;Query processing;Switches;Estimation","","","","5","IEEE","24 Jan 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This premature convergence occurs due to a lack of speciation or diversity of the population of prospective solutions. To overcome premature convergence, increasing the diversity of the population of prospective solutions is necessary. Diversity makes genetic algorithms run smoothly to provide recommendations or personalize content in crowdsourcing media monitoring systems. This research attempts to overcome the premature convergence of genetic algorithms by adopting the CRISPR / Cas9 approach. CRISPR / Cas9 is a genome editing method that can edit targeted genes with template genes. The goal is to increase the diversity of the prospective solutions population, hoping that premature convergence does not occur. As a result, CRISPR / Cas9 has proven successful in overcoming premature convergence. However, more processing time and memory are needed than conventional genetic algorithms.","","978-1-6654-2404-2","10.1109/ICAICST53116.2021.9497833","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9497833","CRISPR/Cas9;Premature Convergence;Genetic Algorithms;Personalization;Content Recommendation","Crowdsourcing;Sociology;Memory management;Media;Indexes;Statistics;Monitoring","","","","12","IEEE","30 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

During that time, technologies to construct web sites have been evolved as well and, currently, AJAX is a representative technique to construct dynamic web pages. Crawling is a basic tool to collect information in the internet, and traditional crawling techniques randomly choose and follow links represented by the anchor tag in order to navigate the Word-Wide-Web. However, when a traditional crawler is applied for gathering information from a targeted up-to-date online market place, there are some critical problems. The first issue is that there are too many links, among which only few are enough to navigate all web pages in the site. The second issue is that most links are given by JavaScript but not by the anchor tags, which cannot be followed by the traditional web crawlers. Therefore, to overcome these issues, we suggest a webpage crawling method which can extract only necessary and sufficient links by adopting crowdsourcing approach and can follow JavaScript links by using a navigating information represented by XPaths.","2375-9356","978-1-4673-8796-5","10.1109/BIGCOMP.2016.7425956","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7425956","crowdsourcing;crawilng;xpath","Crawlers;Uniform resource locators;Web pages;Crowdsourcing;Data mining;Java;XML","","","","5","IEEE","7 Mar 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Existing approaches are unduly expensive and sensitive to user physique and biometrics. Additionally, most approaches were developed using limited, simulated fall data and often perform poorly in field tests. To resolve these issues, in this paper we propose an accurate, crowdsourcing-based, adaptive fall detection approach using smart devices with built in wireless connection and sensors. We adaptively refine the fall detection algorithm and user groupings for improved accuracy based on the real, crowdsourced data. Field tests show that our proposed approach improves fall detection accuracy rate to 97%, compared to 68% with other traditional approaches.","","978-1-5090-6117-4","10.1109/ICHI.2016.46","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7776362","","Detection algorithms;Smart devices;Conferences;Medical services;Informatics;Computer science;Health and safety","","","","","IEEE","8 Dec 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
