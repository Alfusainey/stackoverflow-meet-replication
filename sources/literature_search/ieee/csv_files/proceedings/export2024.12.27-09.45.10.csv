"How Do Users Answer MATLAB Questions on Q&A Sites? A Case Study on Stack Overflow and MathWorks","M. Naghashzadeh; A. Haghshenas; A. Sami; D.

Moreover, some MATLAB users ask their questions on SO. This paper aims to compare these two Q&A platforms to see what kind of questions are asked and how developers answer these questions in each platform. The result of our analysis on 80,382 MATLAB questions on SO and 266,367 questions on MathWorks show that MATLAB questions on topics ranging from the MATLAB software installation to questions related to programming received high votes and accepted answers on MathWorks. However, the questions about basics of programming such as plots, functions, and variables and questions on converting MATLAB code to other programming languages are very likely to receive answers on SO. Our detailed analysis on SO shows that users answer MATLAB questions with the same rate of the accepted answer as other popular programming languages like Java and Python, but the rate of unanswered questions and questions without an accepted answer for Simulink and the three most popular MATLAB toolboxes -- image processing, signal processing, and computer vision -- are very high. To analyze the evolution of MATLAB questions on SO, we studied 80,382 MATLAB questions using the SOTorrent dataset. The patterns in MATLAB questions’ evolution are: 1) Most of the revisions to questions are text-related and not on code snippets. 2) Most of the code-related revisions were performed by the original poster (OP). 3) Non-original posters (Non-OPs) usually revise code snippets’ appearance, while OPs usually revise code snippets’ content and logic.","1534-5351","978-1-7281-9630-5","10.1109/SANER50967.2021.00059","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9426047","MATLAB;Stack Overflow;MathWorks;code snippets;evolution;question;revision","Java;Computer vision;Software packages;Image processing;Programming;Signal processing;Tools","","1","","9","IEEE","11 May 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"Understanding the Factors for Fast Answers in Technical Q&A Websites: An Empirical Study of Four Stack Exchange Websites","S. Wang; T. -H. Chen; A. E. Hassan","Queen's University Faculty of Health Sciences, Kingston, ON, CA; Concordia University, Montreal, QC, CA; Queen's University Faculty of Health Sciences, Kingston, ON, CA",2018 IEEE/ACM 40th International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE),"2 Sep 2018","2018","","","884","884","Technical questions and answers (Q&A) websites accumulate a significant amount of knowledge from users. Developers are especially active on these Q&A websites, since developers are constantly facing new development challenges that require help from other experts. Over the years, Q&A website designers have derived several incentive systems (e.g., gamification) to encourage users to answer questions that are posted by others. However, the current incentive systems primarily focus on the quantity and quality of the answers instead of encouraging the rapid answering of questions. Improving the speed of getting an answer can significantly improve the user experience and increase user engagement on such Q&A websites. In this paper [1], we study the factors for fast answers on such Q&A websites. Our goal is to explore how one may improve the current incentive systems to motivate fast answering of questions. We use a logistic regression model to analyze 46 factors along four dimensions (i.e., question, asker, answer, and answerer dimension) in order to understand the relationship between the studied factors and the needed time to get an accepted answer. The question dimension calculates various textual and readability features of a question, as well as the popularity and difficulty of the question's tags. The asker dimension calculates the reputation of an asker and his/her historical tendency to get answers. The answer dimension computes textual features from the text of the accepted answer. The answerer dimension computes the historical activity level of the answerer who answered the question. We conduct our study on the four most popular (i.e., with the most questions) Q&A Stack Exchange websites: Stack Overflow, Mathematics, Ask Ubuntu, and Superuser. We find that i) factors in the answerer dimension have the strongest effect on the needed time to get an accepted answer, after controlling for other factors; ii) the current incentive system does not recognize non-frequent answerers who often answer questions which frequent answerers are not able to answer well. Such questions that are answered by non-frequent answerers are as important as those that are answered by frequent answerers; iii) the current incentive system motivates frequent answerers well, but such frequent answerers tend to answer short questions. Our findings suggest that the designers of Q&A website should improve their incentive systems to motivate non-frequent answerers to be more active and to answer questions faster, in order to shorten the waiting time for an answer (especially for questions that require specific knowledge that frequent answerers might not possess). In addition, the question answering incentive system needs to factor in the value and difficulty of answering the questions (e.g., by providing more rewards to harder questions or questions that remain unanswered for a long period of time).","1558-1225","978-1-4503-5638-1","10.1145/3180155.3182521","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8453164","Q&A website;Factor importance analysis;Response time","Software engineering;Software;Knowledge engineering;Computer science;Logistics;Analytical models;Mathematics","","9","","","","2 Sep 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Acknowledging that software developers routinely resort to open `question & answer' communities like Stack Overflow to seek advice on solving technical issues, we have performed an empirical study to investigate the extent, evolution and characteristics of Covid-19 related posts. Through the study of 464 Stack Overflow questions posted in February and March 2020 and leveraging the power of text mining, we attempt to shed light into the interest of developers in Covid-19 related topics and the most popular problems for which the users seek information. The findings reveal that indeed this global crisis sparked off an intense activity in Stack Overflow with most post topics reflecting a strong interest on the analysis of Covid- 19 data, primarily using Python technologies.","","978-1-7281-9532-2","10.1109/SEAA51224.2020.00086","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9226310","Covid-19;Stack Overflow;Data Analytics","COVID-19;Python;Feature extraction;Libraries;Software;Informatics;Data visualization","","6","","6","IEEE","16 Oct 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, many organisations have ignored the importance of knowledge sharing among employees within an organisation. Recently, organisational culture has emerged as a key factor influencing the extent of knowledge sharing between employees. This paper aims to investigate the role of specific dimensions of organisational culture in the success of knowledge sharing. One of these dimensions, suggested by Hofstede, examined the difference between means oriented and goal oriented organisational cultures. In a means oriented culture, people avoid taking risks, only exhibit a limited effort at their jobs and spend their time caught in a routine. In contrast, workers in a goal oriented culture tend to be concerned about what needs to be achieved, are willing to try new approaches and sometimes take risks. The current review investigated special relationships between knowledge sharing behaviours at the work place, with regard to means oriented and goals oriented organizational culture dimensions.","","978-0-7695-4967-5","10.1109/ITNG.2013.130","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6614390","Knowledge sharing;knowledge management;organizational culture;behavior;Hofstede;organizational culture dimensions;means oriented culture;goal oriented culture","Organizational aspects;Knowledge management;Companies;Cultural differences;Teamwork;Technological innovation","","1","","32","IEEE","30 Sep 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Based on the knowledge sharing model, this paper tries to find the rules of knowledge sharing among the enterprises inside and outside the alliance cliques. The results show that when there is no synergistic effect of knowledge between enterprises in cliques, there is a free rider behavior when enterprises choose cliques; When there is synergy effect, enterprises have strong willingness to get more innovative knowledge to enhance their innovative potential; However, with the increase of the cost of enterprise alliance, the enthusiasm of enterprises to choose alliance cliques gradually decreases.

A major challenge in Q&A sites is how to encourage user contribution. Theory of linguistic politeness informs us that politeness is able to ease the tension resulting from face-threatening acts (FTA), and it is applicable to Q&A sites. However, Stack Overflow (SO), one of the most popular Q&A site for programmers, denies the use of linguistic politeness (e.g., greetings, salutations, and gratitude expressions), aiming at building a nonsocial platform. This paper focuses on a specific politeness strategy-expressing gratitude-in Q&A sites, and examines its effect on answerers' future contributions from the aspects of quality.

However, there has been very little experimental work towards identifying a practitioner's needs on the implementation and understanding of RE activities and tasks. Therefore, in this paper, we use data from popular social Q&A sites (i.e. Stack Overflow, Programmers Stack Exchange, Project Management Stack Exchange, and Quora), and analyze 4,553 questions and answers to examine what requirements engineers' needs are and what they ask about. To this end, we applied Latent Dirichlet Allocation-based (LDA) topic models and statistical analysis to explore the main related topics to RE. Our findings show that software practitioners are asking about requirements communication, evolution, validation, and modelling. Furthermore, we determined common RE challenges and issues, identified the main types of questions practitioners ask (i.e. what, how, why, when, where, and RE domain), and categorized these questions based on various aspects of software products (e.g. functionality, quality, and release planning). Our findings help highlight the challenges facing requirements engineers that require more attention from the software engineering - specifically requirements and product engineering - research communities in the future and establish a novel approach for analyzing the content of social Q&A websites.","","978-1-5090-3694-3","10.1109/REW.2016.061","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7815644","","Software;Requirements engineering;Analytical models;Statistical analysis;Conferences;Project management;Mobile communication","","11","","15","IEEE","16 Jan 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Users can easily and quickly access high quality answers to common questions. The main mechanism to label good answers is to count the votes per answer. This mechanism, however, does not consider whether other answers were present at the time when a vote is given. Consequently, good answers that were given later are likely to receive less votes than they would have received if given earlier. In this paper we present a Weighted Votes (WV) metric that gives different weights to the votes depending on how many answers were present when the vote is performed. The idea behind WV is to emphasize the answer that receives most of the votes when most of the answers were already posted.

We perform snippet analysis to extract structural information from short plain-text snippets that are often found in Stack Overflow.

Three different settings were studied: two were e-learning environments-with knowledge-sharing blog, and without knowledge-sharing blog. The third was the traditional classroom environment. Results of the experiment showed that the value of sharing motivation for learning effectiveness was contingent upon the provision of knowledge-sharing. Students in the e-learning environment that provided knowledge-sharing blog achieved significantly better learning performance and a higher level of learner satisfaction than those in other settings. However, students who used the e-learning environment that provided without knowledge-sharing blog did not improve either.

The procedure is profoundly subject to individual associations among developers regarding contribute to the outcomes of MCR such as identifying alternative solutions, code improvement, and knowledge sharing. Knowledge sharing is supposed as an important outcome of MCR; however, developers involved in MCR activities are confronted with a lack of knowledge sharing challenge due to a dearth of knowledge sharing motivation. There are different individual factors that might encourage or hinder developers to engage in knowledge sharing. Studies have been performed dependent on information investigation gathered from surveys, interviews and review tools concerning elements affecting MCR, still the literature lacks research regarding factors impacting knowledge sharing aspect in MCR. Hence, this examination performs a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) that distinguish individual factors impacting knowledge sharing in MCR. The examination discoveries 34 individual factors such as biasness, cognitive load, time pressure, expertise, etc. The factors are grouped into 7 broad categories utilizing grounded theory.

We show that reference frequencies of URLs follow power law distribution, meaning that web resources that have been referenced frequently will likely to be referenced again. However, there lack of effective methods to manage and reuse already-shared web resources relevant to entities (e.g., APIs or programming concepts) that are mentioned in Q&A discussions. As URL references are done in an ad-hoc manner, large amounts of entity mentions have not been linked to relevant web resources. To enhance management and reuse of alreadyshared web resources in Stack Overflow, we build a knowledge base of official documentation of languages and APIs that have been shared in Stack Overflow, and develop an automatic web resources linking technique to linkify entity mentions to relevant official documentation in the knowledge base. A challenge in automatic web resources linking is that entity mentions often have ambiguity, for example, same programming concepts across different languages, same name APIs in different libraries. To disambiguate the right web resource to link among several URL candidates for an entity mention, our technique examines both the global popularity of the URL candidates for the entity mention and the local context relatedness of the URL candidates with the discussion thread in which the entity is mentioned. We conduct large scale evaluation of the built knowledge base and the performance of our automatic web resource linking technique.","","978-1-5386-2431-9","10.1109/ICECCS.2017.30","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8292806","","Uniform resource locators;Knowledge based systems;Documentation;Programming;Knowledge engineering;Libraries;Context","","4","","27","IEEE","15 Feb 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Knowledge sharing is crucial to the virtual enterprise. The case of knowledge sharing between two member enterprises without participant of hegemony enterprise has been discussed using Prisoner Dilemma Game Model. There are many factors may affect the strategy of member enterprise like utility of monopolizing the knowledge, the lost monopolizing benefit when sharing the knowledge and the cost of the knowledge sharing. The theory of complete and perfect two-stage dynamic game of knowledge sharing based on work competition model has been applied to the analysis on knowledge sharing in virtual enterprise. The member enterprise will choose knowledge sharing level to make marginal income equal to the value of negative utility by sharing its knowledge at Nash Equilibrium. The hegemony enterprise should formulate a reasonable stimulation policy and give enough bounty to the member enterprise who has contributed more knowledge to the virtual enterprise through knowledge sharing. There is a positive correlation between stimulation level and the variance of random item probability distribution of production function.","","978-0-7695-3729-0","10.1109/SSME.2009.134","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5233316","virtual enterprise;knowledge sharing;stimulation policy;game","Virtual enterprises;Costs;Conference management;Knowledge management;Technology management;Engineering management;Knowledge engineering;Game theory;Nash equilibrium;Probability distribution","","2","","6","IEEE","4 Sep 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Through a field survey of 322 employees from 13 industries of China, we confirm that intrinsic motivators, organizational commitment, organizational climate, and abilities of knowledge sharing are the important determinations of knowledge sharing behavior, where one's attitude toward knowledge sharing, subjective norm, and perceived behavioral control are identified as critical mediate variables.

But it is inconceivable to flourish knowledge sharing without individual's motivation to share his knowledge. Individuals are motivated through intrinsic as well as extrinsic motivators. Due to this reason researchers have underlined the importance of extrinsic rewards and Organization Citizenship Behavior (OCB) to influence individual's decision to share his knowledge. Extrinsic rewards dwell in extrinsic motivation whereas OCB represents intrinsic motivation. The relationships of these variables with knowledge sharing have been tested in past research works, however there are a number of limitations which need to be addressed. Using the case of training institutes of an oil and Gas Company in Malaysia, the aim of the study is to propose a framework of intrinsic and extrinsic motivators of knowledge sharing. The proposed framework will overcome the limitations in the literature by revisiting the impact of extrinsic rewards and OCB on knowledge sharing. The proposed framework has incorporated intrinsic (OCB) and extrinsic motivators (extrinsic rewards) in the Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA). Five major and in total 15 hypotheses have been tested. The data was gathered from the knowledge workers, working as trainers and facilitators, at three training institutes of an oil and gas company. Questionnaire method was used to gather data. Later the data was tested using regression analysis through SPSS. The results have shown that OCB is a very strong predictor of knowledge sharing behavior, whereas extrinsic reward's affect on individual's intention to share his knowledge is moderate. The study will help us to understand the role of individual's intrinsic (i.e. OCBs) and extrinsic motivators (i.e. extrinsic rewards) to affect his decision to share his knowledge. The study will also help the theorists and practitioners to develop strategies to foster knowledge sharing in their organizations.","2155-899X","978-1-4244-6718-1","10.1109/ITSIM.2010.5561519","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5561519","Knowledge Sharing;extrinsic rewards;OCB;extrinsic motivation;intrinsic motivation","Training;Companies;Petroleum;Psychology;Humans;Book reviews","","2","","35","IEEE","2 Sep 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We view knowledge sharing as a process that comprises awareness and transfer. Knowledge sharing mechanism determines in what forms the knowledge is represented and through what intermediate steps it flows from one end to the other. Two dimensions, namely “Reach” and “Richness” characterize the nature of knowledge sharing mechanisms. In this study, empirical evidence proves that mechanisms used at stage awareness are more likely to have a high degree of “Reach” while mechanisms used at stage transfer are more likely to have a high degree of “Richness”. Additionally, it is hypothesized that using a mechanism with high “Reach” is more likely to be effective at stage awareness of knowledge sharing while at stage transfer, use of mechanisms with high “Richness” creates higher efficacy.

The knowledge sharing between these two types of open source communities can be very beneficial to both of them. However, it is a great challenge to automate this process. Current studies mainly focus on knowledge acquisition in one type of community, and few of them have tackle this problem efficiently. In this paper we take Android Issue Tracker and Stack Overflow as a case to study automatic knowledge sharing between them. We propose an automatic approach by integrating semantic similarity with temporal locality between Android issues and Stack Overdo posts to reveal the potential associations between them. Our approach exploits the rich semantics in fine-grained information of issues and posts for associations building, and explores the temporal correlations between issues and posts in-depth for associations ranking. Extensive experiments show that the precision of our approach reaches 54.82% for top 10 recommendations when recommending Stack Overflow posts to Android issues, and 66.83%in reverse.

The lack of ability to share knowledge over time, in globally distributed software organizations, is perhaps the most prominent issue of this digital era. Traditionally, the main focus of the existing literature for knowledge sharing has been on individuals working from same locations rather than globally distributed locations. Therefore, a good amount of research work needs to be done to understand knowledge sharing process for globally distributed software development organizations. To fill this gap, this paper proposes a framework consisting of knowledge sharing factors classified into five main categories “individual”, “organizational”, “technological”, “cultural” and “geographical”. The proposed framework incorporates psychological theories including theory of planned behavior (TPB), social cognitive theory (SCT) and subset of Triandis' theory of interpersonal behavior (TIB). Based on literature review, this study suggests that trust, motivation, social interaction, linguistic distance, geographical distance, time zone difference have direct relationships with knowledge sharing behavior whereas organizational and technological support plays a moderating role.","","978-1-5090-4752-9","10.1109/ISCAIE.2017.8074972","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8074972","knowledge sharing behavior;global software development organizations;motivation;geographical distance;linguistic distance","Software;Organizations;Cultural differences;Standards organizations;Pragmatics;Information security;Technological innovation","","2","","41","IEEE","19 Oct 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Although Software Engineering is a growing field, however research done in this profession is still not mature. One of the areas, which have not been thoroughly investigated in this profession, is working environment and its impact on knowledge sharing. Focus on this aspect of Software Engineering is important because work environment not only influences the performance of an individual but also the behavior (which in this case will be knowledge sharing behavior). Therefore, huge number of studies has been done conducted on designing work environment. One of the important works done was Job Characteristics Model (mostly used in Software Engineering field). However, it covers only five aspects of work/job. Therefore different other studies focused on more work design characteristics. This study analyzed the relationship between knowledge sharing behavior and work design characteristics among Software Engineers. Work design characteristics proposed by Morgeson and Humphrey (2006) were used for this study. This study was conducted in Malaysia and four locations were selected through geographical random cluster sampling. Results indicated that task identity, feedback from job, skill variety and received interdependence are the main work design characteristics for Software Engineers. Results also indicated that all work design characteristics has positive relationship with knowledge sharing behavior.","","978-1-4799-4390-6","10.1109/ICCOINS.2014.6868447","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6868447","Work Design Characteristics;Knowledge Sharing Behavior;Software Engineers","Software;Knowledge engineering;Software engineering;Organizations;Problem-solving;Information processing;Complexity theory","","2","","9","IEEE","31 Jul 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This very idea urges business executors to conduct an innovation, mainly for the medium scale to be able to compete with the big one. In dealing with obstacles, the owner of Small and Medium Enterprises (SME) must be able to innovate in order to elevate competitiveness. The innovation process being done evidently cannot be separated from human resource within the organization. The innovation process within an organization will require new knowledge, therefore knowledge sharing between individuals inside the organization and between involving stakeholders will be needed. Knowledge sharing is vital as one of the main components in open innovation process. This notion shows that knowledge sharing needs to be well-managed so that SME can perform open innovation process optimally. Current business competition demands SME to perform an innovation which involves all-existing stakeholders in order to increase its potential from the aspect of economy, social, as well as culture. The output of this research is a model construction in which two endogenous constructs i.e. knowledge sharing and open innovation are synthesized. The exogenous constructs for knowledge sharing include communication and interaction, learning, culture of the environment, relationship, motivation, nature of knowledge, and opportunity of share. While for open innovation, the exogenous constructs consist of organization system, market demand/need, networking, stakeholders, innovation capability, type of technology, and human resource readiness.","","978-1-5090-1500-9","10.1109/ICMIT.2016.7605041","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7605041","Knowledge Sharing;Open Innovation;SME","Technological innovation;Organizations;Stakeholders;Economics;Knowledge transfer;Collaboration","","1","","14","IEEE","24 Oct 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we firstly analyze the cause of free-ride phenomenon and the key to solving the problem in team knowledge sharing. The free-ride phenomenon depends on the characteristics of business organization, both inside and outside environment of organization and the characteristics of knowledge. The key solution to this problem lies in how to design incentive coefficient. By setting the secondary principals (supervisors), the manager can strengthen the supervision management of team, assess effectively personal contribution of every team member and give corresponding fair return to each member. Thus it can make that the optimal choice of each employee in team is sharing knowledge actively. On the basis of secondary principal-agent model, we discuss the team scale further.

The forum is built with the MERN stack, which includes MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js. Several NLP strategies were implemented in the project, including feature vectorization using count vectorizer, TF-IDF vectorizer, and word2vec. Logistic regression (LR), support vector machines (SVM), decision trees (DT), and naive Bayes (NB) are the ML methods used to detect hate speech. The classification report is used as an evaluation metric to assess the performance of these methods. For model training, the “Hate Speech and Offensive Language Dataset” hosted on Kaggle and freely accessible to the public is used. The findings of the experiments show that the LR model with the count vectorizer performs better than the other model and provides a maximum accuracy of 90%.","","979-8-3503-1120-4","10.1109/WCONF58270.2023.10235146","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10235146","Natural Language Processing;Hate Speech Detection;Sentiment Analysis;MERN Stack","Support vector machines;Training;Measurement;Machine learning algorithms;Computational modeling;Hate speech;User-generated content","","","","15","IEEE","4 Sep 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We apply our approach to millions of java/android-tagged Stack overflow questions and answers and discover a large scale of controversial discussions in Stack Overflow.

Knowledge sharing is the interaction between subjects, the study on it should be directed to the relationship they are building. Computer-based survey is a better way to gather relationship data than traditional paper-and-pencil survey. Although it has limitations, it has the advantages over other methods such as easy anchoring, high adaptivity, Good security, convenient networking. Then this paper takes an 8-person team as an example. The design of computer-base survey system ensures that each member of the team can evaluate his/her knowledge sharing behavior with every specific person. Also, the computer-based survey can form the social network through the backstage data gathered.","","978-1-4244-5244-6","10.1109/ICCIT.2009.282","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5369879","Knowledge Sharing;Relationship Data;Computer-based Survey","Knowledge management;Information technology;Psychology;Buildings;Data security;Computer networks;Social network services;Knowledge transfer;Writing;Books","","","","19","IEEE","31 Dec 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The respondents expressed positive perceptions towards sharing knowledge through academic networks, personal outcome expectations, and social outcome expectations. Although the analysis of demographic variables indicated mean differences in knowledge sharing, perceived personal outcome expectations, and social outcome expectations, the results of t-tests and ANOVA tests revealed that the mean score differences are not statistically significant (P values >0.05). However, the findings of the Study indicated a significant impact of perceived personal outcome expectations and perceived social expectations on knowledge sharing. The findings of the study demonstrated theoretical contribution by using Social Cognitive Theory. The empirical evidence showed that POEs and SOEs can be the major motivators in motivating students to share knowledge through academic social networks.","2831-7343","979-8-3503-1890-6","10.1109/SNAMS60348.2023.10375418","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10375418","Academic social networks;Knowledge sharing;Personal outcome expectations;Social outcome expectations;Motivation;Social Cognitive Theory","Knowledge engineering;Social networking (online);Security;Analysis of variance","","","","19","IEEE","2 Jan 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Many previous studies have studied the relationship between self-determination theory and knowledge sharing behavior. However, there has not been sufficient discussion of cases in which knowledge sharers are disadvantaged by knowledge sharing, or at the very least, are negatively psychologically burdened and fearful. For this reason, this paper limits itself to knowledge sharing in “learning from failure” and discusses the motivations in such knowledge sharing activities. Among these needs, autonomy and competency promote willingness to participate in organizational failure learning activities when the activities are consistent with organizational direction, whereas relatedness may not.","","978-1-6654-3771-4","10.1109/IEEM50564.2021.9672903","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science(grant numbers:17K03872,19K03062); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9672903","Organizational learning from failure;knowledge sharing motivation;self-determination theory","Engineering management;Conferences;Psychology;Companies;Industrial engineering","","","","22","IEEE","19 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, this human knowledge has lesser or no value when it is isolated or individualized; hence knowledge sharing becomes critical for the success of software projects. The dilemma with knowledge sharing is that there are many impediments to it. One such impediment can be occupational stress which has increased after the globalization of software engineering.

The rapid growth of data and technologies trigger the transformation of data to useful information known as `Knowledge'. To leverage knowledge, institutions need a knowledge sharing network that can meet the demands of changing knowledge. The knowledge sharing network is accomplished by sharing and capturing knowledge among faculty members and students. Info-Ca-Sh is a dynamic web content knowledge portal. The architecture serves as an information exchange of knowledge by using various open source tools. The tacit and explicit knowledge of the registered users are made codified and accumulated as knowledge repository. The various documents uploaded on the portal by the registered users are made share and capture. The implementation creates interests among faculty members to share and to capture information by exploring a social network. The result of social network analysis shows the information flow and degree of knowledge sharing in the network.","","978-1-4577-1583-9","10.1109/ICCCI.2012.6158906","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6158906","Knowledge Management;Repository;codification;Social Networking","Portals;Knowledge engineering;Social network services;Databases;Communities;Knowledge management;Lattices","","6","","12","IEEE","1 Mar 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In our proposed algorithm, several learner members are trained simultaneously on sub sets of original feature spaces. Every agent is trained using the same baseline algorithm such as Artificial Neural Network (ANN). In each knowledge sharing session the colony of agents calculates difficulty of each of the training samples and accordingly changes weight distribution over training data space based on a probabilistic metric. Finally, for classification purpose, the decisions of all the agents are conglomerated based on a novel variant of majority voting. Based on voting protocol, we present three different ensemble learning algorithms. Extensive simulations performed on samples from Color FERET and UCI databases reveal that our algorithm outperforms traditional non cooperative boosting algorithms and some recent variants of collaborative boosting algorithms in terms of training error convergence rate, classification accuracy, and resiliency against labeling noise. Furthermore, error-diversity relationships of the ensemble learners are investigated using Kappa-Error diagrams. The results are promising.","","978-1-4799-7458-0","10.1109/ICAPR.2015.7050684","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7050684","Collaborative Learning;AdaBoost;Kappa-Error diagram;Ensemble Classifier;Supervised Learning","Boosting;Training;Accuracy;Heart;Hafnium;Measurement","","2","","21","IEEE","2 Mar 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Positive affect like joy, happiness, contentment, interest and enthusiasm have been largely neglected in both basic and applied disciplines that deal with affect. A lot of researchers pay attention to study on negative affect; this is because positive affect poses more difficulties in information systems research. Hence a lot of models on affect that were developed neglected the role of positive affect in these studies. As more research works focus on different states of affect by Information Systems researchers, this provides us with strong basis to justify and rationalize the need to consider states of affect in our research works.

However, there leaves the impacts of heterogeneousness of suppliers' roles having not been deeply analyzed. Following the research on supplier's role and knowledge sharing in supply chains, this paper discusses the influence of supplier's role on knowledge assignment/sharing between the assembler and the supplier. At first, we focus on the natures of product parts and analyze the quantity of technological knowledge about the parts the assembler should know. Then, we analyze the assignment of the architectural knowledge (about how to assembly parts to a final product) and the component-specific knowledge (about how to produce a part) in the chain. Finally, we construct the supplier's roles by both the nature of parts he produces and the extent he involves in the part development, and analyze the relationship between the supplier's role and knowledge sharing in the chain..","","978-1-4244-5325-2","10.1109/ICMSS.2010.5576164","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5576164","","Supply chains;Complexity theory;Outsourcing;Industries;Product development;Knowledge transfer;Organizations","","","","24","IEEE","16 Sep 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To fill the gap, this research proposes the use of framing theory to understand how different expressions of goals influence responses. Cues of questions were used to identify goal-frames in CQA questions. Social network analysis was used to construct response networks whose nodes represent postings and connections represent responses. Our results reveal that goal-frames with high complexity, high specificity, and rewards tend to increase the centrality of questions. In contrast, low complexity and low specificity tend to generate extensive conversations. Implications for both researchers and practitioners are discussed in the final section.

Furthermore, we empirically observe how interactions evolve as a course advances, and note that while the network progressively shrinks because low-performing nodes drop out, it also becomes a more tight-knit community.

In the last decade, popularity of such services has increased noticeably. Large number of unanswered questions is a major problem for the growth of such services. A common way to address this issue is to route a new question to some selected users who have the potentiality in answering the question. Expert finding is the process of selecting such potential answerers. In this article, we have introduced an efficient method for expert finding using the theme in query likelihood language (QLL) model. Theme of a query is nothing but its subject matter and we have decided it based on the parts of speech (POS) of the words in the query. Depending on the theme of the given question, its similarity to a question in the archive is determined using the QLL model. Aggregating the similarity values of the questions a user answered previously (i.e., in the archive), his/her expertise for the given question is obtained. The performance of the proposed method is verified on a real world dataset (obtained from Yahoo! Answers) and it is found to be quite encouraging.","","978-1-4673-6911-4","10.1109/ICACEA.2015.7164742","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7164742","theme;community question answering;query likelihood language model;expert finding;Yahoo!

The task of annotating tags to question cannot be entirely left on users because sometimes it may happens that user who asks the question do not know the accurate tags for the question being asked. Questions with correct and accurate tags are informative and likely to get good answers. In this paper, we present a model to automatically provide tags to a question asked. We considered the problem of annotating tags to a question as a multi-label classification task. Multi-label classification is implemented to formulate question tagging as it allows adding multiple labels to a single instance.

Distinctive methods and methodologies are used in such sites for identifying best answers and ranking the quality answers. We identified two major problems in leading CQA sites. The first problem is majority of best answers identified by CQA sites are from the users who already had many followers. The second is if a question is posted and if the best answer is written by a user late after many answer, the probability of the answer getting ranked as top answer with high rank is very less. This paper introduces RewardRank algorithm to rank the answers provided by users in CQA sites. The RewardRank algorithm treats users with more followers and less followers equally. Also, the answer written at various time intervals by different users is also treated equally. On short ranking is based on only quality of answers.

Recently, there are some methods mining the authoritative users who focus on the quality of the answers provided. However, the contents of answers vary a lot and will become complex if they include images or videos, which makes the works hardly can be applied in real-time applications. To address this issue, this proposal aims to mine the most authoritative answer providers, which has attracted considerable research attentions recently. In particular, we first construct a graph with every asker or answer provider being a vertex and their relationships being edges, and then propose a novel approach to compute an appropriate weight for each answer provider based on the PageRank algorithm widely used in social network search area for ranking the users preferred answers on the top. Finally, we will rank the top authoritative answer providers according to their weights to obtain the most influence ones.

Due to the high variance of question quality and answer quality, users have to spend lots of time on finding the truly best answers from retrieved results. In this paper, we develop an answer retrieval and summarization system which directly provides an accurate and comprehensive answer summary instead of a list of similar questions to user's query. To fully explore the information of relations between queries and questions, between questions and answers, and between answers and sentences, we propose a new probabilistic scoring model to distinguish high-quality answers from low-quality answers.

Recently, with accumulation of users and contents, much concern has arisen over the efficiency and answer quality of CQA services. To address this problem, question routing has been proposed which aims at routing new questions to suitable answerers, who have both high possibility and high ability to answer the questions. In this paper, we formulate question routing as a multi-objective ranking problem, and present a multi-objective learning-to-rank approach for question routing (MLQR), which can simultaneously optimize the answering possibility and answer quality of routed users. In MLQR, realizing that questions are relatively short and usually attached with tags, we first propose a tagword topic model (TTM) to derive topical representations of questions. Based on TTM, we then develop features for each question-user pair, which are captured at both platform level and thread level. In particular, the platform-level features summarize the information of a user from his/her history posts in the CQA platform, while the thread-level features model the pairwise competitions of a user with others in his/her answered threads. Finally, we extend a state-of-the-art learning-to-rank algorithm for training a multi-objective ranking model. Extensive experimental results on real-world datasets show that our MLQR can outperform state-of-the-art methods in terms of both answering possibility and answer quality.","2375-026X","978-1-5386-5520-7","10.1109/ICDE.2018.00240","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8509461","Community question answering services;question routing;multiple objective optimization","Routing;Knowledge discovery;Feature extraction;Training;Optimization;Resource management;History","","1","","9","IEEE","25 Oct 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Now a day's quick distribution/sharing of knowledge and information is possible using information technology methods. This paper illustrates different methods based on information technology used for knowledge sharing in education systems. These methods are available over internet. This paper also focuses study of faculties age verses use of knowledge sharing methods in education systems.","","978-1-5386-3702-9","10.1109/ICCTCT.2018.8551044","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8551044","Knowledge;Knowledge sharing;Information technology","Knowledge engineering;Organizations;Education;Information technology;Tools;Social network services;Conferences","","5","","11","IEEE","29 Nov 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Many people join these communities to share experiences and ask for advices. Since ldquosharing one's original experience is the fundamental source of tacit knowledgerdquo [p.670], it is possible that online community users from all over the world are sharing their tacit knowledge while they are revealing their personal experiences and advices in their discussion threads. Moreover, since many online communities allow their users to embed images within their messages, it is interesting to find out how people use images to share tacit knowledge online. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to investigate the image usage and tacit knowledge sharing in online communities. The research method used in this study was content analysis. The findings suggest that online community users embed digital images in their messages to aid their tacit knowledge sharing.","","978-0-7695-3538-8","10.1109/ICC.2009.75","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5328176","","Internet;Yarn;Digital images;Knowledge engineering;Joining processes;Communities;Books;Humans;X-ray imaging;Video sharing","","4","","15","IEEE","17 Nov 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The methodology is based on development of RDF/RDFS and application of the Jena API. The contribution of this study has two facets: (a). It extends the bookmark tool into Web-based for knowledge sharing; (b). It consists of intelligent algorithm in terms of recommendations of new information allocation by matching the existing domain ontology.

However, the sheer volume of posts in such forums can threaten the quality of discussion and the ability of instructors to provide timely evaluations. To address this issue, an automated post-rating system has been developed utilizing a BERT-based AI model. This system evaluates learners' posts and provides prompt categorization outcomes into three categories: non-informative, informative, and neutral, within 10 seconds. Our model demonstrated appropriate accuracy in assessing the information density in forum posts, indicating potential benefits for both learners and instructors. Specifically, it achieved 67%, 68%, and 75% accuracy rates for posts categorized as discussion, comment, and reply, respectively. To assess the effectiveness of the system, it was tested and evaluated using two courses, “Python Programming” and “Introduction to AI,” through the use of a questionnaire. Results revealed that learners held positive evaluations of the system, noting improvements in post quality, reduced plagiarism, and enhanced comprehension.

Today, people are working in a collaborative environment to explore the ever increasing data and have new insights for knowledge sharing. Analyzing these needs we have proposed a system that finds the most appropriate and relevant documents based on the search query. In this system relevancy of document is supported by expert search method. In expert search, various aspects such as author name, hit count (number of downloads) of document, time span of hit count and last hit to that document are considered and clustering of retrieved results with meaningful cluster labels are identified to find whether a search term is used in the intended sense in that document. In this system, documents uploaded by members are analyzed. After analysis, indexing of documents is done. Further based on search query documents are retrieved and labeled clusters of documents are formed. Finally expert search is applied over mined results. This system helps in getting exact knowledge with quick response and repeating efforts for finding same information can be avoided with efficient time utilization. The performance of proposed system is evaluated with respect to response time of system. Thus, the effective use of knowledge sharing (data/information) is achieved with the Expert Search for time efficient systems.","","978-1-5090-3404-8","10.1109/ETIICT.2017.7977011","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7977011","","Collaboration;Data mining;Search problems;Fertilizers","","","","19","IEEE","13 Jul 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Thus, peers on the platform dissuade other users to post low quality content by closing, disliking or not answering their questions. The aggressive attitude of the community leads to a negative impact on the users' experience (especially for newbies) and the users tend to lose interest in the platform. Since the quality management on KS platforms is a necessity, we aim to emphasize the need of a mechanism to help users in improving their questions. To study this, we perform experiments on the Stack Overflow (SO) platform, however, the study can be adapted for other KS platforms.The SO community aggressively mark questions, even with slightest deformity, as closed. The non-triviality of reopening process and the rigorous review mechanism can be handled only by proper editing of the closed questions. Thus we present first-of-a-kind study, to assist the SO platform users, in the reopening process of their closed questions. We build predictive models to suggest the users that if their edited version of closed question will lead to a successful reopen or not. This can assist users at large by retracting them from entering the review process with improper edits. To learn these models effectively, we consider the user categories on the platform, based on their reputation: established & non-established. In addition to being the major contributor to closed questions, the non-established users have lower odds of getting their closed questions reopened than established users. Thus, we leverage the better editing skills of established users to learn question edit models by employing their reopened closed questions. We present the results of predictive model and suggest insights on the useful edits in the reopening process on the SO platform.","","978-1-5386-3120-1","10.1109/ICBK.2017.25","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8023393","question improvement;stack overflow;knowledge sharing platforms;reopen questions","Predictive models;Guidelines;Intelligent systems;Electronic mail;Internet;Knowledge discovery;Reactive power","","3","","35","IEEE","31 Aug 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Developing software at offshore locations offers many benefits including access to skilled human resource and high quality software development at low cost. However outsourcing is not a risk free business for both vendor and client organizations. Vendor organizations need to address a number of factors for successful outcomes of the outsourcing relationships. Likewise knowledge sharing management (KSM) plays an important role in OSDO relationships. This research seeks to explore KSM in the context of OSDO relationships from vendors' perspective. The objective is to identify the factors that can play a positive or negative role in KSM by reviewing the literature in a systematic way. Systematic Literature Review (SLR) is based on a structured protocol, and is therefore, different from ordinary literature review. SLR provides in-depth, more thorough and comparatively unbiased results than ordinary literature review. We have developed a SLR protocol for the KSM, and are in the process of implementing the protocol. The expected outcomes of this review will be the identification of critical success factors and critical barriers to be addressed by vendor organizations for enhancing KSM in the context of OSDO relationships.","","978-1-4577-1531-0","10.1109/MySEC.2011.6140718","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6140718","Systematic Literature Review;Knowledge Sharing Management;Software Development Outsourcing;Client-Vendor Relationships","Outsourcing;Software;Programming;Organizations;Knowledge transfer","","4","","20","IEEE","26 Jan 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Since all these people want to develop, test, architect software, and are reluctant to document it, a lot of this knowledge remains tacit. This is the more so in agile environments, where there is an inherent tension between top-down development guidance through specifications and other means, and a bottom-up development and delivery of new features. In multi-site development, such may easily lead to mutual misunderstandings, an increase in errors and problem reports, and wasting resources on rework.

This is a crucial knowledge-intensive process for organizations, but in most cases it is addressed in an ad hoc manner. The existence of a systematic approach for the development of new or improvedI SRM methodologies would enhance the effectiveness of the process. In this paper we propose a systematic meta-process for developing new, or improved ISRM methods.

Besides, this study also examined whether task type moderates the proposed mediational processes. Results of a study of 386 employees in 76 teams show that task conflict has positive effects on team KS through TMS. More interestingly, it is found that the task conflict-TMS-KS sequence only significant when task type is nonroutine rather than it is routine. Relationship conflict has a negative effect on team KS through TMS.

To analyze event logs, using intrusion detection systems and active network monitoring, honeynets are being deployed to attract potential attackers in order to investigate their modus operandi. The goal is to use honeynet clusters as real-time warning systems in production networks. Towards satisfying this objective, we have built a honeynet cluster and have run experiments to determine its effectiveness. Majority of the honeynets function in isolation, not sharing information in real time. In order to rectify this deficiency, the authors built a federation of cooperating honeynets (referred to as knowledge sharing honeynets) that shares knowledge of malicious traffic.

KS is an organized attempt to accelerate sharing of knowledge and experiences, in any format, among individuals or groups. However, in many situations, people in organizations avoid sharing their knowledge. Prior studies show that existing knowledge in organizations is not being effectively shared. This is mainly because of insufficient understanding of factors influencing attitudes towards KS among individuals. According to theses studies, the lack of motivation for sharing knowledge is the main factor that could probably impede KS intention. As there are some limitations in the existing research in this field, in this study the Theory of Reasoned Action, Social Exchange Theory and Flow Theory were mainly used to make a theoretical model to investigate factors influencing intentions towards KS.","","978-1-4673-0654-6","10.1109/ICIMTR.2012.6236419","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6236419","Knowledge management;Knowledge sharing;Theory of Reasoned Action;Flow Theory;Social Exchange Theory","Organizations;Educational institutions;Humans;Knowledge management;Technological innovation;Electronic mail","","2","","26","IEEE","12 Jul 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Therefore, the opponent reverts rationally through a counterargument. The proponent then removes the contradictions and proposes subsequent argument to the opponent.

However, the problem of locating and matching appropriate knowledge resources from across organisational boundaries to various tasks within specific e-Work projects remains a huge challenge. This often stems from lack of collective trust among virtual teams and the high value which organisations attach to knowledge as an asset of competitive advantage. In this paper, we present an approach for task-centred knowledge sharing in e-Collaboration. Our approach uses task-aware knowledge element models for locating and matching knowledge resources for specific e-Work tasks, and a work context tree for contextually determining the semantics of knowledge resources at different levels. We illustrate the approach using e-Workbench – a prototype adaptive collaborative e-Work support system based on the Knowledge Grid.","","978-1-4244-5402-0","10.1109/DeSE.2009.28","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5395156","","Collaborative work;Large-scale systems;Grid computing;Knowledge management;Resource management;Virtual groups;Context modeling;Prototypes","","1","","18","IEEE","22 Jan 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This service can be regarded as implementing a single global rule-based expert system on the Web, and it has an uncertainty problem in rule reasoning, as in existing expert systems. In the existing rule-based systems, the uncertainty problem can be mostly resolved at the design and development stage, but in the shared rules service, the problem inevitably arises because rules are freely written and shared by various users. In this paper, we analyze the uncertainty problem and explain that the problem can be resolved using existing methods.","2375-9356","978-1-5386-7789-6","10.1109/BIGCOMP.2019.8679451","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8679451","semantic web;knowledge sharing;RIF;shared rules;uncertainty problem;single global expert system","Cognition;Uncertainty;Resource description framework;Expert systems;Ontologies;OWL;Redundancy","","1","","9","IEEE","4 Apr 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The MailKnowledge has some knowledge indexes that include: (1) human-relationship indexes, (2) who-knows-what indexes, (3) meeting related mail indexes and (4) similar thread indexes. Using these indexes, user can retrieve some knowledge such as human relationship, finding key person and document management. Although the knowledge retrieval performance is not as good as more integrated knowledge management systems, the easy-to-adopt feature of the approach should be welcomed by busy organizations.","","0-7803-9035-0","10.1109/AMT.2005.1505268","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1505268","","Knowledge management;National electric code;Document delivery;Postal services;Electronic mail;Yarn;Humans;Computer applications;Collaborative software;Collaborative work","","","","10","IEEE","12 Sep 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Electronic health records (EHRs) with rich medical knowledge have gained increasing popularity for supporting E-health. Blockchain-based secure storage and access are novel trends for EHRs, but there are still following unresolved problems in this area. On one hand, specific medical tasks (e.g., COVID-19 diagnosis) require corresponding EHRs, but it lacks the medicine knowledge graph to help doctors or researchers find the EHRs on-demand in the massive distributed and encrypted medical data. On the other hand, as the documents include knowledge, EHRs with digital copyrights shared by medical institutions or patients need to be protected during sharing. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a blockchain and Non-Fungible Token (NFT) empowered on-demand medicine knowledge sharing architecture for EHRs. First, we propose a medicine knowledge graph construction scheme based on smart contracts and medical task knowledge relationships. Second, to provide on-demand EHRs sharing, we design the EHRs matching and clustering algorithms, regarding the dynamic importance and similarity of graph nodes. Third, we establish the interplanetary file address driven NFT minting mechanism for EHRs to protect digital copyrights. Finally, we conduct experiments in Ethereum using real medical datasets, which demonstrates the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed architecture.

Second, the domain shift problem still exists during the transfer from semantic space to visual space. In this paper, we introduce knowledge sharing (KS) to enrich the representation of semantic features. Based on KS, we apply a generative adversarial network to generate pseudo visual features from semantic features that are very close to the real visual features.

Network communities enabled people to not only provide and absorb information but also share and create information. Among the various kind of network communities, online forums are the ones in which information exchange takes place most frequently. The participation of forum members differs from forum to forum. According to past literature, personal features and characteristics play a major role when participating in online forums. Those who show a more stable personality (e.g., agreeableness, conscientiousness, extraversion, or openness to experience) are more willing to participate in group activities. Hence, this research utilizes the Nonaka and Konno (1998) proposal of Knowledge Spiral (SECI) and an environment of space that can enhance information exchange (ba), such as online forums, to explore how forum members with different personal characteristics share and create knowledge. The research proved from past literature that people with a more stable personalities (i.e., conscientiousness > extraversion > agreeableness) are more willing to share knowledge. Moreover, this research found that different levels of stability found in different personalities present a significant difference in knowledge sharing behaviors (F = 4.775, p = 0.011) even though the results are not influenced by the inclusion of few unstable personality traits, such as neuroticism (F = 5.219, p = 0.007). Finally, a qualitative analysis regarding knowledge creation in forums proves that most forum members display highly stable personalities.","","978-8-9886-7827-5","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5568695","","Correlation;World Wide Web;Artificial neural networks;Databases","","","","25","","9 Sep 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The non-independent and identically distribution (non-IID) of user data brings great challenges to FL, which may cause the global model to converge slowly or even deviate from the optimal solution. As an effective method to solve the data non-IID problem, knowledge distillation often relies on public proxy datasets for model training, which violates the original intention of FL to protect privacy. In this paper, we propose a global knowledge sharing algorithm without out-of-domain data to solve FL with non-IID data. Firstly, to ensure that the data remains within the domain and to constrain the deviation of update directions between the local and global models, we propose a novel teacher-student network structure, which utilizes a personalized global knowledge transfer method to supervise local training. Secondly, we also design different knowledge transfer loss functions to maximize the use of global knowledge and prevent overfitting of local data. Finally, in order to continuously correct the update direction of the local model and improve the accuracy of the global model, the shared knowledge model on the client is updated using the exponential moving average (EMA) method. In order to evaluate, we manually constructed the non-IID dataset in the real scene. Experiments show that compared with the existing methods, the global model accuracy of the SKH-FL algorithm proposed in this paper is improved by 5.07%.","2575-4955","979-8-3503-1792-3","10.1109/IC-NIDC59918.2023.10390660","National Key Research and Development Program of china(grant numbers:2022YFB25-03202); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10390660","Federated Learning;Non-IID Data;Knowledge Distillation","Training;Knowledge engineering;Degradation;Deep learning;Data privacy;Limiting;Federated learning","","","","8","IEEE","23 Jan 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Because the knowledge followers need to pay for the cost of information searching, self-learning for knowledge. Therefore, there should be an equilibrium price for knowledge leaders and followers to share knowledge. And then, a game model is constructed to interpret deeply the mechanism of dilemma.

We propose POME (Pattern-based Opinion MinEr), an approach that leverages natural language parsing and pattern-matching to classify Stack Overflow sentences referring to APIs according to seven aspects (e.g., performance, usability), and to determine their polarity (positive vs negative). The patterns have been inferred by manually analyzing 4,346 sentences from Stack Overflow linked to a total of 30 APIs. We evaluated POME by (i) comparing the pattern-matching approach with machine learners leveraging the patterns themselves as well as n-grams extracted from Stack Overflow posts; (ii) assessing the ability of POME to detect the polarity of sentences, as compared to sentiment-analysis tools; (iii) comparing POME with the state-of-the-art Stack Overflow opinion mining approach, Opiner, through a study involving 24 human evaluators.

Because knowledge is considered as a resource of organization competition and a kind of strategic capital, the more the knowledge is expanded in an organization, the more the capacity of competition is. Although there are many theoretical literatures that suggest management means or normative rules to prompt knowledge sharing in an organization, it is difficult to evaluate the effect of knowledge sharing in an organization. The behavior of knowledge sharing among individuals in an organization is involved in the characteristics of knowledge, a conflict of interests, and interaction among actors and the organization that actors reside in. Therefore, the phenomenon of knowledge sharing is the result of dynamics, complexity, nonlinear interaction among knowledge seekers and providers, and the organization that actors belong to. In this paper, agent-based modeling is proposed for exploring the effect of knowledge sharing in an organization. The decisionmaking whether an actor share their knowledge with other is simply drawn an analogy to the prisoners' dilemma game. According to the different actor's payoff due to the characteristics of knowledge, the situations of knowledge sharing in an organization is discussed. According to the result of experiences, we found that no matter what types of knowledge sharing payoff matrices were, agents finally shared their knowledge with others. Nevertheless, most agents would take the Tit-for-Tat strategy.","2166-5729","978-1-4244-0219-9","10.1109/ICOCI.2006.5276482","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5276482","","Knowledge management;Decision making;Game theory;Video sharing;Costs;Knowledge engineering;Reservoirs;Standards organizations;Management information systems;Paper technology","","1","","9","IEEE","2 Oct 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In such an era, the emergence of knowledge sharing communities provides great convenience for human beings to search, acquire, communicate and share knowledge, and question-and-answer-type knowledge sharing communities are derived from virtual communities. Through the literature research method, this study outlines the development of knowledge sharing from six theories: social exchange theory, social capital theory capital, social influence theory, social cognitive theory and the technology acceptance model. The question-and-answer community knowledge sharing model is constructed by integrating six knowledge sharing models, such as the SECI knowledge transformation model and WSR-KS. Based on the knowledge and social characteristics of the Q&A-based knowledge sharing community, the construction of the Q&A-based community knowledge sharing model contains 3 dimensions and 14 aspects. The community itself builds a standardized system of management, the important qualities that knowledge sharing users need to have, and the clear organization of knowledge content are the important things that promote the long-term development of knowledge sharing in Q&A-based communities. The purpose of model construction is to promote the knowledge sharing and service functions of question-and-answer type knowledge communities.","","978-1-83953-788-2","10.1049/icp.2022.1478","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9957022","","","","","","","","22 Nov 2022","","","IET","IET Conferences"

These components may include a broad range of entities such as services, libraries, and frameworks, all intended to address specific requirements. It is not only necessary that these components satisfy respective functional and non-functional concerns, but also that the combinations of selected components work well together. The space of component combinations to explore is huge. Together with the almost universal lack of formal documentation suggesting desirable combinations and cautioning against undesirable ones, this renders the proper selection of combinations very challenging. For this reason, software engineers often solicit advice and document their experience on online forums such as community Q&A sites. In this paper, we show that these Q&A sites contain valuable knowledge about inter-component relations. We develop an approach using information extraction techniques to automatically identify three different types of compatibility relations from unstructured text on Q&A site postings. Our work demonstrates that identifying such relations is valuable for the design of component-based systems and that automatic relation extraction is a promising technique to systematically harness such community knowledge.","","978-1-7281-2272-4","10.1109/RAISE.2019.00011","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8823731","Component Based Software Development;Relation Extraction;Information Extraction;Deep Learning","Feature extraction;Software;Task analysis;Software engineering;Documentation;Information retrieval;Security","","2","","22","IEEE","5 Sep 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Prior research identified numerous incentives that can motivate knowledge sharing in online communities such as self-efficacy and trust. However, research did not consider the effects of community types on the effectiveness of these incentives. In this paper we use meta-analysis to examine the effects of community type on knowledge sharing incentives in communities of interest and communities of practice. We examined 24 papers focusing on knowledge sharing incentives and we found that the type of online community moderates the effects of trust, commitment, task enjoyment and reciprocity on knowledge sharing.

Performing this classification is advantageous, as yes/no questions can generally be answered using the data that is already available. In the case of an opinion-based or a yes/no question that wasn't previously answered, an external knowledge source is needed to generate the answer. We propose a LSTM based model that performs question classification into the two aforementioned categories. Given a question as an input, the objective is to classify it into opinion-based or yes/no question. The proposed model was tested on the Amazon community question-answer dataset as it is reflective of the problem statement we are trying to solve. The proposed methodology achieved promising results, with a high accuracy rate of 91% in question classification.","","978-1-5386-5906-9","10.1109/ICCCNT45670.2019.8944861","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8944861","Classification;Supervised learning;Deep Learning;Soft Computing","Support vector machines;Feature extraction;Convolution;Recurrent neural networks;Biological system modeling;Information technology","","7","","22","IEEE","30 Dec 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, to date, there is no principled method to collect or analyze API usability information that incorporates input from typical developers. In practice, developers often turn to Q&A websites such as stackoverflow.com (SO) when seeking expert advice on API use, the popularity of such sites has thus led to a very large volume of unstructured information that can be searched with diligence for answers to specific questions. The collected wisdom within such sites could, in principle, be of great help to API designers to better support developer needs, if only it could be collected, analyzed, and distilled for practical use. In this paper, we present a methodology that combines several techniques, including social network analysis and topic mining, to recommend SO posts that are likely to concern API design-related issues. To establish a comparison baseline, we introduce two more recommendation approaches: a reputation-based recommender and a random recommender.

The questions and answers relations help Learning-to-Rank models for Community Question Answering (CQA) tasks to sort user comments to answer questions by relevance. These learning models automatically rank comments as potential answer candidates for new questions. However, finding the proper models for CQA models also depends on the information used to match question and answer pairs. This paper aims to summarise a study about Community Question-Answering (CQA) models in two specific domains: Personal Finance &Money (PF&M) and Home Improvements (HI). We built CQA datasets, where all the data are scraped from user posts in a web community. This dataset provides further explicit user information to build and train our CQA baselines, such as question descriptions and multiple questioner tags to expand the information in short user questions. We offer different evaluation scenarios to assess the baseline performance associated with distinct text inputs by considering two measures: MAP and MRR. CQA models propose answer candidates ranked list based on the QA pairs relevance. We also offer an automatic tag extractor to obtain tags from question descriptions to evaluate the importance of user tags for CQA model performance. In web forums like StackExchange, questioners use multiple tags as keywords to refer to the question context (e.g., investment, tax, health insurance and so on). Our experiments show that incorporating multiple tags and question descriptions to expand user question information improves the performance of CQA for different transformer-based baselines. Our results show that our tag extraction method, which condenses question descriptions into tags, delivered a compelling outcome when we compared the effectiveness of user- and machine-generated tags as model inputs in CQA baselines.","2472-9671","979-8-3503-8535-9","10.1109/ICSC59802.2024.00021","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10475631","Natural Language Processing;Learning to Rank;Neural Networks;Web Content;Question Answering","Knowledge engineering;Semantics;Natural languages;Finance;Insurance;Predictive models;Transformers","","","","28","IEEE","22 Mar 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The paper proposes that an individual's knowledge sharing behavior is driven by a set of salient beliefs that are not unlike the notion of payoff in game theory. Using the case of a telecommunication company in Egypt, the paper employed multi-person game theoretic structure to determine the game played by the employees.

Data were collected from 113 members of 13 virtual student teams consisting of participants from Asia and Europe. Contrary to the team-member exchange theory, the findings suggest that, in GVTs, exchange ideology negatively moderates the relationships between extrinsic rewards, reciprocity and knowledge sharing, and had no moderating effect on the relationship between image and knowledge sharing. These results provoke theoretical implications that some contextual factors of GVTs may influence the moderating effects of individual difference.

The system layer aggregates individual cognitions into group cognition and discover relations among the knowledge, users and the resources. The storage layer stores necessary information. Then this paper describes how the system supports cognition constructing, modeling and aggregating. There are four elements in SGCL system, which are learners, knowledge, resources and relations between two of the pervious elements. At last, this paper analyzes the network made of the four elements and explains how the system discovers knowledge group, resources group and learners group so as to help learners to construct their cognition maps.","","978-1-4244-4507-3","10.1109/CISE.2009.5363047","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5363047","","Collaborative work;Cognition;Computer architecture;Aggregates;Humans;Computer networks;Computer network management;Innovation management;Knowledge management;Technology management","","2","","9","IEEE","28 Dec 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

AGSD workers preferably convey architectural knowledge (AK) by frequent interactions across sites through unstructured and textual electronic media (UTEM) (chats, emails, forums, etc.), i.e., AK is articulated in these media. UTEM leave unstructured logs of shared AK. We present an empirical study to understand AK articulation through UTEM in AGSD teams. Our results are an ontological model about AK articulation through UTEM in AGSD teams, and 11 categories of UTEM interactions across sites, where requirements and coding themes were prominent.

Collaborative modeling is one way to capture this shared understanding. Increasingly, in large systems engineering projects different distances lead to social barriers between stakeholders. These barriers affect the quantity and quality of knowledge that is shared between stakeholders, thus reducing the quality of the resulting product. While it has been proposed to limit modeling activities to co-located teams, this might not always be possible or feasible. We argue that, despite the technological advances in collaborative modeling, effective collaboration can only be achieved if we understand how to account for social barriers. We propose to study, in depth, how these barriers affect modeling, and how their effects can be reduced. By understanding the effects of social barriers and accounting for them, we can maximize the benefits of collaborative modeling.","","978-1-7281-5125-0","10.1109/MODELS-C.2019.00065","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8904686","Distance;Knowledge Sharing;Collaborative Modeling;Social Factors;Psychological Factors;Human Factors","","","2","","16","IEEE","21 Nov 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Nowadays, law enforcement agencies in Malaysia such as The Royal Malaysian Police have extensively varying capabilities to conduct forensics, and sometimes have to enlisting the assist from other agencies or outside consultants to perform digital forensics investigation and analysis. Unfortunately, new forensics discoveries are seldom formally shared among the organization or agency even under the same roof. One main problem needs to be addressed is there is no effective way that allows digital forensics experts to share their expertise and collaborate among them. A web-based Knowledge Management System (KMS) for digital forensics is needed to encourage experts in digital forensics share and improve their knowledge. This paper presents a prototype web-based application using the concept of Web 2.0 technologies integrated with the suitable features of KM System.

In this study we report on the content evaluation of an OKR developed for South African ICT4D researchers. The aim is to investigate what the user's content requirements are when using an ICT4D OKR. We used a mixed-methods approach, whereby we conducted pre-test interviews on users' expectation. We then presented them with an OKR which was developed according to user requirements from literature. Usability testing with eye tracking was used to evaluate the OKR, the evaluation also included a post-test questionnaire and interviews. The approach allows triangulation between the data from the interviews and the usability testing. The contribution lies in the updated content requirements and the use of a mixed-methods approach in validating OKR requirements.","","978-1-5386-1001-5","10.1109/ICTAS.2018.8368748","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8368748","ICT4D;knowledge sharing platforms;collaboration","Task analysis;Usability;Interviews;Testing;Gaze tracking;Communications technology;Collaboration","","2","","16","IEEE","31 May 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We present here a method for case-based reasoners to share knowledge without the need for a prior interlingua. Using the similarity metrics and the cases known to each agent, we demonstrate how classes in one knowledge base can be mapped into classes of another knowledge base with the help of a critic function. In the case that the critic function is mechanically realizable (e.g. a high fidelity simulation of the domain of interest), our method becomes well-suited for highly-autonomous case-based reasoners.","","0-7803-9093-8","10.1109/IRI-05.2005.1506515","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1506515","","Artificial intelligence;Logic;Mediation","","","","14","IEEE","12 Sep 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This will be time saving as the users can split the work between them. Summarization is the process of condensing a document into a shorter version which will contain the important details about the document. This will be useful to quickly get the main ideas without having to go through the entire document. Our main aim is to combine collaborative search with document summarization so that it will be helpful when users in a group want to quickly read the summary of the documents whenever required. In the collaborative search, the results will be re-ranked based on the user's interaction with the system, so that feedback driven ranking of results is attained and the users in a session will be able to view pages that were even ranked by their co-mates. This re-raking process is done by obtaining the user's interest on a particular page using decision logic and updating it in the priority queue. User's meta-data like page size, click-through rate, time spent and scrolling speed of the document will be calculated and these will be used as parameters for the decision logic to find the interest level of the user. Extractive summarization is implemented with the concept of Maximum Independent Set. The raw text document is first converted into a graph having its sentences as nodes and the edge weight is the similar instances between sentences. Then graph MIS is identified and removed after which the top-n sentences are fetched upon its eigenvector centrality value and the summary is generated.","","979-8-3315-4036-4","10.1109/ICSES63445.2024.10763244","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10763244","Collaborative Search Engine;Document Summarization;Extractive Summarization;Eigenvector;Priority Queue","Collaboration;Search engines;Logic;Expert systems","","","","26","IEEE","3 Dec 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Most of the existing work treats code snippets as text fragments, ignoring the effect of the structured information (i.e. sequential information) of the code. Meanwhile, much of the existing work does not take into account the interactive between code snippets and queries. In this paper, we propose a novel deep neural network named HECS1 (Hierarchical embedding for code search) to solve the problems mentioned above. Our method divides the embedding process of code and query into two hierarchies, that is, the potential information is captured by two modules (the Intra-language encoding module and the Cross-language encoding module). In particular, our approach uses special LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) variants, which is ON-LSTM (ordered neurons LSTM) to capture the keyword order structure of the code. The Intra-language encoding module is implemented by the LSTM variant and the Cross-language encoding module is an interactive information calculation module implemented by the attention mechanism. In this way, the similarity between the query and the corresponding code snippets in the vector space could be better captured. HECS can understand the difference between positive and negative samples more accurately. We empirically evaluate HECS, using a large scale codebase collected from StackOverflow. The experimental results show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance.","2161-4407","978-1-7281-6926-2","10.1109/IJCNN48605.2020.9207101","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9207101","code search;hierarchical embedding;structured sequence information","Encoding;Software;Logic gates;Search problems;Biological neural networks","","4","","35","IEEE","28 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, code snippets in answers on Q&A sites like Stack Overflow (SO) often lack comments because answerers volunteer their time and often skip comments or explanations due to time constraints. Existing studies show that these online code examples are difficult to read and understand, making it difficult for developers (espe-cially novices) to use them correctly and leading to misuse. Given these challenges, we introduced AUTOGENICS, a tool designed to integrate with SO to generate effective inline comments for code snippets in SO answers exploiting large language models (LLMs). Our contributions are threefold. First, we randomly select 400 answer code snippets (200 Python + 200 Java) from SO and gener-ate inline comments for them using LLMs (e.g., Gemini). We then manually evaluate these comments' effectiveness using four key metrics: accuracy, adequacy, conciseness, and usefulness. Overall, LLMs demonstrate promising effectiveness in generating inline comments for SO answer code snippets. Second, we surveyed 14 active SO users to perceive the effectiveness of these inline comments. The survey results are consistent with our previous manual evaluation. However, according to our evaluation, LLMs-generated comments are less effective for shorter code snippets and sometimes produce noisy comments. Third, to address the gaps, we introduced AUTOGENICS that extracts additional context from question texts and generates context-aware inline comments. It also optimizes comments by removing noise (e.g., comments in import statements and variable declarations). We evaluate the effectiveness of AUTOGENICS-generated comments using the same four metrics that outperform those of standard LLMs. AUTOGENICS might (a) enhance code comprehension with context-aware inline comments, (b) save time, and improve developers' ability to learn and reuse code more accurately.","2470-6892","979-8-3315-2850-8","10.1109/SCAM63643.2024.00013","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10795275","Stack overflow;Inline comments;Large Lan-guage Models;Tool Support;User Study","Surveys;Java;Codes;Source coding;Noise;Programming;Noise measurement;Usability;Standards;Python","","","","70","IEEE","19 Dec 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It is widely accepted that badges “steer” people's behavior toward increasing their rate of contributions before obtaining the badge. This paper provides a new probabilistic model of user behavior in the presence of badges. By applying the model to data from thousands of users on the Q&A site Stack Overflow, we find that steering is not as widely applicable as was previously understood. Rather, the majority of users remain apathetic toward badges, while still providing a substantial number of contributions to the site. An interesting statistical phenomenon, termed “Phantom Steering,” accounts for the interaction data of these users and this may have contributed to some previous conclusions about steering. Our results suggest that a small population, approximately 20%, of users respond to the badge incentives. Moreover, we conduct a qualitative survey of the users on Stack Overflow which provides further evidence that the insights from the model reflect the true behavior of the community. We argue that while badges might contribute toward a suite of effective rewards in an online system, research into other aspects of reward systems, such as Stack Overflow's reputation points, should become a focus of the community.","2374-8486","978-1-7281-8316-9","10.1109/ICDM50108.2020.00026","National Science Foundation(grant numbers:CCF-2007080,IIS-2024287,CCF-1733556); Office of Naval Research(grant numbers:N00014-20-1-2488); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9338378","Virtual badges;steering;goal-gradient hypothesis;amortized inference","Conferences;Sociology;Phantoms;Probabilistic logic;Data models;Data mining;Statistics","","","","21","IEEE","9 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Then by means of multiple regression analysis, factor scores have been estimated by using the feature values of statements e.g., syntactic information, etc. The factor scores estimated and obtained have been subsequently employed for inspecting their potential to detect respondents who are likely to post appropriate answers to a posted question. However, our method has considerably depended on the syntactic information extracted through morphological analysis. Furthermore, this method has a critical downside of numerous explanatory variables and complicated multiple regression equation to estimate factor scores. Thus, we have shifted our principle to use N-gram on top of morphological analysis. In this paper, 4-gram is applied to the feature values, in a similar way as the previous analysis using 2-gram and 3-gram. Further analysis has shown that 4-gram is also applicable to our method. As a result of the analysis, 2-gram, 3-gram and 4-gram also outscore morphological analysis in terms of estimation accuracy; above all 2-gram shows the best accuracy. By and large, it could be suggested that N-gram as well as morphological analysis should be more sufficient than mere morphological analysis as the syntactic information of the feature values to estimate factor scores.","","979-8-3503-0992-8","10.1109/IIAI-AAI-Winter58034.2022.00016","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10123522","Q&A Site;Factor Score;Multiple Regression Analysis;N-gram","Estimation;Syntactics;Feature extraction;Regression analysis;Data mining;Informatics","","4","","11","IEEE","18 May 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Indian-users are observed to discuss solutions of their local water-related problems while no water-related discussion is observed from desalination-pioneers like Saudi-Arabia, Israel etc. Finite annual freshwater inventories are inadequate to meet stringently burgeoning human demand for water. To fathom desalination as a solution to water-scarcity by employing renewable energy, we draw a comparison of India and Saudi-Arabia and suggest desalination of sea-water as the sustainable solution for water-scarcity in regions with proximity to seas and oceans.

This is because most of the universities postponed the physical attendance at universities and used technology tools to keep the communication among the academic staff and students. ICT allows for the rapid search, access, and retrieval of information and collaboration between employees, while ICT infrastructure refers to the equipment, software, communication systems, and the human component such as experience, skills, command, principles. The purpose of this study was to investigate the impact of ICT and ICT infrastructure on Knowledge Sharing among academic staff. The study was conducted at nine Iraqi public universities located in Baghdad and the sample was the academic staff at these universities. The study employed the stratified sample method to ensure equal distribution among the nine universities, and the data was collected using the questionnaire. Structural equation modelling was utilized to analyze 267 valid questionnaires. After testing the measurement model and ensuring the model fit, the study examined the structural model to find the results. The result showed that ICT and ICT infrastructure had positive and significant impact on Knowledge Sharing among the academic staff at Iraqi public universities. However, the result indicated the Knowledge Sharing was highly impacted by ICT infrastructure. The government and universities should enhance and improve the ICT infrastructure that would provide a great benefit to the Iraqi universities' reputation as well as the universities' rank.","","978-1-7281-9169-0","10.1109/AiCIS51645.2020.00032","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9408261","Knowledge Sharing;ICT;infrastructure;university;COVID-19","COVID-19;Pandemics;Communication systems;Government;Collaboration;Tools;Software","","13","","51","IEEE","26 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Although blockchain technology shows defensibility in dealing with trust issues, it is difficult to be applied in large-scale vehicular networks due to the computation consumption of mining process and frequent synchronization of ledger. In this paper, we propose a directed acyclic graph (DAG) enabled knowledge-sharing framework in which vehicular knowledge is encapsulated as a site in the DAG. A new tip selection algorithm (TSA) and a fast authentication scheme for cross-regional vehicles are designed to reduce computation and storage expenditure. Simulation results show that the proposed DAG framework can achieve a higher knowledge sharing quality and lower authentication latency compared with traditional DAG systems.","1938-1883","978-1-7281-7122-7","10.1109/ICC42927.2021.9500503","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9500503","DAG Blockchain;Internet of Vehicles;Knowledge Sharing","Simulation;Scalability;Authentication;Transportation;Stability analysis;Blockchains;Sensors","","6","","11","IEEE","6 Aug 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the corporation still faces many difficulties to share knowledge because of many social factors such as corporate social responsibility. In this paper, a cause-effect model is established to analyze the relationship between corporation social responsibility and efficiency of knowledge sharing by middle variables (i.e. corporate leadership and reputation). And then, Based on social network, a threshold model is constructed to explore how the corporate social responsibility affects the efficiency of knowledge sharing. The simulation results confirm that the corporate social responsibility will indirectly affect the knowledge sharing efficiency through corporate leadership and reputation. There is a significant positive correlation between them. This provides a new perspective to study the non-technical factors which lead to dilemma of knowledge sharing.

In Chinese society, the concept of “guanxi” is far more complicated than Western “relationship”. In this study, we adopt both Eastern and Western perspectives to explore the link between interpersonal relationships, guanxi, and knowledge sharing. To address this oversight, 60 sets of completed questionnaires from 260 research and development (R&D) employees from Taiwan formed the basis of our empirical analysis. We found that members with higher level expressive ties tend to offer a higher level of knowledge sharing, but that members with higher level of instrumental ties tend to offer lower levels of knowledge sharing.

However, individuals do not always share their knowledge, and they may be reluctant to share too much information as the organization wants. The graduate team in colleges and universities is a team of knowledge-based talents with research goals and complementary research skills. Knowledge sharing is the foundation of postgraduate research and research projects in academic research. Knowledge is the core resource of postgraduate teams in higher education institutions. Only when knowledge resources are shared, can more postgraduate students use and be innovated, and resources can be realized in scientific research projects and finally optimize the effect of the configuration.

As a result of analysis, the proposed method successfully selected potential respondents that were more than approximately average when it came to appropriately answering a given question. Nevertheless, this methodology was greatly dependent on the syntactic information extracted through morphological analysis. Therefore, N-gram has been applied to the methodology as an alternative method of morphological analysis. In applying N-gram, the estimation of factor scores and detecting of the respondent who can appropriately answer a question have been realized so far. Thus, in this paper, finding respondents who can properly answer a newly posted question based on 2-gram is investigated.

As a result, these websites have become valuable knowledge repositories, covering a wealth of topics related to particular programming languages. This knowledge is even more useful as the developer community evaluates both questions and answers through a voting mechanism. As votes accumulate, the developer community recognizes reputed members and further trusts their answers. In this paper, we analyze the community's questions and answers to determine the developers' personality traits, using the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC). We explore the personality traits of Stack Overflow authors by categorizing them into different categories based on their reputation. Through textual analysis of Stack Overflow posts, we found that the top reputed authors are more extroverted compared to medium and low reputed users. Moreover, authors of up-voted posts express significantly less negative emotions than authors of down-voted posts.","1063-6773","978-0-7695-4981-1","10.1109/ICSM.2013.72","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6676932","","Java;Androids;Humanoid robots;Analysis of variance;Communities;Pragmatics;Dictionaries","","71","","10","IEEE","2 Dec 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Therefore, it is of great significance to design some effective strategies of recommending experts for new questions. In this paper, we propose a novel personalized recommendation method for routing new questions to a group of experts. Different from prior work which only considers the topic modeling or the link structure, we aim at recommending new questions to more appropriate experts by considering both of these two factors. Moreover, we design a new strategy of network construction with the personalization fully considered.

Previous studies indicated that different knowledge sharing strategies increase the performance of the dynamic vector evaluated particle swarm optimisation (DVEPSO) algorithm in different dynamic environments. Therefore, this paper investigates the performance of the DVEPSO algorithm using heterogeneous particle swarm optimisation (HPSO) algorithms, where each particle uses a different knowledge sharing strategy. The goal of this study is to determine whether the use of HPSOs will improve the performance of DVEPSO by incorporating particles with different knowledge sharing strategies in a single DVEPSO algorithm. The results indicate that using HPSOs improves the performance of DVEPSO for dynamic multi-objective optimisation problems with a complex Pareto-optimal set and that the performance of heterogeneous DVEPSO compares favourably with that of DVEPSO.","","978-1-4799-4458-3","10.1109/SIS.2014.7011804","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7011804","","Heuristic algorithms;Optimization;Vectors;Loss measurement;Optical fibers;Particle swarm optimization;Benchmark testing","","1","","32","IEEE","19 Jan 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Results show that a meaningful work is related with knowledge sharing, but is mediated by organizational identification. Furthermore, we found that the way to obtain knowledge donating is preceded by knowledge collecting. These associations provide insight into engineers' attitudes towards sharing knowledge as a way to differentiate profiles in the organizational environments and promote further research in this regard. Practical implications revolve around the justification for working on practices that not only foster meaningfulness in the workplace, but also organizational identification in order to obtain adequate levels of organizational knowledge sharing.

Managing change effectively and reducing the negative effects of day-today operations has become one of the most important tasks in IT service management, which require hiring highly skilled IT professionals with correspondingly high labor costs. There is a challenge to select, implement and integrate the right resources quickly and effectively. Although there is a growing body of research into IT management, many techniques are either too narrow (focusing on a single component rather than the entire system), or they address only configuration data collection and integration. Instead, one needs to scale or respond to special domain knowledge, collaboration and the right data for helping IT professionals to improve their work. In this paper, we propose a knowledge-sharing based collaborating management system for IT service management. It aims to bridge the gap between domain experts' knowledge and manageable systems. We developed a proof-of-concept of an impact analysis service based on knowledge-sharing; it establishes an IT service management collaboration paradigm and ecosystem, leveraging the expert's rich knowledge and experience to improve the management quality and reduce the cost. A case study driven by customers demonstrates that collaboration with knowledge sharing is effective both at constructing useful system analysis services and in using those services to improve system management.","","978-0-7695-3709-2","10.1109/ICWS.2009.93","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5175838","ITSM;knowledge sharing;business intelligence;collaboration","Collaboration;Knowledge management;Collaborative work;Quality management;Environmental management;Collaborative software;Costs;Bridges;Application software;Management training","","1","","13","IEEE","31 Jul 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The higher the power distance perceived by employees, the weaker the positive relationship between the leadership-member exchange and the workplace friendship. Finally, theoretical and practical implications were put forwarded stemming from this study and the suggest directions for future researches were also provided.","","978-1-5386-6968-6","10.1109/IEIS.2018.8597963","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8597963","leadership-member exchange;knowledge sharing;workplace friendship;power distance","Employment;Mathematical model;Organizations;Economics;Rail transportation;Knowledge management;Psychology","","","","15","IEEE","3 Jan 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we propose a novel de-anonymization framework called MPT, effectively improving the model’s ability to capture long-range dependencies between nodes by integrating graph neural networks(GNNs) and language models(LMs). Specifically, we use GNN to extract structural features, and then we encode and fuse node representations from multiple meta-paths using Transformer and attention mechanisms. Extensive experiments on Zhihu and Quora data sets show that our model significantly outperforms the baseline model. In addition, our model possesses a degree of interpretability, enabling a comprehensive comprehension of the underlying factors contributing to user privacy breaches and facilitating the implementation of appropriate safeguards.

These manipulate deceptive contents, aggregating into multiple collusive questions and answers (Q&As) spam groups, can fully control the sentiment of a target and distort the decision of users, which pollute the CQA environment and make it less credible. In this paper, we propose a Pattern and Burstiness based Collusive Q&A Spam Detection method (PBCSD) to identify the deceptive questions and answers. Specifically, we intensively study the campaign process of crowdsourcing tasks and summarize the clues in the Q&As’ vocabulary usage level when collusive attacks are launched. Based on the clues, we extract the Q&A groups using frequent pattern mining and further purify them by the burstiness on posting time of Q&As. By designing several discriminative features at the Q&A group level, multiple machine learning based classifiers can be used to judge the groups as deceptive or ordinary, and the Q&As in deceptive groups are finally identified as collusive Q&A spam. We evaluate the proposed PBCSD method in a real-world dataset collected from Baidu Zhidao, a famous CQA platform in China, and the experimental results demonstrate the PBCSD is effective for collusive Q&A spam detection and outperforms a number of state-of-art methods.","","978-1-6654-0745-8","10.1109/CBD54617.2021.00024","National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9816327","Community Question Answering;Collusive Spamming Activities;Q&A Spam Detection;Frequent Pattern;Burstiness Detecting","Crowdsourcing;Knowledge engineering;Vocabulary;Unsolicited e-mail;Web and internet services;Machine learning;Big Data","","","","22","IEEE","11 Jul 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this research, we explore the factors which motivate people to participate actively in social collaboration. We conceptualized that use of social collaboration is an intentional social action where people willing to share their knowledge, experience and expertise. We examine the relative impact of We-Intention, moral trust and self-motivation to participate in social collaboration and knowledge sharing activity. An empirical study of social collaborators has been done and we concluded that knowledge sharing is an important goal to participate in social collaboration.","1530-1605","978-1-4799-7367-5","10.1109/HICSS.2015.40","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7069688","Social Collaboration;We-intention;Moral Trust;Self-Motivation","Collaboration;Ethics;Social network services;Knowledge engineering;Organizations;Communities;Acceleration","","5","","59","IEEE","30 Mar 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This new Master/Slave MPI based solver leverages the additional computational power that can be exploited from modern computer and system architectures, to solve more relevant instances and faster than previous generation solvers. Knowledge sharing plays a critical role in the performance of PaQuBE. However, due to the overhead associated with sending and receiving MPI messages, and the restricted communication/network bandwidth available between solvers, it is essential that we optimize not only which information is shared, but how it is shared. In this context, we compare multiple conflict clause and solution cube sharing strategies, and finally show that an adaptive method works best. Additionally, compression of solution cubes was explored which reduced the system time associated with message passing while also reducing network traffic.","","978-1-4244-4906-4","10.1109/HPCSIM.2009.5195312","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5195312","QBF;Knowledge Sharing;Parallel","Power generation;Master-slave;Computer architecture;Bandwidth;Context;Message passing;Telecommunication traffic;Testing;Circuits;Power system modeling","","5","","22","IEEE","7 Aug 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The model draws on activity and situation awareness theories, as well as the belief theory in AI. A primary focus of the model is to enable clinicians in disparate locations to gain a common representation of relevant situational information in each other's work contexts based on the notion of clinical work practice.

Considering that participants of the same virtual community may experience a context effect resulting from perceived organizational consensus, this study employs a hierarchical linear model (HLM) for verification. This study proposes the following hypothesis: transformational leadership affects value co-creation by community members through social capital at the organizational level and knowledge sharing at the individual level. The results show that at the organizational level, transformational leadership positively affects social capital, which in turn positively affects value co-creation at the individual level. In addition, organizational-level transformational leadership positively influences knowledge sharing at the individual level, which in turn positively affects individual-level value co-creation. This study offers four contributions to the field of research: (a) contrary to previous studies that have emphasized commercial virtual communities, this study applies value co-creation to non-commercial virtual communities, investigating these communities to determine the source of innovation value, thereby advancing the exploration of value co-creation; (b) adopting the perspective of community leaders, this study compensates for the deficiencies of previous studies that adopted the perspective of customers; (c) concerning the overall framework, this study establishes organizational- and individual-level driving factors, investigating how transformational leadership influences value co-creation by community members; and (d) regarding methodology contribution, because virtual community composition exhibits nested characteristics, this study adopts the HLM for verification, increasing the accuracy of cross-level explanatory power that high-level explanatory variables possess for low-level dependent variables.","","978-1-4799-3776-9","10.1109/CSCWD.2014.6846864","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6846864","value co-creation;transformational leadership;social capital;knowledge sharing;hierarchical linear model (HLM)","Communities;Lead;Educational institutions;Technological innovation;Organizations;Correlation","","2","","54","IEEE","8 Jul 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, most research studies have focused on safeguarding information systems assets such as networks and databases, but little attention has been given to integrating security measures into KS practices, especially in developing countries. This study proposes a model incorporating security into KS behavior through Knowledge Risk Governance (KRG) that moderates the process. The potential components of the Knowledge Sharing Risk Governance (KSRG) model were identified through a comprehensive literature review. Social Exchange Theory (SET) was chosen as the theoretical framework to elucidate KS behavior and outline the formative elements of KRG. The Ministry of Agriculture was selected as a representative public organization, and a case study approach was used to collect data through questionnaires. The results showed that (1) SET factors have a positive correlation with KS behavior, (2) KRG moderates the relationship between these SET factors and KS behavior, and (3) KS, facilitated by KRG as a moderating factor, effectively mitigates KS-related risks. In summary, this study highlights the significant role of KSRG in ensuring KS security and reducing associated risks. The findings underscore the importance of integrating security measures into KS practices. They offer valuable insights for senior managers to evaluate and improve their organization's current KS strategies and security requirements.","","979-8-3503-6969-4","10.1109/ICECCE61019.2023.10442180","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10442180","Knowledge Sharing;Knowledge Sharing Security;Knowledge Sharing Risks;Knowledge Risk Governance","Knowledge engineering;Organizations;Developing countries;Agriculture;Behavioral sciences;Security;Information systems","","","","55","EU","27 Feb 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we first propose a hierarchical cloud-edge orchestrated federated learning architecture for IoT, named HCE-FL, which aims to provide intelligent and distributed data analysis for IoT users. To address the FL privacy issues, we then design a multi-level access control encryption-based IoT knowledge sharing approach for HCE-FL. In our approach, IoT users could be classified into different levels according to their individual privacy requirements. In addition, the proposed multi-level access control encryption algorithm could ensure the confidentiality of the IoT knowledge flow, which runs through local clients, edge sanitizers, and cloud servers in HCE-FL. Moreover, security theoretical analysis shows that our HCE-FL could satisfy“no read” and no write” security rules for the mandatory IoT knowledge access control. Finally, we conduct experiments based on classic MNIST and CIFARIO datasets to evaluate our HCE-FL. The experimental results demonstrate that our solution can achieve personalized privacy-preserving FL without losing IoT data availability and users can obtain better model accuracy and convergence rate through secure IoT knowledge access and sharing.","2994-3523","979-8-3503-5826-1","10.1109/MSN60784.2023.00124","National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10566968","federated learning;privacy protection;knowledge sharing;Internet of Things","Access control;Training;Privacy;Cloud computing;Data analysis;Federated learning;Smart cities","","","","17","IEEE","26 Jun 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, a new method to find experts in CQA is proposed by considering user post contents, answer votes, ratio of best answers, and user relation. The votes are used in post relation analysis to calculate user authority. The user's knowledge score can be calculated through topic analysis. Considering that a question usually includes many trivial words, an accurate distribution is nearly impossible to obtain with LDA. To solve this problem, vocabulary is extended by including the link information shown in a question, the top 10 relevant words from Wikipedia are provided for each tag. Tag-LDA models the user topic distribution and predicts the topic distribution of new questions. An experiment is conducted on Stack Overflow dataset, which is the world's largest computer programming CQA site.

In this paper, we formalize expert finding as a learning to rank task by leveraging the user feedback on answers (i.e., the votes of answers) as the ""relevance"" labels. To achieve this task, we present a listwise learning to rank approach, which is referred to as ListEF. In the ListEF approach, realizing that questions in CQA are relatively short and usually attached with tags, we propose a tagword topic model (TTM) to derive high-quality topical representations of questions. Based on TTM, we develop a COmpetition-based User exPertise Extraction (COUPE) method to capture user expertise features for given questions. We adopt the widely used listwise learning to rank method LambdaMART to train the ranking function. Finally, for a given question, we rank candidate users in descending order of the scores calculated by the trained ranking function, and select the users with high rankings as candidate experts. Experimental results on Stack Overflow show both our TTM and ListEF approach are effective with significant improvements over state-of-art methods.","2375-9259","978-1-4673-8493-3","10.1109/ICDMW.2015.181","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7395685","","Feature extraction;Training;Knowledge discovery;Resource management;Aggregates;Training data;Conferences","","7","","24","IEEE","4 Feb 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Maintaining high-quality content is necessary for relevant question retrieval, question recommendation, and enhancing the user experience. Manually removing low-quality content from the platform is time-consuming and challenging for site moderators. Thus, it is imperative to assess the content quality by automatically detecting and ‘closing’ the low-quality questions. Previous works have explored lexical, community-based, vote-based, and style-based features to detect low-quality questions. These approaches are limited to writing styles, textual, and handcrafted features. However, these features fall short in understanding semantic features and capturing the implicit relationships between tags and questions. In contrast, we propose LQuaD (Low-Quality Question Detection), a multi-tier hybrid framework that, a) incorporates semantic information of questions associated with each post using transformers, b) includes the question and tag information that enables learning via a graph convolutional network. LQuaD outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by a 21% higher F1-score on the dataset of 2.8 million questions. Furthermore, we apply survival analysis which acts as a proactive intervention to reduce the number of questions closed by informing users to take appropriate action. We find that the timeframe between the stages from the question's creation till it gets ‘closed’ varies significantly for tags and different ‘closing’ reasons for these questions.","2161-4407","978-1-7281-8671-9","10.1109/IJCNN55064.2022.9892454","SERB; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9892454","Stack Overflow;Community Question Answering;Low-quality questions","Semantics;Neural networks;Writing;Transformers;Feature extraction;Question answering (information retrieval);User experience","","2","","43","IEEE","30 Sep 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This necessitates ways to automatically assess the quality of new questions so as to maintain quality of content served to its users. While existing methods commonly employ social network indicators as features, our model aims to avoid social influence biases arising from these indicators by predicting the quality from semantic evaluation of the question text. Formulation of the proposed model is non-trivial as it requires the extraction of meaningful features from the noisy question text at different granularities while filtering redundant information. In this work, a neural architecture is proposed to address this problem by aggregating the textual features extracted at word- and sentence-level in a hierarchical manner. In addition, a unique attention mechanism that focuses on sentence segments for interpreting a question is developed. This new mechanism employs the global topical information from common problem contexts.

In this paper, we mine data from millions of questions from the Q&A site Stack Overflow, and using a discriminative model approach, we automatically suggest question tags to help a questioner choose appropriate tags for eliciting a response.","2160-1860","978-1-4673-2936-1","10.1109/MSR.2013.6624009","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6624009","Machine learning;automatic tagging;discriminative model","Tagging;Training;Accuracy;Support vector machines;Predictive models;Vectors;Prediction algorithms","","27","","4","IEEE","10 Oct 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Analyzing the dynamics of such communities is key to understanding network processes such as the flow of users and information in the network. In this paper, we study how users relate to topic-based communities and how such relationship shapes long-term community dynamics. Using a large dataset collected from Stack Overflow, a popular programming oriented Q&A site, we investigate several factors related to the evolution of communities in the site, such as user participation and the importance of revisits for community sustainability.

StackOverflow allows developers to ask and answer questions about code. Previous approach to search code on StackOverflow uses tf-idf method that based on number of occurrences of words to recommend source code. This method has the disadvantage that variable or method identifiers are considered as normal words, even though identifiers are often a combination of two or more words. For example, there is an identifier named “randomString”. In that case, if we search using a keyword “random” the system probably will not recommend “randomString” because both words are different. Concept location can tackle this problem. Concept location has been used widely to obtain the correlation between code with a specific concepts or features. Previous research of concept location only focused on source code's comments, and relation among the objects within the source code. This research proposes a mechanism for finding code on StackOverflow uses Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) using concept location in the preprocessing stage. Questions, answers, and code snippets about Java programming are downloaded from StackOverflow to a local repository. Corpuses are generated by extracting questions, answers and code snippets. Inferencing concept location from source code is created using LDA algorithm. Developers query concepts and then system will recommend source code based on the relevant concepts. The result of the experiment shows that the system is able to recommend source code with 48% average of precision and 58% average of recall.","","978-1-4799-7752-9","10.1109/ICoICT.2015.7231439","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7231439","Source Code Searching;Concept Location;Latent Dirichlet Allocation","Java;Conferences;Resource management;Software;Data preprocessing;Programming","","9","","20","IEEE","3 Sep 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we present our work on the construction of a taxonomy of crowdsourcing initiatives, which was built after reviewing a total of 60 exemplary crowdsourcing initiatives. The taxonomy, which consists of six components; user, process, content, platform, task and reward, can be used as a benchmark to better understand the current state of crowdsourcing initiatives with regards to the components that constitute the initiatives as it allows systematic comparison of existing crowdsourcing initiatives to be made.

Answers1, answerbag2, zhidao3, etc. Question retrieval (QR) in CQA can automatically find the most relevant and recent questions that have been solved by other users. Current QR approaches typically consider using diverse retrieval models, but they fail to analyze users' intention. User intentions such as finding facts, interacting with others, seeking reasons, etc. reflect what the users really want to know. Hence, we propose to integrate user intention analysis into QR. Firstly, we classify questions into different and multiple types of users' intentions. Another practical problem is that there naturally exist some preferences among the possible questions types. The more relevant type should be ranked higher than types which are not so relevant. Therefore, we propose to utilize a novel label ranking method, which is a machine learning algorithm that aims to predict a ranking among all the possible labels, to perform question classification. Secondly, based on the result of question classification, we integrate user intentions with translation-based language models to explore whether a user's intention does help to improve the performance. We conduct a series of experiments with Yahoo data, and the experimental results demonstrate that our proposed improved question retrieval can indeed enhance the performance of traditional question retrieval model.","2161-4407","978-1-4244-9637-2","10.1109/IJCNN.2011.6033242","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6033242","","Machine learning algorithms;Data models;Training data;Training;Support vector machines;History;Prediction algorithms","","6","","21","IEEE","3 Oct 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Three popularity-related features of questions are defined to build the popularity model: (a) potential hits, which reflect how many users are attracted by a question at their first glance; (b) popular terms, from which users find a question attractive; and (c) tedious unpopular terms. The notable characteristic of the proposed framework is extensibility and more features can be incorporated.

This paper introduces an innovative system for expert recommendation in disaster recovery during crisis events, implementing robust data validation mechanisms, fostering transparency, promoting data literacy, and harnessing AI-driven detection.A central focus of this paper is the integration of Community Question Answering (CQA) for Disaster Response within the IoT ecosystem, considering the computational aspects of IoT devices at the fog computing level. CQA leverages collective intelligence, enabling individuals and communities to post questions, share insights, and access real-time, context-aware information during disasters.The aim of this paper is to find an expert user capable of satisfactorily answering a question posed by other users. In the case of disaster recovery, the expert user is present in the coverage area of the functioning edge node through which askers forward their requests. Furthermore, the establishment of redundant communication channels bolsters IoT resilience, ensuring uninterrupted data flow even in adverse conditions. These comprehensive measures contribute to the development of a dependable IoT ecosystem, aiding in disaster recovery.","2375-9259","979-8-3503-8164-1","10.1109/ICDMW60847.2023.00116","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10411653","Disaster Recovery;Backup;Community Question Answering;Blockchain;Restore","Training;Disasters;Question answering (information retrieval);Real-time systems;Information management;Internet of Things;Edge computing","","2","","21","IEEE","6 Feb 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"Evaluating the quality of educational answers in community question-answering","L. T. Le; C. Shah; E. Choi","Department of Computer Science, Rutgers University; School of Communication and Information, Rutgers University; Brainly",2016 IEEE/ACM Joint Conference on Digital Libraries (JCDL),"5 Sep 2016","2016","","","129","138","Community Question-Answering (CQA), where questions and answers are generated by peers, has become a popular method of information seeking in online environments. While the content repositories created through CQA sites have been used widely to support general purpose tasks, using them as online digital libraries that support educational needs is an emerging practice. Horizontal CQA services, such as Yahoo! Answers, and vertical CQA services, such as Brainly, are aiming to help students improve their learning process by answering their educational questions. In these services, receiving high quality answer(s) to a question is a critical factor not only for user satisfaction, but also for supporting learning. However, the questions are not necessarily answered by experts, and the askers may not have enough knowledge and skill to evaluate the quality of the answers they receive. This could be problematic when students build their own knowledge base by applying inaccurate information or knowledge acquired from online sources. Using moderators could alleviate this problem. However, a moderator's evaluation of answer quality may be inconsistent because it is based on their subjective assessments. Employing human assessors may also be insufficient due to the large amount of content available on a CQA site. To address these issues, we propose a framework for automatically assessing the quality of answers. This is achieved by integrating different groups of features - personal, community-based, textual, and contextual - to build a classification model and determine what constitutes answer quality. To test this evaluation framework, we collected more than 10 million educational answers posted by more than 3 million users on Brainly's United States and Poland sites. The experiments conducted on these datasets show that the model using Random Forest (RF) achieves more than 83% accuracy in identifying high quality of answers. In addition, the findings indicate that personal and community-based features have more prediction power in assessing answer quality. Our approach also achieves high values on other key metrics such as F1-score and Area under ROC curve. The work reported here can be useful in many other contexts where providing automatic quality assessment in a digital repository of textual information is paramount.","","978-1-4503-4229-2","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7559575","Community Question-Answering (CQA);Answer Quality;Features","Context;Internet;Feature extraction;Quality assessment;Education;Libraries;Brain modeling","","1","","36","","5 Sep 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

First, in database refinement part, we construct an optimized and structured database by the best answer choosing method leveraging user attribute provided by the response provider. Second, in human-computer part, the UB-CQA is able to search and provide a more satisfying answer to users by similarity calculation and re-ranking method leveraging text categorization information.

In this paper, we present a question routing scheme which takes into account the answering, commenting and voting propensities of the users. Unlike prior work which focuses on routing a question to the most desirable expert, we focus on routing it to a group of users - who would be willing to collaborate and provide useful answers to that question. Through empirical evidence, we show that more answers and comments are desirable for improving the lasting value of a question-answer thread. As a result, our focus is on routing a question to a team of compatible users.We propose a recommendation model that takes into account the compatibility, topical expertise and availability of the users.

Meanwhile, existing approaches are less concerned with two problems: (1) How to deal with multiple types of seed entities simultaneously? (2) How to leverage the power of pre-trained language models (PLMs)? Being aware of these two problems, in this paper, we study the entity set co-expansion task in StackOverflow, which extracts Library, OS, Application, and Language entities from StackOverflow question-answer threads. During the co-expansion process, we use PLMs to derive embeddings of candidate entities for calculating similarities between entities.

Yet we need labelled data that unfortunately takes time to curate. To avoid costly cur ration in order to filter out off-topic discussions, we need positive and negative data-sources. On-line discussion forums, such as Stack Overflow, are very effective for solving programming problems. By engaging in open-data, Stack Overflow data becomes a powerful source of labelled text regarding programming. This work shows that we can train classifiers using Stack Overflow posts as positive examples of on-topic programming discussion.

However, AM and GSD are not completely compatible. On the one hand, in AM people interactions (face-to-face) are preferred over document-based communications to share knowledge. On the other hand, in GSD knowledge sharing is conducted through documents to minimize the effect of the inherent four distances (physical, temporal, language and cultural). This means that tacit knowledge is preferred in AM and explicit knowledge is preferred in GSD. These differences between AM and GSD affect many aspects of software development, for instance: Architectural Knowledge Management. According to the literature, in AGSD it is preferred to convey Architectural Knowledge (AK) by frequent interactions across sites through unstructured and textual electronic media (UTEM) (chats, emails, forums, etc.), that is, AK is articulated in these media. UTEM leave a textual record of the transmitted information, thus leaving an unstructured log of the shared AK of the project. In this paper we present an empirical study to understand AK articulation in UTEM in AGSD teams. Our results consist of an ontology that represents the involved aspects in AK articulation in UTEM in AGSD teams. Additionally, we identified eleven categories of interactions across sites through UTEM, where requirements and coding themes are prominent. Finally, we found that AK in UTEM is perceived as important, regardless the interaction frequency. These results lead us to think that a tool to structure and exploit AK in UTEM is needed in AGSD, in order to bridge the gap between AM and GSD.","2329-6313","978-1-5090-2680-7","10.1109/ICGSE.2016.29","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7577427","agile global software development;virtual teams;architectural knowledge;unstructured and textual electronic media","Companies;Software;Media;Electronic mail;Documentation;Knowledge engineering;Monitoring","","8","","40","IEEE","29 Sep 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Since each sub-network extracts different types of features due to the difference in architecture, the knowledge can be shared between the sub-networks. Through knowledge distillation, the features and predictions from each sub-network are fused together into a new fusion classifier. In addition, a cyclical learning rate can be used to generate a series of models that are combined in an ensemble, in order to yield a more generalizable prediction.

This technique emphasizes the power of brainstorming on the field of interest by the application of a visual representation of ideas. An exploration of steps to classify barriers is discussed. One of the key aims of the framework is to ensure that barriers can be classified in ways that best identify in order to find ways to remove them. A review of a large number of KM articles in the literature has identified 160 barriers to KS in a variety of organizations. These were classified into eight themes: Social, Individual, Culture, Technology, Political, Organization, Content, and Routine, procedure and process. The paper, then, discussed the most significant barriers to KS: Psychological ownership, Lack of a motivation, Lack of trust, Lack of incentive and reward systems, Lack of organization culture, Lack of leadership, Lack of technical support, Insufficient technology infrastructure. Implications and future research in this area are also proposed.","","978-1-4673-8929-7","10.1109/KSE.2016.7758032","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7758032","Knowledge management;Knowledge sharing barriers;Knowledge sharing enablers;Lotus Blossom technique","Organizations;Psychology;Creativity;Technological innovation;Knowledge management;Bibliographies;Knowledge engineering","","7","","29","IEEE","1 Dec 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this study, we differentiate between solicited KS and voluntary KS, and attempt to examine the role of both types of actual sharing behaviors in relation to: task structure, culture, and knowledge process at work unit level. We found that task structure and knowledge practices facilitate only solicited sharing behaviors, but not voluntary sharing behaviors. In addition, the results indicate that feeling of solidarity and knowledge tools are significantly related to voluntary sharing behaviors. Our results provide preliminary evidence of significant relationship between environmental antecedents and two different forms of KS.","1530-1605","978-0-7695-3075-8","10.1109/HICSS.2008.56","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4439047","","Knowledge management;Testing;Knowledge acquisition;Industrial relations;Cement industry","","7","","45","IEEE","22 Jan 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Often, solutions are developed for very similar problems over and over again. An exchange of knowledge between experts would be desirable in order to prevent developing always the same solutions by independent persons. Such an exchange could also lead to solutions of higher quality, as existing approaches could be advanced, instead of always reinventing the security wheel. This paper examines how machine-readable information security knowledge can be shared between different organizations on the basis of a web portal utilizing Web-Protege. It can be shown that through the use of ontologies the domain of information security can be modeled and stored in a human and a machine-readable format, enabling both human editing and automation (e.g. for risk calculations). The evaluation of the web portal has shown that the most important challenge a tool for knowledge sharing has to face is the aspect of motivating users to participate in a knowledge exchange.","","978-1-4673-2244-7","10.1109/ARES.2012.59","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6329225","information security;knowledge sharing;security ontology;web-based collaboration","Portals;Ontologies;Information security;Organizations;Collaboration","","6","","10","IEEE","11 Oct 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

One of the main feature of the proposed mechanism is the use of the system state knowledge sharing by system nodes, with the goal of limiting the system overhead in terms of computing, bandwidth and storage resources.

In this paper we investigated an ontology-based knowledge sharing framework to assist biologists in unraveling important roles of miRNAs in human disease in an automated and more efficient manner, (i) We developed the very first domain-specific ontologies in the miRNA field, Ontology for MicroRNA Target (OMIT), (ii) According to the global metadata model defined in ontologies, heterogeneous data sources were annotated and seamlessly integrated and stored into a central Resource Description Framework (RDF) data repository, (iii) We then enabled ontology-based queries, instead of traditional SQL queries, by inferring new statements from RDF data triples.

This has led to the adoption of knowledge management practices that provide innovation in decision making, product and process efficiency. However as organisational knowledge is greatly dependant on the tacit knowledge that its employees possess, it is important to dwell upon some human resource functional strategies to encourage sharing of employees' knowledge and also enhance employee retention. The focus of this paper is predominantly on tacit knowledge sharing. Strategies that organisations can take to share, retain and reuse tacit knowledge have been recommended. The role of the human resource function, as a key enabler of tacit knowledge transfer, has been highlighted. Employee rewards management plays a key part in promoting, creating, sharing and preserving knowledge and its vitality has been discussed. The paper also elucidates some learning and development strategies that will fundamentally aid in tacit knowledge transfer.","","978-1-4673-1090-1","10.1109/InfRKM.2012.6205014","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6205014","knowledge retention;tacit knowledge;knowledge management;reuse;human resource;knowledge sharing strategies;employee rewards management","Knowledge management;Companies;Employment;Training;Humans;Technological innovation","","6","","42","IEEE","28 May 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

One particularly useful form of intervention was face-to-face collaborative learning which increased the overall solution rate of the problem solving while also improving the strategies used. However, the collaborative intervention was not effective for all groups making complicated. To better model the effects of group composition we have developed a synchronous and symmetrical collaborative extension to the online IMMEX problem solving environment. This online collaborative environment appeared an accurate representation of the face-to-face collaboration episode in that both groupings showed similar gains in the problem solution frequency as well as in the differential use of particular strategies. We also noticed that some groups, like some individuals, rapidly developed and persisted with unproductive approaches highlighting the importance of identifying, and perhaps re-assembling such groups for subsequent problem solving. To support such decisions, we describe a causal model approach for integrating the performance and knowledge sharing histories of a group to help predict which groups should remain together.","","1-4244-0030-9","10.1109/COLCOM.2005.1651209","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1651209","","Problem-solving;History;Online Communities/Technical Collaboration;Predictive models;Chemistry;Machine learning;Artificial neural networks;Cities and towns;Telecommunications;Collaborative work","","5","1","34","IEEE","24 Jul 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Enterprise social media (ESM) offers a solution for that problem, as it is a social media that implement only for internal use and is open to all organization members. To avoid misleading implementation, organizations must understand in advance what factors affect successful ESM implementation, and also what platforms are widely used out there. This study aims to identify determinants and platforms used in the implementation of ESM in organizations. To support future research, this study also tries to identify what future works are suggested by researchers. The methodology applied in this systematic literature review uses the Kitchenham approach, with an exploration of related research published in five database sources during 2016–2021. From the data extraction of 60 final article selection results, it is found that the most mentioned determinant is clearly defined rules, manager support, fit with actual business needs, and individual motivation. For ESM platforms, Yammer is the platform that is widely used out there.

In summary, the knowledge of an organization's workforce is tacit knowledge related to their belief and expertise, which can be difficult to define, given its inexpressible characteristics. The practice of knowledge management is often associated with the use of information systems and the effort to codify, share and create knowledge using relevant knowledge management systems. Although social media is widely adopted by organizations to enhance the effectiveness of knowledge sharing practices, there is still a large amount of uncertainty on whether information systems act as an environment for the sharing of tacit knowledge. The purpose of this study is to understand the significant role of social media in offering tacit knowledge.

Based on a preliminary conceptual model, this paper examines influencing factors, such as organizational strategy, and communication flow and channels, regarding inter-team knowledge sharing (KS) effectiveness in agile environments. We analyze the characteristics and the influence of the mentioned factors through a survey research method. Data was gathered from seven Brazilian agile software organizations. We employed statistical analysis techniques, e.g., structural equation modeling and cross-table analysis, to analyze the results. Within the surveyed companies, organizational strategy reflects on moderate commitment towards knowledge. KS practices are carried out to an acceptable standard. Extensive communication flow and the use of several channels denote that agile companies are also fostering interaction across teams. We found strong relationship between these factors and the companies' experience on agile methods. As companies continue on an agile adoption program, they growingly focus on long-term goals and consider knowledge as strategic resource. However, they still need to improve strategy alignment to all organization levels. Thus, we recommend that agile companies consider these factors when striving on this endeavor.","1530-1605","978-1-4799-2504-9","10.1109/HICSS.2014.581","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6759183","Organizational factors;Inter-team Knowledge Sharing;Agile methods","Companies;Mathematical model;Context;Software;Data collection;Reliability","","2","","35","IEEE","10 Mar 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the centralized knowledge management systems may sometimes cause problems in sharing knowledge. One potential solution is to conduct KS in a decentralized network supported by peer-to-peer technology. While extensive research has been done to address the flaws of current reputation-based feedback mechanisms for promoting knowledge diffusion in peer-to-peer communities, some serious drawbacks of feedback mechanisms, namely dimensionality and interaction-dependency effects, have been overlooked. Using an agent-based simulation, this paper examines these effects while also considering characteristics of the community. Results of our simulation show interesting findings, for example, that negligence of knowledge dimensionality and interaction-dependency in designing reputation mechanisms has a major negative effect on community knowledge performance. Further, more complex knowledge adversely affects community-level diffusion outcomes whereas greater network density improves them.","1530-1605","978-0-7695-4892-0","10.1109/HICSS.2013.376","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6480274","","Communities;Peer-to-peer computing;Knowledge engineering;Complexity theory;Discussion forums;Context;Organizations","","2","","23","IEEE","18 Mar 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Consequently, novice teachers are currently facing critical challenges when delivering subject knowledge that relates to algorithms, programming and the development of computational thinking skills without the benefit of others' experience. After a study of the relevant literature, it could be seen that far too little attention has been paid to the capturing and sharing of TPs which are not easily expressed or communicated in visual or verbal terms. Thus, we design and then demonstrate a Teaching Practices Management System (TPMS) which supports the capturing of TPs.

In this study, we aim to improve the training of class-conditional GANs with long-tailed data. We propose a straightforward yet effective method for knowledge sharing, allowing tail classes to borrow from the rich information from classes with more abundant training data. More concretely, we propose modifications to existing class-conditional GAN architectures to ensure that the lower-resolution layers of the generator are trained entirely unconditionally while reserving class-conditional generation for the higher-resolution layers.

The results reveal the following: (1) Trust is critical for ensuring supply-chain stability, and changes in the trust level of high-tech shipbuilding enterprises significantly affect sharing relationships in the supply chain. (2) Both incentives and penalties can increase the stability of strategy choices and improve the strategy convergence rate of the two players. Penalties, however, can improve the convergence rate more so than incentives, while incentives can help both players evolve more steadily toward a stable strategy.

We found that high levels of spreadsheet self-efficacy and a perception that sharing would result in reputational gains predicted higher KS intention, but individuals who found knowledge codification effortful showed lower KS intention. We also observed that regardless of occupation, users tended to report a lower sense of self-efficacy in their general spreadsheet proficiency, despite also reporting high self-efficacy in spreadsheet use for job-related contexts.

In our paper, we design, implement, and evaluate a new learning management system (LMS) specifically for lecturers following a design science research approach to perform a proof of concept and to assess the acceptance within the community. We gather the requirements for this LMS by performing a literature review, and afterward, we build a web application as an artefact prototype and evaluate it in an exploratory focus group. The developed LMS covers basic functionalities, user control, and collaboration tools to support communication between lecturers. Other features include the upload and management of courses and their contents. An innovative aspect of this work is individualized content provision based on the learning asset’s metadata. Currently, the underlying algorithm takes the chosen keywords into account, but additional meta-fields can already be gathered for further development. The prototype evaluation resulted in a system usability score of 63, which can be considered good, and the product received a positive acceptance among the evaluation participants.

Basically software agents can encode users profiles with detailed information to be related with specific groups. This work discusses a multi-agent framework whose structure focuses on the role of software agents and the use of a common, shared dictionary for each group. Personal software agents are associated to OSN users to share knowledge for a specific theme for a number of groups related to that topic. Group agents are defined to support each group on each OSN by interacting with personal agents to manage group affiliation and enrich the common dictionaries of their own groups. The common dictionary of the group is a key element to provide knowledge sharing and interoperability between personal and group agents. In the proposed approach each user agent is able to personalize its own dictionary and enrich that of its own groups by means of selected categories.","","978-1-4799-8870-9","10.1109/CISIS.2015.71","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7185235","Online Social Network;Knoledge sharing;Common Dictionary;Intelligent Agents;Thematic Group","Dictionaries;Ontologies;Social network services;Photography;Software agents;Cameras;Indexes","","","","18","IEEE","13 Aug 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

One of the most successful KSNets is Wikipedia that allows users to create contents in a collaborative manner and to provide fast and easy access at no cost to users. Recent research, however, has shown that the numbers of “Wikipedians” and new page creations have been declining, reflecting decrease in user contributions and in new contents. To facilitate management for sustainability, this paper aims at quantitatively modeling how the decline in new contents affects the number of Wikipedians and in turn content creations, and predicting decline start time and speed based on available Wikipedia data. The novel modeling approach adopts auto-regression with an extended Bass Diffusion model (AREBDM) embedded to describe the Wikipedia-wide evolutions of the number of Wikipedians and content developments. Model parameters are then extracted by a nonlinear least square method from early Wikipedia data. Simulation predictions match well with actual Wikipedia decline trajectories of later stages. Our analysis shows that the decline of new page creation leads in time the decline of the number of new Wikipedians, and the decline speed increases with the decrease of new contents. Our approach therefore has the potential to predict decline time and speed so that proactive actions can be taken as early as possible.","2576-3555","978-1-5386-5065-3","10.1109/CoDIT.2018.8394797","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8394797","","Encyclopedias;Electronic publishing;Internet;Data models;Technological innovation;Analytical models","","","","28","IEEE","25 Jun 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, AI services still heavily rely on high-performance computing systems, which means that these devices are not being effectively utilized. To address these issues, EdgeCPS technology has emerged. EdgeCPS is a technology that supports the seamless execution of various services, including AI applications, through the interconnection of edge devices and edge servers, as well as resource and function augmentation. In order to appropriately utilize edge devices in an EdgeCPS environment, the paper proposes an EdgeCPS-AI knowledge sharing model for supporting computing partition services. The proposed EdgeCPS-AI knowledge is represented as a graph, which systematically structures AI service-related information that arises on virtual and physical edge devices. This knowledge provides not only partitioned AI weighted models in order to support the characteristics of EdgeCPS, but also enables flexible provision of various information required for AI services. Thus, this approach can facilitate the reconstruction of AI services according to service requirements and maximize the utilization of edge devices. To achieve this, a microservice-based computing partition AI service is devised and experimentally proven by constructing a Kubernetes system using 8 heterogeneous edge devices and a graph DB system consisting of 2,762 nodes. Experimental results show that performing computing partition services on edge devices is significantly more efficient in terms of overall resource consumption, with up to 85.57% improvement, as compared to performing the same tasks on high-performance computing systems.","2577-1655","979-8-3503-3702-0","10.1109/SMC53992.2023.10394602","Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute (ETRI)(grant numbers:21ZS1300); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10394602","Edge Cps;EdgeCPS-AI knowledge;Kubernetes;graph DB;Computing partition","Performance evaluation;Computational modeling;High performance computing;Microservice architectures;Servers;Artificial intelligence;Task analysis","","","","9","IEEE","29 Jan 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, prior studies identified that developers may suffer from the redundant, useless, and incomplete information retrieved by the Stack Overflow search engine. To help developers better utilize the Stack Overflow knowledge, researchers proposed tools to summarize answers to a Stack Overflow question. However, existing tools use hand-craft features to assess the usefulness of each answer sentence and fail to remove semantically redundant information in the result. Besides, existing tools only focus on a certain programming language and cannot retrieve up-to-date new posted knowledge from Stack Overflow. In this paper, we propose TECHSUMBOT, an automatic answer summary generation tool for a technical problem. Given a question, TECH-SUMBOT first retrieves answers using the Stack Overflow search engine, then TECHSUMBOT 1) ranks each answers sentence based on the sentence's usefulness, 2) estimates the centrality of each sentence to all candidates, and 3) removes the semantic redundant information. Finally, TECHSUMBOT returns the top 5 ranked answer sentences as the answer summary. We implement TECHSUMBOT in the form of a search engine website. To evalu-ate TECHSUMBOT in both automatic and manual manners, we construct the first Stack Overflow multi-answer summarization benchmark and design a manual evaluation study to assess the effectiveness of TECHSUMBOT and state-of-the-art baselines from the NLP and SE domain. Both results indicate that the summaries generated by TECHSUMBOT are more diverse, useful, and similar to the ground truth summaries.

Programmers tap into this crowd knowledge through web browsers. This requires them to step out of their integrated development environments (IDE), formulate a query, inspect the returned results and manually port the solution back to the IDE. We present an integrated and largely automated approach to assist programmers who want to leverage the crowd knowledge of Q&A services. We give a form to our approach by implementing Seahawk, an Eclipse plugin. Seahawk automatically formulates queries from the current context in the IDE, and presents a ranked and interactive list of results.

Hence, identifying topical experts is necessary to improve the efficacy of these systems in terms of both response time and quality. Although expert detection in CQA forums has traditionally been a topic of wide interest, however, many of the proposed techniques use features set that reflect the popularity of the responses of the responder rather than the difficulty level of the questions being responded. In this paper we provide measures of labeling difficult questions and use the number of difficult questions responded by a user combined with other user interaction parameters in identifying potential topical experts.

Finally, we compare the used buffer size and the declared buffer size to identify the stack overflow vulnerability.

Hence, developers reusing code from Stack Overflow for their OSS projects may violate licensing agreements if their attributions are not correct. Additionally, if code migrates from one OSS through Stack Overflow to another OSS, then complex licensing issues are likely to exist. Such forms of software reuse also have implications for future software maintenance, particularly where developers have poor understanding of copied code. This paper investigates code reuse between these two platforms (i.e., Stack Overflow and OSS), with the aim of providing insights into this issue. This study mined 151,946 Java code snippets from Stack Overflow, 16,617 Java files from 12 of the top weekly listed projects on SourceForge and GitHub, and 39,616 Java files from the top 20 most popular Java projects on SourceForge. Our analyses were aimed at finding the number of clones (indicating reuse) (a) within Stack Overflow posts, (b) between Stack Overflow and popular Java OSS projects, and (c) between the projects. Outcomes reveal that there was up to 3.3% code reuse within Stack Overflow, while 1.0% of Stack Overflow code was reused in recent popular Java projects and 2.3% in those projects that were more established. Reuse across projects was much higher, accounting for as much as 77.2%. Our outcomes have implication for strategies aimed at introducing strict quality assurance measures to ensure the appropriateness of code reuse, and licensing requirements awareness.","2377-5408","978-1-7281-1241-1","10.1109/ASWEC.2018.00027","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8587298","Code reuse;Stack Overflow;Java projects;OSS;Q&A;Quality","Licenses;Software;Java;Law;Cloning;Portals","","13","","40","IEEE","27 Dec 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Stack Overflow users may make edits to questions for a variety of reasons, among others, to improve the question and try to obtain more answers. However, to date the relationship between edit actions on questions and the number of answers that they collect is unknown. In this paper, we perform an empirical study on Stack Overflow to understand the relationship between edit actions and number of answers obtained in different dimensions from different attributes of the edited questions. We find that questions are more commonly edited by question owners, on bodies with relatively big changes before obtaining an accepted answer.

Roughly 53% of closed Stack Overflow posts are closed due to duplication. Despite their supposed overlapping content, user activity suggests duplicates may generate additional or superior answers. Approximately 9% of duplicates receive more views than their original counterparts despite being closed. In this paper, we analyze duplicate questions from two perspectives. First, we analyze the experience of those who post duplicates using activity and reputation-based heuristics. Second, we compare the content of duplicates both in terms of their questions and answers to determine the degree of similarity between each duplicate pair. Through analysis of the MSR challenge dataset, we find that although duplicate questions are more likely to be created by inexperienced users, they often receive dissimilar answers to their original counterparts. Indeed, supplementary textual analysis using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques suggests duplicate questions provide additional information about the underlying concepts being discussed.

Therefore, it is important to understand the meaning of a high-reputation point and if the reputation could be used as a good indicator for users' expertise and experience on Stack Overflow.

However, navigating numerous posts to find relevant answers is time-consuming. Recent research suggests summarizing SO post answers into concise summaries to quickly assess their relevance and quality. Existing approaches to this problem, though yielding promising results, predominantly employ information retrieval techniques or utilize pre-trained models to identify and extract salient sentences for summaries. Typically, these studies consider sentences in isolation, overlooking both the contextual relationships with neighboring sentences and the connection between the answer and the input query, thereby diminishing the effectiveness of the summarizer. This work introduces LASSO as an effective approach for summarizing Stack Overflow post answers. Our contributions are twofold. Firstly, we focus on extracting the contextual relationships between sentences to determine their salience in contributing to the summary. This involves using a BERT encoder combined with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models, ensuring that the final representation of each sentence captures both its inherent semantics and the contextual information from the entire answer. Empirical evaluations and a human study demonstrate that LASSO outperforms established baselines by producing more concise summaries of Stack Overflow post answers. Secondly, we enhance the state-of-the-art dataset for Stack Overflow post summarization by introducing an additional dataset, which has been shown to improve the performance of baseline models, thereby advancing research in sentence-level summarization of various textual software artifacts.","2576-3148","979-8-3503-9568-6","10.1109/ICSME58944.2024.00062","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10795030","pre-trained model;LSTM;summarization;stack overflow","Software maintenance;Navigation;Semantics;Diversity reception;Programming;Transformers;Information retrieval;Encoding;Long short term memory;Software engineering","","","","24","IEEE","19 Dec 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It is unclear, thus, how the privacy concerns and their correlation with user behavior in an online social network translate into a CQA platform. This study analyzes one year of recorded traces from a mature CQA platform to understand the association between users' privacy concerns as manifested by their account settings and their activity in the platform. The results show that privacy preference is correlated with behavior in the community in terms of engagement, retention, accomplishments and deviance from the norm. We find privacy-concerned users have higher qualitative and quantitative contributions, show higher retention, report more abuses, have higher perception on answer quality and have larger social circles. However, at the same time, these users also exhibit more deviant behavior than the users with public profiles.","","978-1-4503-3854-7","10.1145/2808797.2809422","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7403616","Community question answering;privacy concerns;crowdsourcing","Privacy;Facebook;Knowledge discovery;Guidelines;Correlation;Data privacy","","2","","40","","11 Feb 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Five models including Language Model, Translation-based Language Model, Parser-based model, LDA and WordNet source-based model are selected as baselines. Integrated models which linearly combine WordNet, Stanford Parser and Language Model and further weighted by syntactic feature are proposed to integrate features of the three aspects.

While this may lead to a 'quick fix' for a development problem, little is known about how these copied code snippets affect the code quality of the recipient application, or how the quality of the recipient classes subsequently evolve over the time of the project. This has an impact on whether such code copying should be encouraged, and how classes that receive such code snippets should be monitored during evolution. To investigate this issue, we used instances from the SOTorrent database where Java snippets had been copied from Stack Overflow into GitHub projects. In each case, we measured the quality of the recipient class just prior to the addition of the snippet, immediately after the addition of the snippet, and at a later stage in the project. Our goal was to determine if the addition of the snippet caused quality to improve or deteriorate, and what the long-term implications were for the quality of the recipient class. Code quality was measured using the cohesion metrics Low-level Similarity-based Class Cohesion (LSCC) and Class Cohesion (CC). Over a random sample of 378 classes that received code snippets copied from Stack Overflow to GitHub, we found that in almost 70% of the cases where the copied snippet affected cohesion, the effect was to reduce the cohesion of the recipient class. Furthermore, this deterioration in cohesion tends to persist in the subsequent evolution of the recipient class. In over 70% of cases the recipient class never fully regained the cohesion it lost in receiving the snippet. These results suggest that when copying code snippets from external repositories, more attention should be paid to integrating the code with the recipient class.","2574-3864","978-1-7281-3412-3","10.1109/MSR.2019.00050","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8816758","Quality, Cohesion, Metrics, Evolution","Measurement;Java;Cloning;History;Computer bugs;Market research;Software","","5","","10","IEEE","29 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Programmers of all skill levels post questions and answers to Stack Overflow which may contain snippets of source code along with corresponding text and tags. Many snippets do not parse, thus they are ripe for forming a corpus of syntax errors and corrections. Our primary contribution is an approach for extracting natural syntax errors and their corresponding human made fixes to help syntax error research. A Python abstract syntax tree parser is used to determine preliminary errors and corrections on code blocks extracted from the SOTorrent data set. We further analyzed our code by executing the corrections in a Python interpreter. We applied our methodology to produce a public data set of 62,965 Python Stack Overflow code snippets with corresponding tags, errors, and stack traces. We found that errors made by Stack Overflow users do not match errors made by student developers or random mutations, implying there is a serious representativeness risk within the field.

Response time of a question is an important aspect in these sites as it is associated with the users' satisfaction and engagement, and thus the lifespan of these online communities. In this paper we study and estimate response time for questions in StackOverflow, a popular online Q&A forum where software developers post and answer questions related to programming. We analyze a long list of factors in the data and identify those that have clear relation with response time. Our key finding is that tag-related factors, such as their “popularity” (how often the tag is used) and the number of their “subscribers” (how many users can answer questions containing the tag), provide much stronger evidence than factors not related to tags. Finally, we learn models using the identified evidential features for predicting the response time of questions, which also demonstrate the significance of tags chosen by the question asker.","","978-1-4799-5877-1","10.1109/ASONAM.2014.6921605","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6921605","online communities;question answering sites;collective intelligence;question response time;user engagement;human behavior;evidential feature analysis","Time factors;Correlation;Social network services;Conferences;Programming;Predictive models;Internet","","31","","18","IEEE","16 Oct 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper demonstrates the benefits of extracting crowd knowledge from Stack Overflow by analyzing well-known open source repositories such as OpenNLP and Elasticsearch: Up to one third of the source code in the examined repositories reuses code patterns from Stack Overflow. It also shows that the proposed approach recognizes similar source code and is resilient to modifications such as insertion, deletion and swapping of statements.

Accurate demand prediction is the key to support timely re-balancing and ensure service efficiency. Most existing models of bike-sharing demand prediction are solely based on its own historical demand variation, essentially regarding bike sharing as a closed system and neglecting the interaction between different transport modes. This is particularly important because bike sharing is often used to complement travel through other modes (e.g., public transit). Despite some recent efforts, there is no existing method capable of leveraging spatiotemporal information from multiple modes with heterogeneous spatial units. To address this research gap, this study proposes a graph-based deep learning approach for bike sharing demand prediction (B-MRGNN) with multimodal historical data as input. The spatial dependencies across modes are encoded with multiple intra- and inter-modal graphs. A multi-relational graph neural network (MRGNN) is introduced to capture correlations between spatial units across modes, such as bike sharing stations, subway stations, or ride-hailing zones. Extensive experiments are conducted using real-world bike sharing, subway and ride-hailing data from New York City, and the results demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed approach compared to existing methods.","","978-1-6654-6880-0","10.1109/ITSC55140.2022.9922276","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9922276","bike sharing;demand prediction;inter-modal relationships;graph neural networks;deep learning","Deep learning;Correlation;Convolution;Urban areas;Information sharing;Predictive models;Spatiotemporal phenomena","","6","","20","IEEE","1 Nov 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Such technology-mediated learning environments based on the potential of Web 2.0 and free/open social software tend to be more open, networked and distributed. What we can see now in online education realm is perhaps a paradigm shift from less institutionalized learning management systems to more flexible student-centered learning environments as it is called Personal Learning Environments (PLE). Such networked and distributed learning environments seem to have the potential of bringing various opportunities and resources for learners. This paper, by describing a PLE as a set of learner-defined tools and services, highlights how participants in open online courses use a variety of tools and resources as their PLEs for searching, aggregating, creating and sharing contents. In this online ethnographic research design, data was gathered through an online survey, semi-structured interviews and online artifacts from the participants in three open online courses. This work also draws attention to study how serendipitous discoveries and kind of emerging learning might occur by being immersed in the abundance of resources and engaged in various online networks and communities. The results of the initial yet-in-progress analysis of this study suggest evidences of serendipity and emergent learning in open online contexts.","","978-1-4673-2427-4","10.1109/ICL.2012.6402224","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6402224","Personal learning environment;PLE;open online learning;content aggregation;serendipity;emergent learning;MOOC","Context;Blogs;Knowledge engineering;Social network services;Educational institutions","","5","","36","IEEE","7 Jan 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To achieve this goal, we precisely express the requirements needed to control the shared information. In addition, we define a formal framework for specifying security policies governing contributions requests according to user profile. We present also a prototype implementing the functionalities of our system. In our approach, a new user has limited rights. On an ongoing basis, if he demonstrates his ability to produce good contributions, he gains new privileges. Conversely, if he often generates contributions with a questionable content, he loses the held privileges. Therefore, granting user requests depends closely on his previous behavior (the history). Indeed, our system encourages users to adopt a responsible attitude by focusing on the reliability of the content of their contributions instead of their frequency. Consequently, WiseShare permits to significantly minimize clumsy and malicious actions.","","978-1-4673-2740-4","10.4108/icst.collaboratecom.2012.250402","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6450889","Collaborative environments;knowledge sharing;attribute based access control","Runtime","","2","","12","","7 Feb 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Here it is argued that further extensions are needed, in particular, more robust understandings of knowledge in a collaborative context and of enterprise interoperability, and identification and creation of collaborative structures, especially for more complex collaborative projects and ventures. The nature of robust inter-organizational collaborative behaviour relies upon several layers of hard software development integrated with the soft engineering knowledge processes. Long-lived interoperability activities expose the need for systemic, collaborative awareness to achieve continual, emergent survival. The successful exchange between platforms and tools with collaborative structures and policies is an activity that can only succeed with approaches that do not attempt to reduce the working mechanisms that separate working parts of a whole.","","978-1-4673-2275-1","10.1109/ICE.2012.6297696","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6297696","Collaboration;interoperability;Inter-organizational collaborative software development;knowledge management;collaboration engineering","Collaboration;Software;Technological innovation;Knowledge engineering;Knowledge management","","1","","31","IEEE","10 Sep 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The exploration procedure is exclusively induced by a memory-based probabilistic sequential action selection method acting as a knowledge hub, shared among the agents, which is the central pillar of this work. This causes enhancing the parallelism of the learning process, plus, building an effective yet simple communicating-bridge between the learning agents; that is, they can signal and guide one another through sharing their gained experience and knowledge in order not to repeat the same mistake that the other agents have already run into.

The most appreciated feature of a learning game is to provide in an automatic way to each learner an integrated feedback in real time during the game and, ideally, a personally meaningful debriefing at the end of each session. Immersive learning games use virtual reality and 3D environments to allow several learners at once to collaborate in the most natural way. Managing the communication on the other hand has proven so far a more difficult problem to overcome. In this article, we present a communication system designed to be used in immersive learning games. This innovative system is neither based on voice-chat nor branching dialogues but on the idea that pieces of information can be manipulated as tangible objects in a virtual environment. This system endeavours to offer the simplest and most intuitive way for several learners to acquire and share knowledge in an immersive virtual environment while complying with the requirements of a reliable assessment of their performance. A first experiment with nurse anaesthetist students gives evidence that this simple communication system is apt to support lifelike behaviours such as consultation, debate, conflict or irritation.","","978-1-4799-8102-1","10.1109/VS-GAMES.2015.7295768","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7295768","","Games;Context;Communication systems;Surgery;Collaboration;Real-time systems;Virtual environments","","1","","14","IEEE","12 Oct 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper we reflect upon our experience in the HealthAgents project wherein a prototype system was developed and a novel approach employed that supports data transfer and decision making in human brain tumour diagnosis. Here we examine the capability of the lightweight coordination calculus (LCC), a process calculus-based language, in combining together distributed healthcare services and meeting security challenges in pervasive settings. The result is that various clinical specialisms, being captured in representational abstractions and making contribution to patient diagnosis and management, retain their autonomy. However, at the same time, the behaviour of specialists in sharing clinical knowledge about their patients and providing clinical support is constrained by policies and rules in respect of their own clinical duties and responsibilities. Being introduced into the programme of the HRB Centre for Primary Care Research, this novel approach has the potential to help the provision of optimal solutions in data linkage and sharing across the primary and cecondary care interface. As added value, its application also advances the process of integrating clinical prediction rules and implementing CDSSs in practice and, ultimately, the improvement of quality of care.","1330-1012","978-953-7138-15-8","10.1109/ITI.2009.5196061","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5196061","Clinical decision support;healthcare knowledge sharing;Lightweight Coordination Calculus;patient privacy","Privacy;Decision support systems;Medical services;Diseases;Medical treatment;History;Light scattering;Prototypes;Decision making;Humans","","","","10","","7 Aug 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To the nearly end-of-life product, the machinery must be re-launched as fast as possible so that the MNEs will have more time to gain the profit. Therefore, the tacit knowledge of the machine experts is needed to be created and transformed into the explicit knowledge. Then, the technician community will be able to learn and handle the old machinery maintenance rapidly and correctly. However, without the motivation, the tacit knowledge elicitation is usually slow. Thus, this paper tries to propose a serious game as a motivation tool to quickly elicit the tacit knowledge. The case study of a Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in Thailand was introduced.

Although reuse can be performed in a systematic way (e.g., through product lines), in practice, reuse is performed in many cases opportunistically, i.e., copying small code chunks either from the web or in-house developed projects. Knowledge sharing communities and especially StackOverflow constitute the primary source of code-related information for amateur and professional software developers. Despite the obvious benefit of increased productivity, reuse can have a mixed effect on the quality of the resulting code depending on the properties of the reused solutions. An efficient concept for capturing a wide-range of internal software qualities is the metaphor of Technical Debt which expresses the impact of shortcuts in software development on its maintenance costs. In this paper, we present the results of an empirical study on the relation between the existence of reusing code retrieved from StackOverflow on the technical debt of the target system. In particular, we study several open-source projects and identify non-trivial pieces of code that exhibit a perfect or near-perfect match with code provided in the context of answers in StackOverflow. Then, we compare the technical debt density of the reused fragments, obtained as the ratio of inefficiencies identified by SonarQube over the lines of reused code, to the technical debt density of the target codebase. The results provide insights to the potential impact of small-scale code reuse on technical debt and highlight the benefits of assessing code quality before committing changes to a repository.","","978-1-7281-3421-5","10.1109/SEAA.2019.00022","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8906702","Technical Debt;StackOverflow;Code Reuse;Software Quality","Cloning;Java;Tools;Software quality;Systematics;Current measurement","","12","","19","IEEE","21 Nov 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Both platforms can offer valuable assistance to programmers, but it's unclear which is more effective at enhancing programmer productivity. In our paper, we conducted an exploratory user study to compare the performance of Stack Overflow and ChatGPT in enhancing programmer productivity. Two groups of students with similar programming abilities were instructed to use the two platforms to solve three different types of programming tasks: algorithmic challenges, library usage, and debugging. During the experiments, we measured and compared the quality of code produced and the time taken to complete tasks for the two groups. The results show that, concerning code quality, ChatGPT outperforms Stack Overflow significantly in helping complete algorithmic and library-related tasks, while Stack Overflow is better for debugging tasks. Regarding task completion speed, the ChatGPT group is obviously faster than the Stack Overflow group in the algorithmic challenge, but the two groups have a similar performance in the other two tasks. Additionally, we conducted a post-experiment survey with the participants to understand how the platforms have helped them complete the programming tasks. We analyzed the questionnaires to summarize ChatGPT and Stack Overflow's strengths and weaknesses pointed out by the participants.

Crowdsourcing offers substantial benefits to the involved parties. For crowdworkers, crowdsourcing offers flexibility in terms of time, locations and durations of doing tasks given to them and the most important is crowdsourcing will give them additional income to complement existing income that will help them to uplift their lifestyle. To organizations, crowdsourcing offers access to pool of talents or skills from all over the world which would not be economically feasible to maintain in-house or acquire out of house. In addition, faster execution as the tasks can be completed without having to hire or/ and train new employees. Since crowdsourcing is considered as a new business concept which involves different integrations of crowd worker, job provider and crowdsourcing web based platform, proper crowdsourcing initiatives need to be strategically planned and evaluated. Hence, this study will look into one of crowdsourcing important part which is crowdsourcing business model. Business models are very crucial as it will explain a plan for the successful operation of a business, identifying sources of revenue, the intended customer base, products, and details of financing. This paper reviews the existing business model of crowdsourcing and critical analysis for each business model.","","978-1-4673-6716-5","10.1109/ICSGRC.2015.7412466","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7412466","Crowdsourcing;Business Model;Platform;Crowdworker;Crowd","Crowdsourcing;Outsourcing;Organizations;Analytical models;Standards organizations;Focusing","","5","1","23","IEEE","25 Feb 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, crowdsourcing software development involves complex tasks which differ significantly from the micro-tasks that can be found on crowdsourcing platforms such as Amazon Mechanical Turk - the latter are much shorter in duration, and typically very simple and do not involve any task interdependencies. To achieve the potential benefits of crowdsourcing in the software development context, companies need to understand how this strategy works, what challenges arise, and what factors might affect crowd participation. Research to date on crowdsourcing software development has tended to focus on the 'crowd' or the technical platform, with little research from the perspective of the customer who is seeking to leverage the crowdsourcing development model. The findings from an in-depth case study of crowd-sourcing software development in a Fortune 500 company are augmented with an analysis of over 13,000 crowdsourcing competitions over a ten-year period on the Topcoder crowdsourcing platform, one of the most popular platforms for software development, are drawn on to evaluate the effectiveness of crowdsourcing in a software development context","","978-1-5386-8404-7","10.1109/AIRE.2018.00010","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8501307","Crowdsourcing software development","Software;Crowdsourcing;Conferences;Software engineering;Companies;Artificial intelligence;Requirements engineering","","2","","6","IEEE","21 Oct 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

When developers fail to find solutions on Q&A sites in their native language (e.g., Chinese), they could translate their query and search on the Q&A sites in another language (e.g., English). However, developers who are non-native English speakers often are not comfortable to ask or search questions in English, as they do not know the proper translation of the Chinese technical words into the English technical words. Furthermore, the process of manually formulating cross-language queries and determining the weight of query words is a tedious and time-consuming process. For the purpose of helping Chinese developers take advantage of the rich knowledge base of the English version of Stack Overflow and simplify the retrieval process, we propose an automated crosslanguage relevant question retrieval (CLRQR) system to retrieve relevant English questions on Stack Overflow for a given Chinese question. Our CLRQR system first extracts essential information (both Chinese and English) from the title and description of the input Chinese question, then performs domain-specific translation of the essential Chinese information into English, and formulates a query with highest-scored English words for retrieving relevant questions in a repository of 684,599 Java questions in English from Stack Overflow. To evaluate the performance of our proposed approach, we also propose four online retrieval approaches as baselines. We randomly select 80 Java questions in SegmentFault and V2EX (two Chinese Q&A websites for computer programming) as the query Chinese questions. Each approach returns top-10 most relevant questions for a given Chinese question. We invite 5 users to evaluate the relevance of the retrieved English questions. The experiment results show that CLRQR system outperforms the four baseline approaches, and the statistical tests show the improvements are significant.","","978-1-4503-4186-8","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7832920","Domain-Specific Translation;Cross-Language Question Retrieval","Java;Frequency-domain analysis;Vocabulary;Algorithm design and analysis;Data mining;Computers;Software","","1","","35","","26 Jan 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As the popularity of these communities has grown over the years, both the number of members and posts have escalated. Also, due to the diverse backgrounds, skills, expertise, and viewpoints of users, each question may obtain more than one answer. Therefore, the focus has changed toward producing posts that have a set of answers more valuable for the community as a whole, not just one accepted-answer aimed at satisfying only the question-asker. Same as every universal community, a large number of low-quality posts on Stack Overflow require improvement. We call these posts ""deficient"", and define them as posts with questions that either have no answer yet or can be improved by other ones. In this paper, we propose an approach to automate the identification process of such posts and boost their set of answers, utilizing the help of related experts. With the help of 60 participants, we trained a classification model to identify deficient posts by investigating the relationship between characteristics of 3075 questions posted on Stack Overflow and their need for better answers set. Then, we developed an Eclipse plugin named SOPI and integrated the prediction model in the plugin to link these deficient posts to related developers (in terms of their development context and expertise area) and help them improve the answer set. We evaluated both the functionality of our plugin and the impact of answers submitted to Stack Overflow with the help of 10 and 15 expert industrial developers, respectively. Our results indicate that decision trees, specifically the J48 algorithm, predicts a deficient question better than the other methods with 94.5% precision and 90.3% recall. We conclude that not only our plugin helps programmers contribute more easily to Stack Overflow, but also it improves the quality of existing answers.","","978-1-7281-9532-2","10.1109/SEAA51224.2020.00084","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9226292","Question Answering;Prediction Models;Machine Learning;Recommender systems","Predictive models;Java;Synthetic aperture sonar;Support vector machines;Software;Labeling;Decision trees","","4","","19","IEEE","16 Oct 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, since gender is not explicitly recorded, it is typically inferred by automatic “gender guessers”, based on cues derived from an individual's online presence, such as their name and profile picture. As opposed to self-reporting, used in earlier studies, gender guessers scale better, but their accuracy depends on the quantity and quality of data available in one's online profile.

We have developed a prototype of our key-agreement protocol to evaluate its feasibility and performance. Our results show that both time and message overhead of our protocol are linear in key length.

The significance of precise tagging for optimal content management is underscored, noting how tag inaccuracies can lead to search inefficiencies and reduced platform effectiveness. The core of this study is the introduction of an innovative automated tagging system designed specifically for Stack Overflow. As a principal case study, Stack Overflow, renowned for its extensive collection of programming-related queries and solutions, provides a fertile ground for testing and refining our system. Our system leverages various elements such as the question’s title, description, and embedded code snippets to recommend pertinent tags, thereby aiming to refine and expedite the tagging process. It starts with question preprocessing, followed by a two-step candidate tag extraction. The first step utilizes the YAKE algorithm for initial tag extraction, and the second involves using MPNET for question embedding. This is complemented by methods like multi-label k-nearest neighbor, multi-label Random Forest, and Cosine Similarity for further tag extraction. The process then moves to tag selection and pruning, eliminating overlaps, and concludes with tag sorting.We assess our system’s performance using metrics such as F1-score, Recall, and Precision. Our experimental results show a notable improvement over existing baseline methods, with our approach achieving a substantial 3.4% enhancement in performance compared to the most effective baseline. This indicates the potential of our system to significantly advance tag-based categorization in question-and-answer platforms.","2640-5768","979-8-3503-8394-2","10.1109/AISP61396.2024.10475258","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10475258","Automatic Question Tagging;Stack Overflow;Tag;Deep Neural Network","Measurement;Systematics;Refining;Organizations;Tagging;Signal processing;Robustness","","","","26","IEEE","25 Mar 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we propose approaches to enhance the RDF triples in knowledge bases, which is significant for providing good information retrieval service. Specifically, we utilize data facts stored in database systems to obtain possible updates for knowledge bases. Furthermore, inspired by the popular and successful applications of crowdsourcing platforms, we explore the use of crowdsourcing to verify the updates. We propose KD graph to model the possible updates and design a comprehensive framework for knowledge base enhancement problem. Since crowdsourcing employs human power and requires expenditure, we propose an optimal and dynamic method to select candidates for crowdsourcing within a limited budget so that the benefit of enhancing the knowledge base can be maximized. To reduce the time cost, we adopt split techniques and design Simple Split(SS) and Dynamic Split(DS) algorithms.

Such large organizations can also be government organizations. What is crowdsourcing? It is a messy umbrella term that has become all things to all people. Specifically, our focus is on paid crowdsourcing: hire the testers through the cloud from uTest; hire coders through the cloud from Topcoder; hire the corporate graphic designer through the cloud from freelancer.com or 99designs.com; for the massive digitation project, hire microtaskers at mobileworker.com. The governance issues are similar to generic sourcing governance. However, there are some special dimensions that may be more acute for crowdsourcing. I will focus on five dimensions of interest: quality, risks in IP and privacy, risks in project control, risks in organizational reputation because of exploitation, and management of the crowd itself. A significant number of U.S. enterprises are dabbling in crowdsourcing - some of them spending in excess of one million USD. But these projects are still small, scattered, occasionally skunk-works. And the enterprise managers who pioneer crowdsourcing have few peer networks and no benchmarking.","","978-1-4799-4141-4","10.1109/ITPRO.2014.7029284","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7029284","","Crowdsourcing;Educational institutions;Organizations;Books;Information technology;Abstracts;Technological innovation","","","","1","IEEE","5 Feb 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Aims: To guide SO members on how to make a good question, we conduct an empirical study using the publicly available Stack Overflow Data Dump for the period of 2008-2016. Method: We first choose 25 features along 5 dimensions to represent the textual characteristics that we are interested in. Making use of the Boruta algorithm, we then capture all features that are either strongly or weakly relevant to the question quality. Results: The results show that the number of tags and code snippets are the most discriminative features, whereas there is only a weak correlation between the question quality and the sentiment-related factors. Based on the empirical evidence, we provide useful and usable suggestions to SO members on how to optimize their questions. Conclusions: We consider that our findings will provide SO members with a better understanding of the patterns behind high-quality questions, this is to support effective and efficient utilization of Q&A websites as the ultimate goal.","","978-1-5386-3681-7","10.1109/APSEC.2017.77","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8305994","Stack Overflow;Q&A website;textual feature;Boruta algorithm;empirical software engineering","Feature extraction;Correlation;Software engineering;Readability metrics;Indexes;Computer science;Knowledge engineering","","4","","24","IEEE","5 Mar 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We develop several research questions on this theme, and draw on data from StackOverflow (SO) to address these questions. The goal of this research is to support career planning and staff development for programmers by identifying age-related trends in SO data.

Solving coding problems in a short time is important, so these CQAs have a considerable impact on the software development process. However, if developers do not get their expected answers, the websites will not be useful, and software development time will increase. Stack Overflow is the most popular CQA concerning programming problems. According to its rules, the only sign that shows a question poser has achieved the desired answer is the user’s acceptance. In this paper, we investigate unresolved questions, without accepted answers, on Stack Overflow. The number of unresolved questions is increasing. As of August 2019, 47% of Stack Overflow questions were unresolved. In this study, we analyze the effectiveness of various features, including some novel features, to resolve a question. We do not use the features that contain information not present at the time of asking a question, such as answers. To evaluate our features, we deploy several predictive models trained on the features of 18 million questions to predict whether a question will get an accepted answer or not. The results of this study show a significant relationship between our proposed features and getting accepted answers. Finally, we introduce an online tool that predicts whether a question will get an accepted answer or not. Currently, Stack Overflow’s users do not receive any feedback on their questions before asking them, so they could carelessly ask unclear, unreadable, or inappropriately tagged questions. By using this tool, they can modify their questions and tags to check the different results of the tool and deliberately improve their questions to get accepted answers.","2643-7171","978-1-6654-1403-6","10.1109/ICPC52881.2021.00015","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9462981","empirical software engineering;coding problems;Stack Overflow","Tools;Predictive models;Programming;Search problems;Knowledge discovery;Software;Encoding","","14","","42","IEEE","28 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The game investigated in four different conditions what the effects were of different help levels to support knowledge transfer and different levels of game features to provide the players with a stimulating game experience. The performance of the participating players was measured in terms of precision and motivation. Precision reflects the quality of the work done and motivation is represented by the amount of work done by the players. The four game conditions varied in an implicit and an explicit level of help and poor and rich game features. The game condition with the explicit help function combined with the rich game experience showed significantly more motivation among the players than the game condition with the implicit help function combined with the poor gaming experience. Precision did not show any significant difference between the game conditions, but was high enough to generate Mars maps exposing aeolian processes, surface layering, river meanders and other concepts. Apparently the players were capable of acquiring deeper concepts about Mars's geology and the results were of such a high quality that they could be used as input for and to reinforce scientific research.","","978-1-4577-1452-8","10.1109/CGAMES.2011.6000339","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6000339","HiRISE;MRO;Mars;Crowdsourcing;Serious;Gaming;Semantics;Knowledge Transfer","Games;Mars;Computers;Knowledge transfer;NASA;Training;Semantics","","2","1","27","IEEE","25 Aug 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Using these snippets raises various maintenance and legal issues. The SO license requires attribution, i.e., referencing the original question or answer, and requires derived work to adopt a compatible license. While there is a heated debate on SO's license model for code snippets and the required attribution, little is known about the extent to which snippets are copied from SO without proper attribution. In this paper, we present the research design and summarized results of an empirical study analyzing attributed and unattributed usages of SO code snippets in GitHub projects. On average, 3.22% of all analyzed repositories and 7.33% of the popular ones contained a reference to SO. Further, we found that developers rather refer to the whole thread on SO than to a specific answer. For Java, at least two thirds of the copied snippets were not attributed.","","978-1-5386-1589-8","10.1109/ICSE-C.2017.99","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7965289","empirical study;code snippets;copy-and-paste programming;licensing;stack overflow;github;survey","Licenses;Java;Software;Law;Software engineering;Maintenance engineering","","19","","18","IEEE","24 Aug 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Thanks to public crowdsourcing platforms, e.g., Amazon Mechanical Turk and CrowdFlower, we can easily involve hundreds of thousands of ordinary workers (i.e., the crowd) to address these computer-hard tasks. However it is rather inconvenient to interact with the crowdsourcing platforms, because the platforms require one to set parameters and even write codes. Inspired by traditional DBMS, crowdsourcing database systems have been proposed and widely studied to encapsulate the complexities of interacting with the crowd. In this tutorial, we will survey and synthesize a wide spectrum of existing studies on crowdsourcing database systems. We first give an overview of crowdsourcing, and then summarize the fundamental techniques in designing crowdsourcing databases, including task design, truth inference, task assignment, answer reasoning and latency reduction.

This paper studies the strategies and prediction models for controlling crowdsourcing quality. By means of regression analysis, a trust model for the contractor to effectively complete the crowdsourcing task is constructed. According to the characteristic variables that influence the contractor to effectively complete the task, a random forests model is established to classify the contractor. In addition, the excellent integrated learning ability and generalization ability of the random forests are used to predict the crowdsourcing quality.

In this paper, we propose the Affective Crowdsourcing (AC) approach to fill this important gap. It is a distributed dynamic scheduling approach which minimizes crowdsourcing worker effort expenditure while achieving high collective productivity. Our approach leverages the emerging body of evidence about the relationship between people's mood and their productivity to operationalize the `productive laziness' concept from workforce management research. Extensive experimental studies based on a large-scale dataset released by Tianchi demonstrate that AC significantly conserves worker effort, while making the smallest sacrifice in terms of task completion rates as compared to other alternative scheduling approaches. The proposed approach is novel and establishes a framework for crowdsourcing workers to optimize their work and rest schedules.","","978-1-5386-0768-8","10.1109/AGENTS.2017.8015317","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8015317","","Crowdsourcing;Mood;Productivity;Throughput;Schedules;Linear programming;Optimization","","10","","32","IEEE","24 Aug 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Spatial crowdsourcing differs from traditional crowdsourcing in that tasks released by a requester are location-related, and workers should physically travel to a specific spot to perform the task. Task assignment is an important issue in spatial crowdsourcing. Most existing works adopt SAT (Server Assigned Tasks) assignment mode [1], where the SC-server assigns tasks to workers in regular timestamps. However, existing works [1], [2], [3] on this mode are based on the assumption that no rejection would happen after the assignment and workers guarantee to perform their assigned tasks. In practice, a rejection would happen when the worker is not interested in the assigned tasks, which may result from long travel distance, critical time requirement, dissatisfactory payment, workers' lacking skills and etc. In the typical application of spatial crowdsourcing, Uber, workers (drivers) are allowed to reject the ride requests assigned by the server. Uber requires its drivers to accept at least 90 percent of the trip requests in order to avoid low system throughput and poor experience for riders [4]. Taking workers' rejections into concern, in spatial crowdsourcing, how to match the workers with the right tasks to maximize their acceptance is of great importance. Without consideration of workers' acceptance, the system's throughput cannot be guaranteed.","2375-026X","978-1-5090-6543-1","10.1109/ICDE.2017.42","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7929938","","Crowdsourcing;Approximation methods;Servers;Time complexity;Throughput;Greedy algorithms;Conferences","","7","","5","IEEE","18 May 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However quality control still remains a challenge since spammers in crowdsourcing platforms may submit unreliable answers. To identify the spammer involved in crowdsourcing projects, this paper analyzes labelers' behavioral characteristics (e.g., response time) in the Baidu Crowdsourcing Platform (BCP). By doing so, we gain insight into the complex interactions between the labelers and the projects conducted in crowdsourcing platforms. Based on the above analysis results, a probabilistic model is furthermore constructed to obtain objective measures of labeler reliability. In particular, our approach attempts to combine the labeler behavioral characteristics to identify spammer. Furthermore, we develop a real-time anti-spamming system so as to identify spammers while projects are conducted in BCP. Finally, we implement comprehensive experiments to evaluate our approach on the real projects that have been published in BCP.

Through the comparison, consumers are able to find stores that sell items at lower prices, hence helping them to save on their household expenditures. The success of this mechanism strongly relies on the timeliness and comprehensiveness of the prices information. Due to the large number of stores available and the nature of items prices that keep changing from time to time, ensuring the timeliness and comprehensiveness of the information is very challenging. Mobile crowdsourcing was therefore identified as the most suitable method to be used in addressing the challenge, because in mobile crowdsourcing, the information will be contributed by the consumers through their mobile devices. Hence, the sources of information are unlimited, both temporally and spatially. A critical success factor of this mechanism, which also holds true in any crowdsourcing-based application, is the volume of participating crowd, in this case, the consumers. Without their participation, the objective of any crowdsourcing activities cannot be achieved. Therefore, in this paper, an adhesive architecture for mobile crowdsourcing is proposed, which took into consideration the elements that can help in attracting consistent participation from the crowd.","","978-4-9076-2612-9","10.1109/ICMU.2015.7061031","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7061031","","Crowdsourcing;Mobile communication;Computer architecture;Mobile handsets;Mobile computing;Portals;Business","","","","10","","16 Mar 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The study reported in this short (research-in-progress) paper shows how crowdsourcing can be used as a method for the collection of revealed preference data in the context of transport studies. In transport studies, data is traditionally collected through surveys, diaries or simulations. Here, crowdsourcing could provide an alternative method that provides real-life data very fast and very cheap to researchers. To generate insights on crowdsourcing as an alternative data collection method, we use an open call on a crowdsourcing platform (Amazon Mechanical Turk - AMT), a mobile application (Advanced Travel Logging Application for Smartphones II - ATLAS II) and a participant survey to practically perform such a crowdsourced data collection and evaluate the effectiveness of the method. While the full study is still in progress, the initial results reported in this paper are promising and support the idea that crowdsourcing can indeed be used as an effective method for the collection of revealed preference data.","","978-1-4799-8356-8","10.1109/SOSE.2015.52","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7133556","Crowdsourcing;Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT);Advanced Travel Logging Application for Smartphones II (ATLAS II);data collection;revealed preference data;transport studies","Crowdsourcing;Data collection;Transportation;Smart phones;Global Positioning System;Recruitment;Australia","","","","37","IEEE","25 Jun 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

On the other hand, automatic Question Answering (QA) systems are unable to comprehend questions including images and implementing necessary algorithms for such systems is expensive. In this paper, we propose QA process based on Crowd sourcing, which runs on a QA open system. The system benefits from Crowd sourcing advantages, besides automation techniques. The model is operational and we have demonstrated that questions could be received from different heterogeneous sources, if the suitable procedures are used, and that the answer is obtained from the crowd in the proposed process based on Crowd sourcing.

Nowadays, platforms like Twitter are used as real-time communication hub for sharing such information, like humans' on-site observations, advice and requests, and thus can serve as a network of “human sensors” for retrieving information on crisis situations. Recently, so-called crowd-sensing systems for crisis management have started to utilize these networks for harvesting crisis-related social media content. However, up to now these mainly support their human operators in the visual analysis of retrieved messages only and do not aim at the automated extraction and fusion of semantically-grounded descriptions of the underlying real-world crisis events from these textual contents, such as providing structured descriptions of the types and locations of reported damage. This hampers further computational situation assessment, such as providing overall description of the on-going crisis situation, its associated consequences and required response actions. Consequently, this lack of semantically-grounded situational context does not allow to fully implement situation-adaptive crowd knowledge extraction, meaning the system can utilize already established (crowd) knowledge to correspondingly adapt its crowd-sensing and knowledge extraction process alongside the monitored situation, to keep pace with the underlying real-world incidents. In the light of this, in the present paper, we illustrate the realization of a situation-adaptive crowd-sensing and knowledge extraction system by introducing our crowdSA prototype, and examine its potential in a case study on a real-world Twitter crisis data set.","2379-1675","978-1-5090-0632-8","10.1109/COGSIMA.2016.7497812","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7497812","","Data mining;Hurricanes;Twitter;Context;Media;Ontologies;Meteorology","","12","","25","IEEE","23 Jun 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Despite the popularity of Stack Overflow, its role in the work cycle of open-source developers is yet to be understood: on the one hand, participation in it has the potential to increase the knowledge of individual developers thus improving and speeding up the development process. On the other hand, participation in Stack Overflow may interrupt the regular working rhythm of the developer, hence also possibly slow down the development process. In this paper we investigate the interplay between Stack Overflow activities and the development process, reflected by code changes committed to the largest social coding repository, GitHub. Our study shows that active GitHub committers ask fewer questions and provide more answers than others. Moreover, we observe that active Stack Overflow askers distribute their work in a less uniform way than developers that do not ask questions. Finally, we show that despite the interruptions incurred, the Stack Overflow activity rate correlates with the code changing activity in GitHub.","","978-0-7695-5137-1","10.1109/SocialCom.2013.35","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6693332","software development;crowdsourced knowledge;social media","Software;Rhythm;Electronic mail;Indexes;Communities;Productivity;Merging","","161","","35","IEEE","2 Jan 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Most Q&A communities identify rollback edits by human review, which is not efficient and timely enough. To address this problem, we aim to construct a model that can automatically predict whether an edit should be rolled back. Considering that in addition to changing the content of a post, editing activities usually generate metadata information. Therefore, we first conduct an empirical study to investigate the metadata factors that may be associated with edit rollbacks. The analysis results indicate that metadata features from multiple dimensions have different levels of significant effects on edit rollback, and edit textual contents are dependent on metadata. Based on these results, we propose a deep learning model, namely DFMT (Deep Fusion of Metadata and Text), for rollback prediction. Experimental results on a real Stack Overflow dataset demonstrates the effectiveness of DFMT compared to several baselines.","","978-1-6654-0527-0","10.1109/CSCWD54268.2022.9776034","National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9776034","Rollback edits;Q&A Sites;Collaborative editing;Deep learning","Deep learning;Analytical models;Fuses;Conferences;Computational modeling;Collaboration;Metadata","","","","20","IEEE","20 May 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Existing work mainly focused on classifying questions into different major categories (e.g., ""Health"",""Computer"", etc.) without further dealing with the fine-grained categories (e.g., ""Dental"",""Skin Conditions"", etc.). Identifying questions' finegrained categories is challenging due to the limited length of a question and insufficient content information available in these social Q&A websites. In this work, we propose a novel framework to classify questions into fine-grained categories based on enriching the related topics of questions. We leverage word embedding feature representation with topic modelings to determine the extended feature terms, i.e., terms that do not appeared in original question content. The enriched features then are used for fine-grained category classification.

Users on Stack Overflow actively revise posted code snippets, sometimes addressing bugs and vulnerabilities. Accordingly, developers that reuse code from Stack Overflow should treat it like any other evolving code dependency and be vigilant about updates. It is unclear whether developers are doing so, to what extent outdated code snippets from Stack Overflow are present in GitHub projects, and whether developers miss security-relevant updates to reused snippets.To shed light on those questions, we devised a method to 1) detect outdated code snippets versions from 1.5M Stack Overflow snippets in 11,479 popular GitHub projects and 2) detect security-relevant updates to those Stack Overflow code snippets not reflected in those GitHub projects. Our results show that developers did not update dependent code snippets when those evolved on Stack Overflow. We found that 2,405 code snippet versions reused in 2,109 GitHub projects were outdated, with 43 projects missing fixes to bugs and vulnerabilities on Stack Overflow. Those 43 projects containing outdated, insecure snippets were forked on average 1,085 times (max. 16,121), indicating that our results are likely a lower bound for affected code bases. An important insight from our work is that treating Stack Overflow code as purely static code impedes holistic solutions to the problem of copying insecure code from Stack Overflow. Instead, our results suggest that developers need tools that continuously monitor Stack Overflow for security warnings and code fixes for reused code snippets and not only warn during copy-pasting.","2375-1207","979-8-3503-3130-1","10.1109/SP54263.2024.00022","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10646745","","Privacy;Codes;Computer bugs;Pipelines;Cloning;Security;Software measurement","","","","43","IEEE","5 Sep 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The effective reuse of libraries depends upon the quality of the API (Application Program Interface) documentation. Well established libraries typically have comprehensive API documentation, for example in Javadocs. However, they typically lack examples and explanations, which makes the effective reuse of the library difficult. StackOverflow.com (SO) is a Question and Answer service directed to issues related to software development. On SO, developers post questions related to a programming topic and other members of the SO community can provide answers to help them solving their problems. Despite the increasing adoption of SO, the information related to a particular topic is spread across the website. Thus, SO still lacks organization of its crowd knowledge. In this paper, we present an automatic approach that organizes the information available on SO in order to build cookbooks (recipe-oriented books) for APIs. The cookbooks are meant to be used through an exploration process (browsing). In order to evaluate the proposed approach, we have generated cookbooks for three APIs widely used by the software development community: SWT, STL and LINQ. Desired properties that cookbooks must meet were identified and a study was conducted to assess to what extent the generated cookbook meet those properties.","","978-1-4799-4223-7","10.1109/SBES.2014.15","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6943479","Q&A services;crowd knowledge;APIs documentation","Documentation;Software;Libraries;Communities;Message systems;Measurement;Equations","","12","","28","IEEE","3 Nov 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It conflicts with the main objective of crowdsourcing systems which is to promote mass collaboration. In this paper, we propose a situation-aware approach - SWORD - to enable existing reputation models to work in crowdsourcing systems. We holistically consider the objectives of all stake-holders in a crowdsourcing system (including requesters, workers, and system operators) to formulate the HIT allocation problem as a trade-off between quality and timeliness, and propose an efficient approach via constraint optimization to produce solutions to this problem with low computational complexity.

Right now, the crowdsourcing websites only use one of them and the satisfaction of the workers and the requesters is not fully addressed. Furthermore, it is not easy for the requesters to identify qualified workers quickly. In this paper, we propose a crowdsourcing model that considers the preferences of both the requesters and workers to improve their satisfaction and thereafter benefits the crowdsourcing platform. We first put forward a ranking formula for the requesters to identify qualified workers timely based on the Bayesian inference by considering two factors: the prices the workers charge and their online reviews, and then propose a stable task assignment algorithm STA that stably matches the workers and the tasks through the stable marriage approach. Simulation results show that our proposed task assignment approach greatly improves the satisfaction of the requesters and the workers compared with the existing Hungarian method and the STA variations that only consider one factor.","","978-1-7281-1664-8","10.1109/CSE/EUC.2019.00096","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8919596","Baysian inference, crowdsourcing, preference list, stable matching, task assignment","Task analysis;Crowdsourcing;Servers;Conferences;Organizations;Bayes methods","","5","","24","IEEE","5 Dec 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

"A Comparative Study on Annotation Quality of Crowdsourcing and LLm Via Label Aggregation","J.

Some works verified this issue with the average performance of individual crowd workers and LLM workers on some specific NLP tasks by collecting new datasets. However, on the one hand, existing datasets for the studies of annotation quality in crowdsourcing are not yet utilized in such evaluations, which potentially provide reliable evaluations from a different viewpoint. On the other hand, the quality of these aggregated labels is crucial because, when utilizing crowdsourcing, the estimated labels aggregated from multiple crowd labels to the same instances are the eventually collected labels. Therefore, in this paper, we first investigate which existing crowdsourcing datasets can be used for a comparative study and create a benchmark. We then compare the quality between individual crowd labels and LLM labels and make the evaluations on the aggregated labels. In addition, we propose a Crowd-LLM hybrid label aggregation method and verify the performance. We find that adding LLM labels from good LLMs to existing crowdsourcing datasets can enhance the quality of the aggregated labels of the datasets, which is also higher than the quality of LLM labels themselves.","2379-190X","979-8-3503-4485-1","10.1109/ICASSP48485.2024.10447803","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10447803","Crowdsourcing;Label Aggregation;Large Language Model","Crowdsourcing;Annotations;Quality control;Benchmark testing;Signal processing;Chatbots;Reliability","","4","","26","IEEE","18 Mar 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Our key observation is that: HD map data crowdsourcing exhibits the diminishing marginal utility thus there exists an inflection point for maximum utility, meanwhile its premature convergence of utility will leave some map updates not notified in time. Based on this observation, we develop a periodic crowdsourcing task distribution framework. It discretizes the demands for collecting source data into different periods and uses an optimal stopping rule to terminate the data collection for the maximum crowdsourcing utility. The experimental results verify that our crowdsourcing framework can achieve high time coverage and high efficiency with lower cost.","2642-7346","978-1-6654-0386-3","10.1109/RTAS52030.2021.00050","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9470447","crowdsourcing;edge computing;HD Map;autonomous driving","Crowdsourcing;Industries;Pain;Maintenance engineering;Data collection;Real-time systems;Task analysis","","4","","11","IEEE","7 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

When disputes occurred during the crowdsourcing process, the traditional method was to decide results by the centralized platform, which may lead to unfairness. We innovatively apply the quadratic voting to the crowdsourcing system. And for the sybil attack in the voting, the process of voting was improved.

Crowdsourcing enables a mobile app testing to be distributed as a crowdsourced task to leverage the crowd in a community. However, a high test quality and expected test context coverage are difficult to achieve in crowdsourcing test. Upon distributing a test task, mobile app providers can neither know who will participate and submit a high-qualified test report nor predict whether all expected test contexts can be covered during the test. To address this problem, we put forward a novel research problem called Coverage-constrained Quality Maximization (CQM) for crowdsourcing test. Given a mobile app test task, our objective is to discover and recommend a set of potential workers from available crowd workers such that they can accomplish the task achieving expected test context coverage and the possible highest test quality. We prove that the CQM problem is NP-Complete and then introduce two efficient greedy algorithms. Based on a real dataset of the largest Chinese crowdsourcing test platform, our evaluation shows that the proposed algorithms are effective and efficient, and can be potentially used as online services in practice.","","978-1-5386-1589-8","10.1109/ICSE-C.2017.112","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7965300","","Context;Crowdsourcing;Mobile communication;Testing;Software;Greedy algorithms;Conferences","","3","","11","IEEE","24 Aug 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Crowdsourcing is the process of gathering work, information, or opinions from a large number of individuals using the internet, social media, or smartphone apps. Whether crowdsourcing is used for programming, design, content creation, or any other task, requesters are putting their trust in individuals who are unfamiliar with their knowledge and have unknown histories and skills. Requesters do not have the time or resources to screen all of the crowd's qualities, unlike employing full-time personnel. In this study, we try to minimize the risks faced by requesters when using a crowdsourcing platform to complete their work, namely by increasing the match between the profile of workers and the jobs offered on the crowdsourcing platform. The researcher implemented the profile matching method using a dataset consisting of several fields that became the criteria for finding a match. The criteria used to find a match between workers and the work offered consist of two parts, core factors and secondary factors. Core Factor Criteria as skill, designation, location, and the secondary factor is the number of years of work experience. These criteria become variables that are used in the profile matching algorithm to find workers who best match the profiles offered. This algorithm is able to select worker profiles from 10,000 datasets, up to 1148 people who are most suitable for the tasks offered. And the results obtained indicate an increase in the match between workers and the needs of the work offered by the requester.","2770-4661","978-1-6654-5140-6","10.1109/ICOIACT55506.2022.9972155","Universiti Malaysia Pahang; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9972155","crowdsourcing;profile matching;worker","Crowdsourcing;Social networking (online);Programming;Information and communication technology;Personnel;History;Task analysis","","3","","23","IEEE","12 Dec 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
