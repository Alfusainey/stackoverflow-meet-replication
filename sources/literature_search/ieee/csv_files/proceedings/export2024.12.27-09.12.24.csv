In this paper, we present a novel database, RAF-DB, which contains about 30000 facial images from thousands of individuals. Each image has been individually labeled about 40 times, then EM algorithm was used to filter out unreliable labels. Crowdsourcing reveals that real-world faces often express compound emotions, or even mixture ones. For all we know, RAF-DB is the first database that contains compound expressions in the wild. Our cross-database study shows that the action units of basic emotions in RAF-DB are much more diverse than, or even deviate from, those of lab-controlled ones. To address this problem, we propose a new DLP-CNN (Deep Locality-Preserving CNN) method, which aims to enhance the discriminative power of deep features by preserving the locality closeness while maximizing the inter-class scatters. The benchmark experiments on the 7-class basic expressions and 11-class compound expressions, as well as the additional experiments on SFEW and CK+ databases, show that the proposed DLP-CNN outperforms the state-of-the-art handcrafted features and deep learning based methods for the expression recognition in the wild.","1063-6919","978-1-5386-0457-1","10.1109/CVPR.2017.277","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8099760","","Databases;Reliability;Compounds;Face recognition;Machine learning;Gold;Crowdsourcing","","724","","47","IEEE","9 Nov 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we introduce a reverse auction framework to model the interactions between the platform and the smartphones. We rigorously prove that optimally determining the winning bids is NP hard. In this paper we design a mechanism called TRAC which consists of two main components. The first component is a near-optimal approximate algorithm for determining the winning bids with polynomial-time computation complexity, which approximates the optimal solution within a factor of 1 + ln(n), where n is the maximum number of sensing tasks that a smartphone can accommodate. The second component is a critical payment scheme which, despite the approximation of determining winning bids, guarantees that submitted bids of smartphones reflect their real costs of performing sensing tasks. Through both rigid theoretical analysis and extensive simulations, we demonstrate that the proposed mechanism achieves truthfulness, individual rationality and high computation efficiency.","0743-166X","978-1-4799-3360-0","10.1109/INFOCOM.2014.6848055","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6848055","","Sensors;Mobile communication;Crowdsourcing;Algorithm design and analysis;Approximation methods;Approximation algorithms;Collaboration","","307","","24","IEEE","8 Jul 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Unlike previous attempts to secure GPS, Crowd-GPS-Sec neither requires any updates of the GPS infrastructure nor of the airborne GPS receivers, which are both unlikely to happen in the near future. In contrast, Crowd-GPS-Sec leverages crowdsourcing to monitor the air traffic from GPS-derived position advertisements that aircraft periodically broadcast for air traffic control purposes. Spoofing attacks are detected and localized by an independent infrastructure on the ground which continuously analyzes the contents and the times of arrival of these advertisements. We evaluate our system with real-world data from a crowdsourced air traffic monitoring sensor network and by simulations. We show that Crowd-GPS-Sec is able to globally detect GPS spoofing attacks in less than two seconds and to localize the attacker up to an accuracy of 150 meters after 15 minutes of monitoring time.","2375-1207","978-1-5386-4353-2","10.1109/SP.2018.00012","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8418651","GPS;ADS B;Spoofing Detection;Spoofer Localization;Localization Security","Global Positioning System;Aircraft;Receivers;Monitoring;Satellite broadcasting;Transponders;Atmospheric modeling","","79","1","52","IEEE","26 Jul 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper we propose a framework for assigning tasks to workers in an online manner without compromising the location privacy of workers and tasks. We perturb the locations of both tasks and workers based on geo-indistinguishability and then devise techniques to quantify the probability of reachability between a task and a worker, given their perturbed locations. We investigate both analytical and empirical models for quantifying the worker-task pair reachability and propose task assignment strategies that strike a balance among various metrics such as the number of completed tasks, worker travel distance and system overhead.

Further, we introduce a service quality concept to indicate the expected service gain that a requester can enjoy when he recruits an encountered worker, by jointly taking into account worker ability, real-timeness and task reward. Based on the models, we formulate an online worker recruitment problem to maximize the expected sum of service quality. We derive an optimal worker recruitment policy through the dynamic programming principle, and show that it exhibits a nice threshold based structure. We conduct extensive performance evaluation based on real traces, and numerical results demonstrate that our policy can achieve superior performance and improve more than 30% performance gain over classic policies.

Since these workers cannot be supervised, we propose methods for detecting and discarding inaccurate or malicious scores. To facilitate this process, we offer an open source set of tools for Amazon Mechanical Turk, which is an Internet marketplace for crowdsourcing.

Observations of chromosomal segments or translocations during metaphase can indicate structural changes in the cell genome, and is often used for diagnostic purposes. Karyotyping of the chromosomes micro-photographed under metaphase is done by characterizing the individual chromosomes in cell spread images. Currently, considerable effort and time is spent to manually segment out chromosomes from cell images, and classifying the segmented chromosomes into one of the 24 types, or for diseased cells to one of the known translocated types. Segmenting out the chromosomes in such images can be especially laborious and is often done manually, if there are overlapping chromosomes in the image which are not easily separable by image processing techniques. Many techniques have been proposed to automate the segmentation and classification of chromosomes from spread images with reasonable accuracy, but given the criticality of the domain, a human in the loop is often still required. In this paper, we present a method to segment out and classify chromosomes for healthy patients using a combination of crowdsourcing, preprocessing and deep learning, wherein the non-expert crowd from CrowdFlower is utilized to segment out the chromosomes from the cell image, which are then straightened and fed into a (hierarchical) deep neural network for classification. Experiments are performed on 400 real healthy patient images obtained from a hospital. Results are encouraging and promise to significantly reduce the cognitive burden of segmenting and karyotyping chromosomes.","2160-7516","978-1-5386-0733-6","10.1109/CVPRW.2017.109","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8014843","","Biological cells;Image segmentation;Crowdsourcing;Machine learning;Pipelines;Microscopy;Conferences","","60","3","18","IEEE","24 Aug 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"Mechanism Design for Crowdsourcing: An Optimal 1-1/e Competitive Budget-Feasible Mechanism for Large Markets","N. Anari; G. Goel; A.

In these markets, there is a requester who wants to hire workers to accomplish some tasks. Each worker is assumed to give some utility to the requester on getting hired. Moreover each worker has a minimum cost that he wants to get paid for getting hired. This minimum cost is assumed to be private information of the workers. The question then is -- if the requester has a limited budget, how to design a direct revelation mechanism that picks the right set of workers to hire in order to maximize the requester's utility? We note that although the previous work (Singer (2010) chen et al. (2011)) has studied this problem, a crucial difference in which we deviate from earlier work is the notion of large-scale markets that we introduce in our model. Without the large market assumption, it is known that no mechanism can achieve a competitive ratio better than 0.414 and 0.5 for deterministic and randomized mechanisms respectively (while the best known deterministic and randomized mechanisms achieve an approximation ratio of 0.292 and 0.33 respectively). In this paper, we design a budget-feasible mechanism for large markets that achieves a competitive ratio of 1 - 1/e ≃ 0.63. Our mechanism can be seen as a generalization of an alternate way to look at the proportional share mechanism, which is used in all the previous works so far on this problem. Interestingly, we can also show that our mechanism is optimal by showing that no truthful mechanism can achieve a factor better than 1 - 1/e, thus, fully resolving this setting. Finally we consider the more general case of submodular utility functions and give new and improved mechanisms for the case when the market is large.","0272-5428","978-1-4799-6517-5","10.1109/FOCS.2014.36","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6979011","Crowdsourcing;Truthful Mechanisms;Large Markets;Budget-feasibility","Approximation methods;Resource management;Crowdsourcing;Additives;Standards;Pricing;Polynomials","","50","","19","IEEE","11 Dec 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A key issue in SC is how best to assign tasks, e.g., the delivery of food and packages, to appropriate workers. Specifically, we study the problem of Fairness-aware Task Assignment (FTA) in SC, where tasks are to be assigned in a manner that achieves some notion of fairness across workers. In particular, we aim to minimize the payoff difference among workers while maximizing the average worker payoff. To solve the problem, we first generate so-called Valid Delivery Point Sets (VDPSs) for each worker according to an approach that exploits dynamic programming and distance- constrained pruning. Next, we show that FTA is NP-hard and proceed to propose two heuristic algorithms, a Fairness-aware Game-Theoretic (FGT) algorithm and an Improved Evolutionary Game-Theoretic (IEGT) algorithm. More specifically, we formulate FTA as a multi-player game. In this setting, the FGT approach represents a best-response method with sequential and asynchronous updates of workers' strategies, given by the VDPSs, that achieves a satisfying task assignment when a pure Nash equilibrium is reached. Next, the IEGT approach considers a setting with a large population of workers that repeatedly engage in strategic interactions. The IEGT approach exploits replicator dynamics that cause the whole population to evolve and choose better resources, i.e., VDPSs. Using the property of evolutionary equilibrium, a satisfying task assignment is obtained that corresponds to a stable state with similar payoffs among workers and good average worker payoff. Extensive experiments offer insight into the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed solutions.","2375-026X","978-1-7281-9184-3","10.1109/ICDE51399.2021.00030","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9458933","Task assignment;Spatial crowdsourcing;Fairness;Game theory","Crowdsourcing;Heuristic algorithms;Sociology;Games;Nash equilibrium;Dynamic programming;Proposals","","41","","31","IEEE","22 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The main reason is that, in comparison to traditional laboratory-based subjective quality testing, crowd-based QoE assessment over the Internet promises to be not only much more cost-effective (no lab facilities required, less cost per subject) but also much faster in terms of shorter campaign setup and turnaround times. However, the reliability of remote test subjects and consequently, the trustworthiness of study results is still an issue that prevents the widespread adoption of crowd-based QoE testing. Various ideas for improving user rating reliability and test efficiency have been proposed, with the majority of them relying on a posteriori analysis of results. However, such methods introduce a major lag that significantly affects efficiency of campaign execution.

One of the critical issues in SC is task assignment that allocates tasks to appropriate workers. In this paper, we propose a novel SC problem, namely Coalition-based Task Assignment (CTA), where the spatial tasks (e.g., house removals, furniture installation) may require more than one workers (forming a coalition) to cooperate in order to maximize the overall rewards of workers. To tackle the CTA problem, we design both greedy method and equilibrium-based method. In particular, the greedy method aims to form a set of worker coalitions greedily to perform the tasks, in which we introduce an acceptance possibility to find the high-value task assignments. In the equilibrium-based algorithm, workers form coalitions in sequence and update their strategy (i.e., selecting a best-response task) at their turn, in order to maximize their own utility (i.e., reward of the coalition they stay in) until Nash equilibrium is reached. Since the equilibrium point obtained by the best-response approach is not unique and optimal in terms of total rewards, we further propose a simulated annealing scheme to find a better Nash equilibrium. The extensive experiments demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed methods on both real and synthetic datasets.","2375-026X","978-1-7281-9184-3","10.1109/ICDE51399.2021.00028","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9458777","coalition;task assignment;spatial crowdsourcing","Crowdsourcing;Greedy algorithms;Design methodology;Conferences;Simulated annealing;Nash equilibrium;Approximation algorithms","","39","","34","IEEE","22 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, such applications often have resource constraints in terms of bandwidth, storage, and processing capability, which limit the number of photos that can be crowdsourced. Thus, it is a challenge to use the limited resources to crowdsource photos that best cover the target area. In this paper, we leverage various geographical and geometrical information about photos, called metadata, to address this challenge. Metadata includes the location, orientation, field of view, and range of a camera. Based on metadata, we define photo utility to measure how well a target area is covered by a set of photos. We propose various techniques to analyze such coverage and calculate photo utility accurately and efficiently. We also study the problem of selecting photos with the largest utility under a resource budget, and propose an efficient algorithm that achieves constant approximation ratio. With our design, the crowdsourcing server can select photos based on metadata instead of real images, and thus use the limited resources to crowdsource the most useful photos. Both simulation and experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our design.","","978-1-5090-5336-0","10.1109/INFOCOM.2017.8056963","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8056963","","Metadata;Cameras;Crowdsourcing;Bandwidth;Servers;Mobile handsets;Conferences","","35","","27","IEEE","5 Oct 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, few existing works have thoroughly explored the potential of AI in code generation and users’ attitudes toward AI-assisted coding tools. This knowledge gap leaves it unclear how AI is transforming software engineering and programming education. This paper presents a scalable crowdsourcing data-driven framework to investigate the code generation performance of generative large language models from diverse perspectives across multiple social media platforms. Specifically, we utilize ChatGPT, a popular generative large language model, as a representative example to reveal its insights and patterns in code generation. First, we propose a hybrid keyword word expansion method that integrates words suggested by topic modeling and expert knowledge to filter relevant social posts of interest on Twitter and Reddit. Then we collect 316K tweets and 3.2K Reddit posts about ChatGPT’s code generation, spanning from Dec. 1, 2022 to January 31, 2023. Our data analytics show that ChatGPT has been used in more than 10 programming languages, with Python and JavaScript being the two most popular, for a diverse range of tasks such as code debugging, interview preparation, and academic assignment solving. Surprisingly, our analysis shows that fear is the dominant emotion associated with ChatGPT’s code generation, overshadowing emotions of happiness, anger, surprise, and sadness. Furthermore, we construct a ChatGPT prompt and corresponding code dataset by analyzing the screen-shots of ChatGPT code generation shared on social media. This dataset enables us to evaluate the quality of the generated code, and we have released this dataset to the public. We believe the insights gained from our work will provide valuable guidance for future research on AI-powered code generation.","0730-3157","979-8-3503-2697-0","10.1109/COMPSAC57700.2023.00117","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10196869","ChatGPT;Coding Generation;Software Engineering;Large Language Models (LLMs);Generative Models;Social Media","Codes;Social networking (online);Debugging;Chatbots;Software;Task analysis;Interviews","","35","","31","IEEE","2 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, existing traffic information acquisition systems only obtain coarse-grained traffic information on a small number of roads but cannot acquire fine-grained traffic information on every road. To address this problem, in this paper we study the traffic speed estimation problem, which, given a budget K, identifies K roads (called seeds) where the real traffic speeds on these seeds can be obtained using crowdsourcing, and infers the speeds of other roads (called non-seed roads) based on the speeds of these seeds. This problem includes two sub-problems: (1) Speed Inference - How to accurately infer the speeds of the non-seed roads; (2) Seed Selection - How to effectively select high-quality seeds. It is rather challenging to estimate the traffic speed accurately, because the traffic changes dynamically and the changes are hard to be predicted as many possible factors can affect the traffic. To address these challenges, we propose effective algorithms to judiciously select high-quality seeds and devise inference models to infer the speeds of the non-seed roads. On the one hand, we observe that roads have correlations and correlated roads have similar traffic trend: the speeds of correlated roads rise or fall compared with their historical average speed simultaneously. We utilize this property and propose a two-step model to estimate the traffic speed. The first step adopts a graphical model to infer the traffic trend and the second step devises a hierarchical linear model to estimate the traffic speed based on the traffic trend. On the other hand, we formulate the seed selection problem, prove that it is NP-hard, and propose several greedy algorithms with approximation guarantees. Experimental results on two large real datasets show that our method outperforms baselines by 2 orders of magnitude in efficiency and 40% in estimation accuracy.","","978-1-5090-2020-1","10.1109/ICDE.2016.7498298","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7498298","","Roads;Correlation;Estimation;Market research;Hidden Markov models;Real-time systems;Crowdsourcing","","35","","26","IEEE","23 Jun 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The ubiquity of sensor-equipped mobile devices enables us to crowdsource user trajectories, out of which indoor digital maps can be automatically constructed at low costs. Similar to other crowdsourced data, the collected user trajectories are often noisy and of low fidelity, which poses a challenge to the accurate map construction. To alleviate this problem, we propose CIMLoc - a crowdsourcing indoor map construction system for localization. The system is evaluated with real-world trajectories collected from different mobile devices. We quantify the construction errors by computing the localization errors achieved with the constructed map and the real map. Experimental results reveal that CIMLoc is able to construct accurate maps that significantly improve localization results. We believe that CIMLoc provides an effective solution to the indoor localization problems where the indoor maps are unavailable.","","978-1-4799-2843-9","10.1109/ISSNIP.2014.6827640","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6827640","","Trajectory;Navigation;Mobile handsets;High definition video;Estimation;Gyroscopes","","31","","11","IEEE","9 Jun 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Then, being the optimal problem NP-hard, we propose a simple but efficient greedy heuristic task allocation algorithm. We also propose a simple “maximum a-posteriori“ decision rule. Finally, we test and compare different solutions, showing that system performance can greatly benefit from information about workers' reputation. Our main findings are that: i) even largely inaccurate estimates of workers' reputation can be effectively exploited in the task assignment to greatly improve system performance; ii) the performance of the maximum a-posteriori decision rule quickly degrades as worker reputation estimates become inaccurate; iii) when workers' reputation estimates are significantly inaccurate, the best performance can be obtained by combining our proposed task assignment algorithm with the LRA decision rule introduced in the literature.","0743-166X","978-1-4799-8381-0","10.1109/INFOCOM.2015.7218675","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7218675","","Resource management;Error probability;Reliability;Crowdsourcing;Mutual information;Optimization;Computers","","27","","17","IEEE","24 Aug 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, they neglect the fact that a user may only have expertise on some problems (in some domains), but not others. Neglecting this expertise diversity may cause two problems: low estimation accuracy in truth analysis and ineffective task allocation. To address these problems, we propose an Expertise-aware Truth Analysis and Task Allocation (ETA2) approach, which can effectively infer user expertise and then allocate tasks and estimate truth based on the inferred expertise. ETA2 relies on a novel semantic analysis method to identify the expertise domains of the tasks and user expertise, an expertise-aware truth analysis solution to estimate truth and learn user expertise, and an expertise-aware task allocation method to maximize the probability that tasks are allocated to users with the right expertise while ensuring the work load does not exceed the processing capability at each user.

A similar type of confidence can be obtained if a single Turker happened to agree with a computer vision estimate. We thus incrementally collect a variable number of worker annotations per image based on online estimates of confidence. This is done using a sequential estimation of risk over a probabilistic model that combines worker skill, image difficulty, and an incrementally trained computer vision model. We develop specialized models and algorithms for binary annotation, part keypoint annotation, and sets of bounding box annotations. We show that our method can reduce annotation time by a factor of 4-11 for binary filtering of websearch results, 2-4 for annotation of boxes of pedestrians in images, while in many cases also reducing annotation error.

We found that the state-of-the-art commercial copyright infringement detection systems, such as the ContentID from YouTube, did not solve this problem well: large amounts of copyright-infringing videos bypass the detector while many legal videos are taken down by mistake. In addressing the copyright infringement detection problem for live videos, we identify several critical challenges: i) live streams are generated in real-time and the original copyright content from the owner may not be accessible; ii) streamers are getting more and more sophisticated in bypassing the copyright detection system (e.g., by modifying the title, tweaking the presentation of the video); iii) similar video descriptions and visual contents make it difficult to distinguish between legal streams and copyright-infringing ones. In this paper, we develop a crowdsourcing-based copyright infringement detection (CCID) scheme to address the above challenges by exploring a rich set of valuable clues from live chat messages.

To address these challenges, we propose an incentive-based crowdsourced entity collection framework CrowdEC that encourages workers to provide more distinct items using an incentive strategy. CrowdEC has fundamental differences from existing crowdsourcing collection methods. One the one hand, CrowdEC proposes a worker model and evaluates a worker's quality based on cross validation and entity checking. CrowdEC devises a worker utility model that considers both worker's quality and entities' distinctness provided by workers. CrowdEC proposes a worker elimination method to block workers with a low utility, which solves the first challenge. On the other hand, CrowdEC proposes an incentive pricing technique that encourages each qualified (i.e., non-eliminated) worker to provide distinct entities rather than duplicates. CrowdEC provides two types of tasks and judiciously assigns workers with appropriate tasks to address the second challenge. We have conducted both real and simulated experiments, and the results show that CrowdEC outperforms existing state-of-the-art works on both cost and quality.","2375-026X","978-1-5386-5520-7","10.1109/ICDE.2018.00039","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8509260","Crowdsourcing;entity collection","Task analysis;Crowdsourcing;Estimation;Pricing;Quality control;Fans;Knowledge based systems","","19","","30","IEEE","25 Oct 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These predictive models are made possible by employing a novel data collection process, coined as Subconscious Crowdsourcing, which helps to collect a faster and more reliable dataset of patients.

Given also the limitations of existing verifiable computing techniques, we propose a crowdsourcing idea from the game theoretic perspective to resolve the tension. We design a simple incentive mechanism so that the execution of a wide range of complex programs can be crowdsourced via the blockchain, and any false computing result could be deterred. In particular, our protocol works in the scenarios that there is no trusted third-party involved; Moreover, our protocol not only works in the classical model of non-colluding service providers, but also can tolerate any potential coalition up to n-1, where n is the total number of service providers. We also showcase how to use our protocol to crowdsource two typical kinds of machine learning tasks via open blockchain. We envision that our solution is not only promising to launch decentralized applications involving a wide range of machine learning programs, but also a stepping stone towards a general way to empowering intensive and randomized computations atop the open blockchain.","2375-9259","978-1-5386-9288-2","10.1109/ICDMW.2018.00019","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8637413","smart contract;blockchain;machine learning;crowdsourcing;game theory","Smart contracts;Blockchain;Machine learning;Task analysis;Games;Cryptography","","18","","20","IEEE","10 Feb 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the assignment of tasks that satisfy all group members in an even way remains a challenge. To this end, we propose a novel preference-aware group task assignment framework that includes two components: Mutual Information-based Preference Modeling (MIPM) and Preference-aware Group Task Assignment (PGTA). Specifically, MIPM learns the preferences of worker groups by maximizing the mutual information among workers based on the worker-task interaction data and the group-task interaction data, where an attention mechanism is used. PGTA adopts an optimal task assignment algorithm based on tree decomposition to assign tasks to appropriate worker groups, which aims to maximize the overall number of assigned tasks while giving priority to the groups of workers that are more interested in the tasks. Finally, extensive experiments are conducted, verifying the effectiveness and practicality of the proposed solutions.","2374-8486","978-1-6654-2398-4","10.1109/ICDM51629.2021.00046","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9679056","preference;group task assignment;mutual information;spatial crowdsourcing","Crowdsourcing;Wireless networks;Conferences;Data models;Data mining;Task analysis;Smart devices","","17","","36","IEEE","24 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In many cities, the local governments build thousands of fixed stations for PBS to alleviate the city traffic jam and solve the last-mile problem. However, the increasing use of PBSs leads to new congestion problems in the form that users have, such as no bike to rent or no dock to return the bike. Further, users wish to receive assistance on deciding how to select bike trips with minimal time cost while taking congestion into account. Meanwhile, crowdsourcing attracted increasing attention in recent years. This paper applies it to help users share information and select bike trips before the bikes or docks are occupied. An interesting and important problem is how to help users select bike trips so that the time consumed on the trips can be minimized. We model the problem as a Bike Trip Selection (BTS) game which is shown to be equivalent to the symmetric network congestion game. This equivalence allows us to design a BTS algorithm by which the users can find at least one Nash Equilibria (NE) distributively. Furthermore, this paper evaluates the algorithm based on real datasets collected from the PBS of Hangzhou City in China. We also design a BTS system including an Android APP and a server to conduct the experiment for the distributed BTS algorithm in practice.","","978-1-5386-4128-6","10.1109/INFOCOM.2018.8486277","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8486277","Bike Trip Selection;Public Bike System;Crowd-sourcing;Game Theory","Games;Urban areas;Crowdsourcing;Servers;Cost function;Androids;Humanoid robots","","16","","33","IEEE","11 Oct 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

One emerging solution is to crowdsource such undersampled sensor data from multiple vehicles to increase the detection accuracy. Aggregating sensor data from multiple vehicles, nonetheless, is a challenging task given the heterogeneity among vehicles, asynchronous sensor operation, GPS error, and sensor noise. Additionally, there may be bandwidth restrictions in vehicular networks which limit the amount of data available for aggregation. We investigate these issues by focusing on the problem of pothole detection. To quantify the detection accuracies and effects of real-world limitations, we design and evaluate three crowdsourcing pothole detection schemes involving vehicles and the Cloud. We also address the issue of lack of extensive model training data by demonstrating that a detection model applicable to real-world systems can be derived using simulated data.

People are drawn by interesting images and ignore tasteless ones. Image interestingness has the importance no less than other subjective image properties that have received significant research interest, but has not been systematically studied before. In this work we focus on visual and social aspects of image interestingness. We rely on crowdsourcing tools to survey human perceptions for these subjective properties and verify data by analyzing consistency and reliability. We show that people have an agreement when deciding if an image is interesting or not. We examine the correlation between the social, visual aspects of interestingness and aesthetics. By exploring the correlation, we find that: (1) Weak correlation between social interestingness and both of visual interestingness and image aesthetics indicates that the images frequently re-shared by people are not necessarily aesthetic or visually interesting. (2) High correlation between image aesthetics and visual interestingness implies aesthetic images are more likely to be visually interesting to people. Then we wonder what features of an image lead to social interestingness, e.g. receiving more likes and shares on social networking sites? We train classifiers to predict visual and social interestingness and investigate the contribution from different image features. We find that social and visual interestingness can be best predicted with color and texture, respectively, providing a way to manipulate social and visual liking of images with image features. Further, we investigate the correlation between social/visual image interestingness and image color. We find that colors with arousal effect show more frequently in images with higher social interestingness. That could be explained by previous studies for activation-related affect of colors and provides useful and important advice when advertising on social networking sites.","2379-190X","978-1-4799-2893-4","10.1109/ICASSP.2014.6854415","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6854415","Social image interestingness;visual image interestingness;aesthetics","Visualization;Correlation;Image color analysis;Crowdsourcing;Reliability;Social network services;Advertising","","15","","12","IEEE","14 Jul 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These platforms seek to incentivize heterogeneous workers to exert efforts to complete tasks (e.g., moderation of posts and articles) and truthfully report their solutions. Output agreement mechanism (e.g., majority voting) is a common approach to this end. In an output agreement mechanism, a worker is rewarded according to whether his solution matches those of his peers. However, prior related work has not studied the workers' heterogeneous solution accuracy and how this heterogeneity affects the platform's payoff. We fill this void by modeling and analyzing the interactions between the platform and workers as a two-stage Stackelberg game. In Stage I, the platform chooses the reward level for the majority voting to maximize its payoff. In Stage II, the workers decide their effort levels and reporting strategies to maximize their payoffs. We show that as a worker's solution accuracy increases, he is more likely to exert effort and truthfully report his solution under the equilibrium reward mechanism. However, given a fixed total worker population, it is surprising that the platform's overall payoff does not monotonically increase in the number of high-accuracy workers. This is because a larger number of high-accuracy workers brings marginally decreasing benefit to the platform, but the rewards required to incentivize them may significantly grow. Moreover, we show that as the solutions of the high-accuracy workers become more accurate, the platform needs a smaller number of such workers to achieve the maximum payoff.","2576-6813","978-1-7281-0962-6","10.1109/GLOBECOM38437.2019.9013519","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9013519","","Games;Crowdsourcing;Nash equilibrium;Social networking (online);User experience","","15","","10","IEEE","27 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, because of the exponential increase of IoT networks and their diversified devices (e.g., multiple brands, different communication channels, etc.), recruiting the appropriate devices/workers is becoming a challenging task. To this end, in this paper, we develop a recruitment process for SMCS platforms using automated SIoT service discovery to select trustworthy workers satisfying the requester requirements. The method we purpose includes mainly two stages: 1) a worker filtering stage, aiming at reducing the workers' search space to a subset of potential trustworthy candidates using the Louvain community detection algorithm (CD) applied to SIoT relation graphs. Next, 2) a selection process stage that uses an Integer Linear Program (ILP) to determine the final set of selected devices/workers. The ILP maximizes a worker efficiency metric incorporating the skills/specs level, recruitment cost, and trustworthiness level of the recruited IoT devices. Selected experiments analyze the performance of the proposed CD-ILP algorithm using a real-world dataset and show its superiority in providing an effective recruitment strategy compared to an existing stochastic algorithm.","","978-1-7281-4224-1","10.1109/TEMSCON47658.2020.9140085","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9140085","Social internet of things;mobile crowdsourcing;community detection;optimization","Task analysis;Recruitment;Sensors;Crowdsourcing;Research and development management;Conferences;Detection algorithms","","14","","19","IEEE","15 Jul 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we present an autonomous place naming system using opportunistic crowdsensing and knowledge from crowdsourcing. Our goal is to provide a place name from a person's perspective: that is, functional name (e.g., food place, shopping place), business name (e.g., Starbucks, Apple Store), or personal name (e.g., my home, my workplace). The main idea is to bridge the gap between crowdsensing data from smartphone users and location information in social network services. The proposed system automatically extracts a wide range of semantic features about the places from both crowdsensing data and social networks to model a place name. We then infer the place name by linking the crowdsensing data with knowledge in social networks. Extensive evaluations with real deployments show that the proposed system outperforms the related approaches and greatly reduces user intervention for place naming.","","978-1-4503-1959-1","10.1145/2461381.2461388","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6917585","Location-based Services;Location Naming;Smartphone Sensing","Feature extraction;Social network services;Sensors;Business;Educational institutions;Data mining;History","","14","5","28","","9 Oct 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

One of the biggest challenges of this type of problem is how to meaningfully integrate heterogeneous data to considerably improve the generality and quality of the learning model. In this paper, we first present a unified learning framework that aims to leverage the structural information from two types of data heterogeneity: view heterogeneity (as in multi-view learning) and worker heterogeneity (as in crowdsourcing). The objective follows the principles of view consistency and worker consensus by minimizing the loss term with a regularized prediction tensor. We then propose to relax and solve the optimization framework with an iterative updating method. We also prove that the gradient of the most time-consuming updating block is separable with respect to the workers, which leads to a randomized algorithm with faster speed and better convergence.

In this paper, we evaluate the extent to which a malicious server in a crowdsourcing air quality monitoring service can track the locations of users that contribute to the service. The participants periodically send information, such as temperature, relative humidity, carbon monoxide, and luminosity of their surrounding, using an off-the-shelf sensor connected to their mobile phones. The participants also send their coarse-grain location (i.e., disclosing the ID of the cell tower to which their mobile is coupled) along with the air quality data. We evaluate the precision with which the attacker can track the participants using only air quality data and location of the cell tower. We perform a thorough analysis of the privacy attack and show that it can accurately discover the destination of the users with a precision of more than 85% (up to 97%), if at least five consecutive samples are provided by the participants. We also discovered that the precision drops when the environmental sensors are affected by outside conditions (e.g., exposition to direct sunlight) but remains significant (54.5% for 20 consecutive samples).","","978-1-4673-7952-6","10.1109/Trustcom.2015.415","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7345323","user privacy;traceability;participatory sensing;air quality","Air quality;Temperature sensors;Monitoring;Data privacy;Privacy;Mobile communication","","12","","21","IEEE","3 Dec 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Because the monitoring map is updated in each time slot, we try to maximize the time-averaged data utility under the time-averaged budget constraint. This problem is particularly challenging given the unknown future information and the difficulty of solving the one-slot problem: maximizing a non-monotone submodular objective under the budget constraint. To address these challenges, we first make use of Lyapunov optimization to decompose the long-term optimization problem into a series of real-time problems which do not require a priori knowledge about the future information. We then propose a time-efficient online algorithm to solve the NP-hard one-slot problem. As long as the algorithm for the one-slot problem has a competitive ratio e, the time-averaged data utility of our online algorithm has a small gap compared with e times the optimal one.

One of the major issues is how to best assign tasks to workers. Given a worker and a task, the worker will choose to accept the task based on her affinity towards the task, and the worker can propagate the information of the task to attract more workers to perform it. These factors can be measured as worker-task influence. Since workers' affinities towards tasks are different and task issuers may ask workers who performed tasks to propagate the information of tasks to attract more workers to perform them, it is important to analyze worker-task influence when making assignments. We propose and solve a novel influence-aware task assignment problem in SC, where tasks are assigned to workers in a manner that achieves high worker-task influence. In particular, we aim to maximize the number of assigned tasks and worker-task influence. To solve the problem, we first determine workers' affinities towards tasks by identifying workers' historical task-performing patterns. Next, a Historical Acceptance approach is developed to measure workers' willingness of performing a task, i.e., the probability of workers visiting the location of the task when they are informed. Next, we propose a Random reverse reachable-based Propagation Optimization algorithm that exploits reverse reachable sets to calculate the probability of workers being informed about tasks in a social network. Based on worker-task influence derived from the above three factors, we propose three influence-aware task assignment algorithms that aim to maximize the number of assigned tasks and worker-task influence.

This may generate out-of-service events due to bike underflow or overflow, at a bike station. In this paper, we recruit workers through crowdsourcing to rebalance loads among bike stations. We assume that workers have their individual sources and destinations, and assign them to move bikes from overflow stations to underflow stations. We partition the complex spatial and temporal problem into a sequence of slices with a fixed duration in the temporal domain. In each slice, we focus on the spatial domain and allocate a pair of overflow/underflow stations to a worker such that the summation of detour cost among workers is minimized. The hardness of finding the min-cost allocation is shown by a reduction from a 3-dimensional matching problem (i.e., matching among workers, overflow stations, and underflow stations). We propose a 3-approximation algorithm for the problem when the detour cost is proportional to the detour distances. Then, the configuration dynamic in the sequence of slices is captured by carefully determining the rebalancing frequency and target for each rebalancing operation. We investigate heuristic approaches to decide rebalancing frequencies and targets over a sequence of slices in order to minimize the total number of bike movements (i.e., the total number of workers), and hence to derive the average total detours per slice. We simulate our algorithms on both real-world and synthetic datasets based on different time-slice granularities.

Such false contributions induce loss of revenue through disbursement of undue incentives and also negatively affects the application's operational reliability. In this work, we propose a reputation model, called QnQ, to segregate different user classes such as honest, selfish, or malicious based on their reputation scores. The resultant score is then used as an indicator to decide an incentive for a user. Unlike existing works, QnQ ensures fairness to different user behaviors by unifying `quantity' (degree of participation) and `quality' (accuracy of contribution). Specifically, QnQ utilizes evidences from a rating feedback mechanism to propose an event-specific expected truthfulness metric by considering total feedback volume, probability mass for positive evidence, and the discounted probability mass of uncertain evidence. To classify an event as true or not, a generalized linear model is used to transform its truthfulness into quality of information (QoI). Finally, the QoIs of various events in which a user participates, are aggregated to compute a user's reputation score. For evaluation of QnQ through experimental study, we consider a vehicular crowdsourcing application. QoI performance of our model is compared with Josang's belief model, while reputation and incentive leakage is compared with Dempster-Shafer based reputation model. Experimental results demonstrate that QnQ is able to better capture subtle differences in user behaviors by unifying both quality and quantity, and significantly reduces undue incentives in presence of rogue contributions.","","978-1-5386-0683-4","10.1109/CNS.2017.8228635","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8228635","Participatory sensing;Trust;Reputation;Secure Crowd sourcing;Security Economics;Vehicular Crowd Sensing","Uncertainty;Computational modeling;Sensors;Mathematical model;Security;Mobile communication;Crowdsourcing","","9","","23","IEEE","21 Dec 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Received signal strength (RSS)-based fingerprinting localization method may be the simplest and most efficient one. The radio map construction is time-consuming and labor-sensitive, hindering the wide use of RSS-based fingerprinting localization. Therefore, we propose a method of radio map construction based on crowdsourcing and interpolation for Wi-Fi indoor positioning system. First of all, fingerprints at a small number of refer points are collected by multiple smartphones. All missing RSS values are replaced by a constant. To alleviate the effect of device heterogeneity, the normalization method is introduced to both offline and online stage. Initial radio map is built after the process of normalization. Then, interpolated radio map can be generated by inverse distance weighted method. Subsequently, the initial and interpolated radio map are combined into a new one.

Current approaches to task assignment have primarily focused on content-based approaches, qualifications, or work history. We propose an alternative and complementary approach that focuses on what capabilities workers employ to perform tasks. First, we model various tasks according to the human capabilities required to perform them. Second, we capture the capability traces of the crowd workers performance on existing tasks. Third, we predict performance of workers on new tasks to make task routing decisions, with the help of capability traces. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach on three different tasks including fact verification, image comparison, and information extraction. The results demonstrate that we can predict worker's performance based on worker capabilities.

Currently, the existing works on privacy-preserving task allocation cannot simultaneously achieve strong privacy protection and dynamic update. Aiming at this challenge, we propose a privacy-preserving outsourced task scheduling scheme, in which the cloud servers can obliviously conduct task scheduling and update the workers' information based on the scheduling results. To this end, we design three secure protocols under a two-server model, which can protect the protocols' input and output against the cloud servers. The security analysis demonstrates that our proposed scheme can achieve strong privacy protection, and the experimental results indicate the scheme's efficiency in computing and communication.","2576-6813","978-1-6654-3540-6","10.1109/GLOBECOM48099.2022.10000758","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10000758","","Crowdsourcing;Privacy;Protocols;Processor scheduling;Servers;Security;Resource management","","9","","6","IEEE","11 Jan 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Previous works conduct the personalized recommendation of tasks to workers via supervised learning methods. However, the majority of them only consider the benefit of either workers or requesters independently. In addition, they do not consider the real dynamic environments (e.g., dynamic tasks, dynamic workers), so they may produce sub-optimal results. To address these issues, we utilize Deep Q-Network (DQN), an RL-based method combined with a neural network to estimate the expected long-term return of recommending a task. DQN inherently considers the immediate and the future rewards and can be updated quickly to deal with evolving data and dynamic changes. Furthermore, we design two DQNs that capture the benefit of both workers and requesters and maximize the profit of the platform. To learn value functions in DQN effectively, we also propose novel state representations, carefully design the computation of Q values, and predict transition probabilities and future states. Experiments on synthetic and real datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our framework.","2375-026X","978-1-7281-2903-7","10.1109/ICDE48307.2020.00012","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9101357","crowdsourcing platform;task arrangement;reinforcement learning;deep Q-Network","Task analysis;Crowdsourcing;Machine learning;Supervised learning;Learning (artificial intelligence);Neural networks;Labeling","","9","","38","IEEE","27 May 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Unfortunately, recent literature reviews show that in comparison to algorithmic performance evaluations, the number of user evaluations is still very low. Reasons for this are the required amount of time to conduct such studies together with the difficulties involved in participant recruitment and result reporting. While it could be shown that the quality of evaluation results and the simplified participant recruitment of crowdsourcing platforms makes this technology a viable alternative to lab experiments when evaluating visualizations, the time for conducting and reporting such evaluations is still very high. In this paper, we propose a software system, which integrates the conduction, the analysis and the reporting of crowdsourced user evaluations directly into the scientific visualization development process. With the proposed system, researchers can conduct and analyze quantitative evaluations on a large scale through an evaluation-centric user interface with only a few mouse clicks. Thus, it becomes possible to perform iterative evaluations during algorithm design, which potentially leads to better results, as compared to the time consuming user evaluations traditionally conducted at the end of the design process. Furthermore, the system is built around a centralized database, which supports an easy reuse of old evaluation designs and the reproduction of old evaluations with new or additional stimuli, which are both driving challenges in scientific visualization research. We will describe the system's design and the considerations made during the design process, and demonstrate the system by conducting three user evaluations, all of which have been published before in the visualization literature.","2165-8773","978-1-5090-1451-4","10.1109/PACIFICVIS.2016.7465249","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7465249","H.3.4.1 [Information Systems]: Systems and Software — Performance evaluation (efficiency and effectiveness);I.3.7 [Computer Graphics]: Three-Dimensional Graphics and Realism — Color;shading;shadowing;texture","Data visualization;Crowdsourcing;Visualization;Algorithm design and analysis;Recruitment;Prediction algorithms;Electronic mail","","8","","48","IEEE","5 May 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Hence, task requesters may be investing significantly in work that is inaccurate or even misleading. In this paper, we design a dynamic contract to incentivize high-quality work. Our proposed approach offers a theoretically proven algorithm to calculate the contract for each worker in a cost-efficient manner. In contrast to existing work, our contract design is not only adaptive to changes in workers' behavior, but also adjusts pricing policy in the presence of malicious behavior. Both theoretical and experimental analysis over real Amazon review traces show that our contract design can achieve a near optimal solution.

Specifically, the platform knows more information regarding workers' average solution accuracy, and can strategically reveal such information to workers. Workers will utilize the announced information to determine the likelihood that they obtain a reward if exerting effort on the task. We study two types of workers: (1) naive workers who fully trust the announcement, and (2) strategic workers who update prior belief based on the announcement. For naive workers, we show that the platform should always announce a high average accuracy to maximize its payoff. However, this is not always optimal for strategic workers, as it may reduce the credibility of the platform's announcement and hence reduce the platform's payoff. Interestingly, the platform may have an incentive to even announce an average accuracy lower than the actual value when facing strategic workers. Another counter-intuitive result is that the platform's payoff may decrease in the number of high-accuracy workers.","2641-9874","978-1-6654-0325-2","10.1109/INFOCOM42981.2021.9488853","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9488853","","Crowdsourcing;Conferences;Task analysis;Artificial intelligence;Robots","","8","","40","IEEE","26 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This contamination of public space is called visual pollution. The first step in the fight against visual pollution is localization of physical advertising media (e.g., billboards) as accurately as is possible. One of the ways is to use volunteer effort through outdoor crowdsourcing. Smart mobile devices can support this process through localization sensors. However, these sensors are inaccurate enough on their own, plus, the media are not located exactly where the volunteers capture them. Therefore, the media localization is presently inaccurate. This paper presents a work-in-progress method to improve the localization of physical advertisement media. As input, the method takes captured media images along with spatial information about the device. The images are then clustered based on their locations, to form sets corresponding to the true physical media. Then, using visual analysis of the images and spatial orientation of devices, the method computes expected location of the physical media.","","978-1-5386-0756-5","10.1109/SMAP.2017.8022662","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8022662","","Media;Advertising;Visualization;Pollution;Crowdsourcing;Image edge detection;Computer vision","","7","","9","IEEE","31 Aug 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Current solutions for protecting locations of workers assume that a trusted cellular service provider (CSP) knows the identities and locations of workers and sanitizes locations before sharing them with the SC server. In practice, the CSP may not have the technical ability, nor the proper incentives to perform the sanitization task. Thus, location protection must be performed by a Location Privacy Provider (LPP). To prevent identity disclosure to the LPP, we propose a novel solution based on anonymous credentials which preserves worker privacy.

To achieve this, one way is to gather spectrum data via wide-area sensor deployment and construct better Radio Environment Maps (REMs) with spatial models such as Kriging and Gaussian Process (GP). An economically viable alternative is via incentivized crowdsourcing, i.e., outsourcing sensing tasks to mobile users who have sensorized high-end client devices like tablets or smartphones, and providing proper incentives to compensate for users' sensing costs. In crowdsourced REM, features that impact REM performance and economic cost include user locations and the heterogeneity of user devices, which impact data quality and sensing costs. In this work, we emphasize the use of a hardware noise term in the GP model to account for data quality, and adopt mutual information to quantify sampling performance; we further design a pricing mechanism that allows the platform to maximize its expected utility at each stage and send optimal price offers to users sequentially, with joint consideration of sampling value, data quality and cost. We conduct simulations to evaluate the performance. Simulation results show that our mechanism outperforms two baseline mechanisms, and benefits from more users and less hardware noise (i.e., better data quality).","","978-1-5090-1328-9","10.1109/GLOCOM.2016.7842167","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7842167","","Sensors;Hardware;Data models;Pricing;Crowdsourcing;Biological system modeling;Noise measurement","","7","","14","IEEE","6 Feb 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Some complex tasks require the collaboration of multiple workers to ensure its successful completion. In this context, the task requester needs to hire a group of socially connected and collaborative workers that, at the same time, have sufficient skills to accomplish the task. In this paper, we develop two recruitment strategies for collaborative MCS frameworks in which, virtual teams are formed according to four different criteria: level of expertise, social relationship strength, recruitment cost, and recruiter's confidence level. The first proposed strategy is a platform-based approach which exploits the platform knowledge to form the team. The second one is a leader-based approach that uses team members' knowledge about their social network (SN) neighbors to designate a group leader that recruits its suitable team. Both approaches are modeled as integer linear programs resulting in optimal team formation. Experimental results show a performance trade-off between the two virtual team grouping strategies when varying the members SN edge degree. Compared to the leader-based strategy, the platform-based strategy recruits a more skilled team but with lower SN relationships and higher cost.","","978-1-7281-4224-1","10.1109/TEMSCON47658.2020.9140078","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9140078","Social network collaboration;mobile crowdsourcing systems;IoT;groupware;virtual team formation","Task analysis;Recruitment;Sensors;Crowdsourcing;Smart phones;Virtual groups","","7","","16","IEEE","15 Jul 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we introduce a novel real-time crowdsourcing incentive solution that rewards mobile users who contribute their qualified spectrum sensing data to a radio environment map. First, we develop a feature-based model based on advanced machine learning techniques in order to estimate model parameters of the radio environment map. Based on the prediction model, we then propose a smart dynamic pricing strategy including prepaid and postpaid pricing schemes. The prepaid scheme is to guarantee the minimum payment for participants, and the postpaid scheme is to reward the participants according to their contributions. Importantly, in our model, the postpaid scheme will be adjusted iteratively in a real-time manner based on the contributions of participants to the spectrum map.

Meanwhile, the real-time location information of automobiles is increasing and can be accessed easily thanks to the popularity of smartphone and smart vehicular devices. In this paper, we propose a new idea of guiding automobiles to proper parking lots by using the data collected from the vehicular Global Positioning System (GPS) device. Then we build a spatial-temporal classifier based on convolutional neural network (CNN) with long-short term memory (LSTM) to learn the parking experience from the automobiles uploading the parking locations. Finally, we use the classifier to recommend the proper parking lots nearby to vehicles, considering the related driving context. The experiment shows the proposed method can guide automobiles to the target parking lots accurately even if we do not know the real-time data of the target parking lots. Moreover, the classifier shows the obvious spatial characteristics and preference for the first time when guiding vehicles. This method is a kind of crowdsourcing and encourages automobiles to share their parking experience, to help park easier for themselves eventually. So, we think the method, crowd-parking, is very novel and competitive in the current state of endless business and technique negotiation among parking lots.","2577-1647","978-1-7281-4878-6","10.1109/IECON.2019.8927134","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8927134","City-wide parking guidance systems;location crowdsourcing;CNN- LSTM;spatial-temporal classifier","Global Positioning System;Crowdsourcing;Automobiles;Real-time systems;Urban areas;Business;Sensors","","7","","18","IEEE","9 Dec 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The system consists of three mobile crowdsourcing applications that allow the public, doctors and pharmacies to report diseases and drugs sales in real time. Data regarding diseases for the year 2017 were retrieved and the corresponding daily weather information namely as temperature, humidity and wind for that year was then extracted and added to this dataset. An Artificial Neural Network (ANN) was then trained with this dataset and then used to predict the propagation of the diseases which can be monitored by the Ministry of Health and Quality of Life through another application. The prediction was performed based on the number of reported diseases on the current day along with weather forecasts for the forthcoming days and the results were promising.

However, the quality of data services (QoDS) on human face datasets is usually biased towards the majority demographic group due to the data imbalance issue. In this paper, we focus on a fair human face dataset sampling problem where the goal is to sample a sub-dataset from the original dataset to reduce its bias by leveraging crowd intelligence to infer the demographic labels of face images (e.g., male or female, old or young). Our problem is motivated by the limitations of current fair data sampling solutions that require pre-annotated demographic labels to sample a fair dataset. Two important challenges exist in solving our problem: 1) it is extremely time-consuming and expensive to assign crowd workers to annotate demographic labels of all images in a large-scale facial dataset; 2) it is not a trivial task to improve the fairness of the sampled sub-dataset (with fewer data samples) without sacrificing the accuracy performance of data services on such dataset. To address the above challenges, we develop FairCrowd, a fair crowdsourcing-based data sampling framework that leverages an efficient batch-level demographic label inference model and a joint fair-accuracy-aware data shuffling method. We evaluate the performance of FairCrowd through a large-scale real-world face image dataset that consists of celebrity faces from a diversified set of demographic groups. The results show that FairCrowd not only reduces demographic bias but also improves the accuracy of data services trained on the sub-dataset generated by FairCrowd, leading to a more desirable QoDS of the application.","1548-615X","978-1-6654-1494-4","10.1109/IWQOS52092.2021.9521312","National Science Foundation; Army Research Office; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9521312","Fair Dataset Sampling;Machine Learning for Quality of Service;Quality of Data Service;Crowdsourcing","Crowdsourcing;Visualization;Face recognition;Quality of service;Data models;Task analysis;Faces","","6","","42","IEEE","26 Aug 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Two indices of Average Smiling Index (ASI) and Happiness Index (HI) are defined from different perspectives to describe the degree of human happiness in a specific region.

Using the situated shop location of users, the accuracy of the message and advertisement delivery can be effectively promoted. Though the Wi-Fi based positioning has become the mainstream of indoor positioning technology, the large deployment and maintenance cost limits its widespread use. In this paper, we proposed a novel zero-cost and map-free shop-level localization algorithm. The algorithm collected Wi-Fi fingerprinting data and opportunistic GPS data when customers paid the bill through mobile payment app. This algorithm takes each shop identification as a location index and localizes user without the need of the map. The Wi-Fi fingerprints and GPS data are collected in the background when crowdsourcing users employ the mobile payment APP, so our proposed localization algorithm can work without any site survey. To improve the positioning accuracy and speed up localization calculation, we introduce a hierarchical classification method based on ensemble learning model. The upper classifier dynamically selects several local candidate shops with an online Wi-Fi fingerprinting, with the virtue of reducing the computational complexity. After completing the upper classification, we further perform a confidence-weighted ensemble classification combing using GBDT, random forest and KNN to estimate the user location. By aggregating the location estimations of individual classifiers with their corresponding positioning accuracy, the confidence-weighted ensemble classification model can obtain more accurate location estimation. The paper also introduces some features, i.e., historical shop scanning Wi-Fi ratio, Wi-Fi signal statistics, store type and transaction time distribution, to improve the accuracy of the bottom shop classifier. Extensive experimental results show that our proposed method outperforms the maximum likelihood estimation and KNN algorithm, and can localize user with more than 92% accuracy.","","978-1-5386-3755-5","10.1109/UPINLBS.2018.8559708","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8559708","Indoor localization;Crowdsourcing fingerprints;Wi-Fi fingerprints;Hierarchical classification;Ensemble learning","Location awareness;Crowdsourcing;Maximum likelihood estimation;Online banking;Computational modeling;Fingerprint recognition;Classification algorithms","","6","","24","IEEE","6 Dec 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Further, the lack of a substantial user-base can be problematic to ensure statistical significance within a reasonable duration. In this paper we propose Kaleidoscope, an automated tool to evaluate Web features at a large scale, quickly, accurately, and at a reasonable price. Kaleidoscope can test two crucial user-perceived Web features - the style and page loading. As far as we know, it is the first testing tool to replay page loading by controlling visual changes on a webpage. Kaleidoscope allows to concurrently load a webpage in two versions (e.g., different fonts, with vs without ads) that are shown to a participant side-by-side. Further, Kaleidoscope also allows a participant to interact with each webpage version and provide feedback, e.g., respond to a questionnaire previously prepared by an ""experimenter"". Kaleidoscope supports both voluntary and paid testers from FigureEight, a popular crowdsourcing platform. Using hundreds of FigureEight testers, we validate that Kaleidoscope matches the accuracy of trusted in-lab tests while providing results about 12x faster (and arguably at a lower cost) than A/B testing.

The successful technology adoption and commercial deployment rely on a comprehensive understanding of the economic interactions among different network entities involved in such a system. In this paper, we focus on the economic interactions between one content provider (CP) and a large number of EDs, where the CP shares a certain revenue with EDs as the incentive of caching contents, and EDs decide whether to cache contents and share the cached contents with others. We formulate their interactions as a two-stage Stackelberg game. In Stage I, the CP decides the ratio of revenue shared with EDs, aiming at maximizing its own profit. In Stage II, each ED chooses to be an agent who caches contents and shares the cached contents with other EDs, or a requester who does not cache but requests contents from agents. e first analyze the existence and uniqueness of the Stage II subgame equilibrium by using the evolutionary game theory. Then, we identify the piece-wise structure of the CP's profit function, and derive the optimal revenue sharing ratio for the CP in Stage I. Simulation results show that a higher revenue sharing ratio for EDs or a larger serving capacity of EDs can drive more EDs to choose to be agents and meanwhile achieve a higher total welfare for EDs at the equilibrium. Moreover, a larger content price of the CP will lead to a larger welfare loss for EDs.","1938-1883","978-1-5386-8088-9","10.1109/ICC.2019.8761364","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8761364","","Feature extraction;Optimization;Real-time systems;Runtime;Measurement;Visual odometry;Simultaneous localization and mapping","","5","","16","IEEE","15 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, existing task assignment algorithms that only consider the case of full completion may not perform well. In this paper, we investigate the optimal online task assignment without knowledge about future task arrivals, which makes it tradeoff to assign high utility task with large deadline or less utility but more urgent task. The problem of computing optimal assignment for deadline aware tasks is formalized as an integer optimization problem. A dynamic programming based online algorithm for finding the optimal strategy for task assignment subject to delay constraints is proposed. And the time complexity of the algorithm is O(maxiε{1, , n}{ri}nT), where ri is the total number of subtasks of task Ti, n is the number of total tasks, T is the deadline constraint. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithms have better performance in utility gain.","","978-1-5090-3936-4","10.1109/BDCloud-SocialCom-SustainCom.2016.37","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7723691","Task assignment;deadline aware;dynamic programming","Crowdsourcing;Heuristic algorithms;Delays;Optimization;Dynamic programming;Programming;Complexity theory","","5","","17","IEEE","31 Oct 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The common approach for spectrum monitoring is to build infrastructures (e.g. spectrum observatories), which cost much money and manpower but have relatively low coverage. To aid in this, we propose a crowdsourcing based spectrum monitoring system for a large geographical area that leverages the power of masses of portable mobile devices. The system can accurately predict future spectrum utilization and intelligently schedule the spectrum monitoring tasks among mobile secondary users accordingly, so that the energy of mobile devices can be saved and more spectrum activities can be monitored. We also demonstrate our system's ability to capture not only the existing spectrum access patterns but also the unknown patterns where no historical spectrum information exist. The experiment shows that our spectrum monitoring system can obtain a high spectrum monitoring coverage and low energy consumption.","2334-3125","978-1-7281-2376-9","10.1109/DySPAN.2019.8935832","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8935832","DSA;crowdsourcing;spectrum monitoring","Monitoring;Sensors;Mobile handsets;Crowdsourcing;Time-frequency analysis;Dynamic spectrum access","","5","","24","IEEE","19 Dec 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The main strategy for achieving this objective is to develop a model describing the preferences of the people by considering the characteristics of the transportation modes (such as cost, travel duration) and then to develop policies in order to improve the characteristics of the target transportation mode. These models are called utility models and have a long story. Nevertheless, the data needed for their fitting are difficult to get. One of the main issues in this case is how to collect the data and how to tune a model that can be easily scaled and adapted to different settings. In this paper, we describe the results achieved during the Open Agora project where the utility model is tined with crowdsourcing data coming from mobile phone applications and collected indirectly by the users.","2161-8089","978-1-5386-3593-3","10.1109/COASE.2018.8560512","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8560512","","Crowdsourcing;Adaptation models;Computer aided software engineering;Automation;Conferences;Fitting;Transportation","","5","","17","IEEE","6 Dec 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
