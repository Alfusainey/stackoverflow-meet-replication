We present TinyGenius, a methodology to validate NLP-extracted scholarly knowledge statements using microtasks performed with crowdsourcing.

However, it is potentially vulnerable to adversarial attacks as the service provider cannot manage workers' behavior. Malicious workers provide unreliable answers to manipulate the system. These attacks affect the truth inference process and thus leads to wrong answers for a targeted set of tasks. Eventually, this reduces the accuracy of aggregated results. Existing works have proposed various types of attacks in crowdsourcing systems and indicate that truth inference is the most affected one. So, we propose methods for defending these attacks for improving the truth inference process. We empirically evaluate the proposed truth inference method on a real and synthetic dataset.

MCS has gained substantial attention from both academic and industrial sectors as an effective method for data collection. Nevertheless, traditional MCS heavily relies on third parties to maintain system operations, which may lead to single-point failures and incur serious privacy concerns. The introduction of blockchain technology offers the potential to get rid of the third-party intermediaries. However, the inherent decentralized and transparent nature of blockchain also brings in new challenges related to privacy and trust. A critical challenge in the context of blockchain-based MCS is achieving anonymous authentication on trust. Despite the typical conflict between trust evaluation and anonymity, ensuring anonymity is a crucial privacy prerequisite for MCS, while trust plays a pivotal role in various MCS activities such as task selection and truth determination. In this paper, we present a demonstration of a novel blockchain-based MCS that provides a secure and efficient crowdsourcing platform for fair and effective allocation of tasks. Notably, we leverage Intel Software Guard Extensions (SGX) to achieve anonymous authentication within a decentralized environment. Through the implementation of a decentralized trust evaluation approach, our system enables accurate trust assessment.","2834-9946","979-8-3503-1929-3","10.1109/Blockchain60715.2023.00032","National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10411453","blockchain;anonymous authentication;Intel SGX;trust evaluation","Crowdsourcing;Privacy;Authentication;Blockchains;Peer-to-peer computing;Resource management;Task analysis","","","","10","IEEE","30 Jan 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This include the received signal level, received signal quality, drop rate, handover success rate, packet loss, latency, throughput, etc. The Palestinian ministry of telecommunications and information technology (MTIT) together with the Palestinian Telecom Regulatory Authority (PTRA) also conduct performance measurements for the mobile networks through drive tests to monitor the quality of service (QoS) measurements delivered by each mobile operator and compare them with the standard KPIs benchmark limits. They aim to enhance user experience and network efficiency. However, these performance measurements either from the MNOs or the regulation agency are limited and do not reflect the exact end user experience.

Survey from a number of countries showed that the average household expenditures had also increased, notably in the past two years. One way to alleviate the impact of the rise in goods prices is by being more selective in buying the items. Being selective means buying the items at the stores that offer the lowest prices. To do that, a mechanism to compare the prices of items between stores is needed, in which, the local pricewatch information solicitation and sharing (LoPrice) model was proposed. The challenge to the design of such model is in the choice of suitable approach for collecting the information on prices from different stores in a timely manner. In this paper, mobile crowdsourcing is proposed to be the approach that is able to address the challenge. Review on existing price comparison applications, including their advantages and disadvantages is also included. An exploratory survey was also performed, which revealed that the use of mobile crowdsourcing is able to provide timely information solicitation and sharing of prices.","","978-9-8975-8124-3","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7293910","Mobile Crowdsourcing;Price Comparison;Information Sharing Model;Information Solicitation Model","Mobile handsets;Crowdsourcing;Mobile communication;Mobile applications;Government;Companies","","","","15","","8 Oct 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We describe the platform and an example of use; to improve FQT estimation by creating reference labels against which automated algorithms can be benchmarked. A total of 501, 30s segments were extracted from 15 foetal ECG (FECG) recordings from a private database. 23 volunteers participated in the study and provided a total of 7,307 FQT annotations, which were aggregated using a probabilistic label aggregator (PLA). The best annotator identified by the PLA had a standard deviation in the change of FQT annotations of 13.35 ms and 35.52 ms when labelling FECG with `very good' and `poor' signal quality respectively. The PLA does not require any ground truth to identify the best annotator or annotations. Annotator accuracy was also shown to be a function of objective signal quality measures. The feasibility of the CrowdLabel annotation system for ECG crowdsourcing with an unknown ground truth, as well as the results of the first experiment conducted using such a platform have been demonstrated.","2325-8853","978-1-4799-4347-0","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7043161","","Abstracts;Browsers;Electrocardiography;Biology","","","","8","","19 Feb 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Further, the study provides a better understanding of the underlying factors that drive developers to contribute to GitHub and Stack Overflow, and the challenges they face when participating on either platform.The quantitative analysis showed that JavaScript remains a popular language, while knowledge and experience are the key factors driving expertise. On the other hand, qualitative analysis showed that soft skills such as effective and clear communication, analytical thinking are key factors defining an expert. We found that both knowledge and experience are only necessary but not sufficient conditions for a developer to become an expert, and an expert would necessarily have to possess adequate soft skills. Lastly, an expert's contribution to GitHub seems to be driven by personal factors, while contribution to Stack Overflow is motivated more by professional drivers (i.e., skills and expertise).

Therefore, predicting deleted questions is an important task. In this study, we propose a two stage hybrid approach -- DelPredictor -- which combines text processing and classification techniques to predict deleted questions. In the first stage, DelPredictor converts text in the title, body, and tag fields of questions into numerical textual features via text processing and classification techniques. In the second stage, it extracts meta features that can be categorized into: profile, community, content, and syntactic features. Next, it learns and combines two independent classifiers built on the textual and meta features. We evaluate DelPredictor on 5 years (2008 -- 2013) of deleted questions from Stack Overflow.

However, this method is inefficient and causes many duplicate questions to remain undiscovered. Therefore, this paper proposes a duplicate questions detection model based on semantic and relevance. The model employs Siamese BiLSTM to encode question pairs and captures the semantic interaction information of title and body through soft align attention and inference composition. The soft term match captures the relevance information in the title. We evaluate the effectiveness of the model in six question groups on Stack Overflow.

To address this imminent issue, in this paper, we bring a significant insight to leverage both social coding properties and code content for automatic detection of insecure code snippets in Stack Overflow. To determine if the given code snippets are insecure, we not only analyze the code content, but also utilize various kinds of relations among users, badges, questions, answers and code snippets in Stack Overflow. To model the rich semantic relationships, we first introduce a structured heterogeneous information network (HIN) for representation and then use meta-path based approach to incorporate higher-level semantics to build up relatedness over code snippets. Later, we propose a novel hierarchical attention-based sequence learning model named CodeHin2Vec to seamlessly integrate node (i.e., code snippet) content with HIN-based relations for representation learning. After that, a classifier is built for insecure code snippet detection. Integrating our proposed method, an intelligent system named iTrustSO is accordingly developed to address the code security issues in modern software coding platforms. Comprehensive experiments on the data collections from Stack Overflow are conducted to validate the effectiveness of our developed system iTrustSO by comparisons with alternative methods.","2473-991X","978-1-4503-6868-1","10.1145/3341161.3343524","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9073142","","Encoding;Software;Security;Semantics;Social network services;Task analysis;Intelligent systems","","","","40","","23 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It is a challenge to preserve the context of runtime stack and establish effective constraints under hybrid analysis techniques, which usually makes the solution path more run inefficient and affects the analysis results in accuracy. This paper proposes a method that combines hybrid analysis including taint analysis to detect the vulnerabilities of stack overflow. The method ensures accuracy while reducing the number of execution paths. The three vulnerabilities of stack overflow in the routed firmware selected for testing are successfully detected and the number of detected paths is controlled to about 10. In addition, the method is designed to decouple the vulnerability location and detection modules, providing a basis for subsequent research on a common vulnerability detection platform.","","979-8-3503-1980-4","10.1109/SWC57546.2023.10448822","Research and Development; Natural Science Basic Research Program of Shaanxi Province; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10448822","vulnerability discovery;MIPS;embedded security;binary security;binary analysis","Analytical models;Runtime;Hybrid power systems;Computer crashes;Testing;Microprogramming;Context modeling","","","","23","IEEE","1 Mar 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Instead of combining through pages or replies of irrelevant information, users can easily and quickly pinpoint relevant posts and answers using tags. Since User-submitted posts can have multiple tags, classifying tags in Stack Overflow can be challenging. This results in an imbalance problem between labels in the whole labelset. Pretrained deep-learning models with small datasets can improve tag classification accuracy. Common multi-label resampling techniques with machine learning classifiers can also fix this issue. Still, few studies have explored which resampling technique can improve the performance of pre-trained deep models for predicting tags. To address this gap, we experimented to evaluate the effectiveness of ELECTRA, a powerful deep learning pre-trained model, with various multi-label resampling techniques in decreasing the imbalance that induces mislabeling in Stack Overflow's tagging posts. We compared seven resampling techniques, such as LP-ROS, ML-ROS, MLSMOTE, MLeNN, MLTL, ML-SOL, and REMEDIAL, to find the best method to mitigate the imbalance and improve tag prediction accuracy. Our results show that MLTL is the most effective selection to tackle the inequality in multi-label classification for our Stack Overflow data with deep learning scenarios. MLTL achieved 0.517, 0.804, 0.467, and 0.98 from the metrics Precision@l, Recall@5, F1-score@1, and AUC, respectively.

Crowdsourcing task requesters usually offer different bonuses to assure desired worker performance. Most existing studies focus on the general crowdsourcing market, and lead to inconsistent observations on the impact of different incentive strategies on worker performance. There is a lack of studies investigating this issue in crowdsourcing more complex or intelligent tasks such as software crowdsourcing. Aims: To bridge the gap and develop better understanding of the relationship between task incentives and worker performance in the field of software crowdsourcing, this study aims at examining strategic pricing behaviors of task requesters on the most popular software crowdsourcing platform, i.e. TopCoder, and evaluating the impact of monetary incentives on worker performance. Method: We first present the characterization of two specific pricing strategies employed in software crowdsourcing marketplace, design a two-step methodology to detect and identify different pricing strategies, and propose an algorithm to examine the impact of pricing strategies on worker's behaviors in terms of task participation level, completion velocity and task quality. An exploratory case study is conducted to apply the proposed methodology and algorithm on a dataset extracted from the TopCoder platform. Results: The conceptualization of pricing strategies formulates common pricing behaviors in software crowdsourcing. Main analysis results include: 1) strategic pricing patterns are prevalent in software crowdsourcing practices; 2) higher task incentives can get potentially paid-off by higher performance such as more registrants, more submissions and quicker velocity; 3) however, higher incentives do not always improve submission score of software crowdsourcing tasks, similar to moral hazard problems in economics. This implies that it is necessary to increase task award modestly; 4) in addition, higher incentives can improve the internal code which is measured by code bugs and bad smells. Conclusions: We believe the preliminary findings on the pricing strategy are beneficial for both better pricing decision-making and improved crowdsourcing market efficiency and fairness, and hope to stimulate further discussions and research in strategic crowd coordination.","1949-3789","978-1-7281-2968-6","10.1109/ESEM.2019.8870175","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8870175","software crowdsourcing;monetary incentives;pricing strategy;worker behaviors;worker performance","Task analysis;Pricing;Crowdsourcing;Software;Estimation;Software algorithms;Predictive models","","4","","35","IEEE","17 Oct 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we propose a framework for finding such experts in a collaborative network. Accredited with recent works on distributed word representations, we are able to summarize text chunks from the semantics perspective and infer knowledge domains by clustering pre-trained word vectors. In particular, we exploit a graph-based clustering method for knowledge domain extraction and discern the shared latent factors using matrix factorization techniques. The proposed clustering method features requiring no post-processing of clustering indicators and the matrix factorization method is combined with the semantic similarity of the historical answers to conduct expertise ranking of users given a query.

The accepted answers will be important references for users when they encounter similar questions. Essentially, posting questions and giving answers is an interactive process occurring among community users, and choosing accepted answers is actually a decision-making process involving multiple factors. Previous works examined the impact on this decision process from the user, question and answer viewpoints. Social interactions between the questioners and answerers, although being popular according to our pre-analysis, have never been considered as a factor that can influence the decisions. To fill this gap, this paper first proposes a comprehensive answer acceptance model that integrates the answer features established by social interactions as well as information of users, questions and answers. We then divide social interactions into two stages and propose a method to calculate the relationship between the questioner and the answerer by analyzing these social interactions. Finally, we investigate the influence of social interactions for the acceptance of answers by performing logistic regression analysis. The results reveal several findings: (1) social-based features explain 16.6 % of the variance explained together, indicating that social interactions have significant and important effects on the acceptance of answers; (2) social interactions that occur after the answer is posted are more influential than these occur before the answer is posted. Based on the findings, we further conduct an online study of 132 SO users, and the respondents report that social interactions have a greater impact on the acceptance of answers than other judgments of answers such as upvotes, downvotes and not accepting answers.","2640-0715","978-1-7281-9553-7","10.1109/APSEC51365.2020.00051","National Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61532004); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9359261","answer acceptance model;Q&A community;Stack Overflow;social interaction","Analytical models;Decision making;Transforms;Predictive models;Regression analysis;Logistics;Software engineering","","1","","34","IEEE","1 Mar 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

ITS makes use of various sensing and communication technologies to assist transportation authorities and vehicles drivers in making informative decisions and provide leisure and safe driving experience. Data collection and dispersion are of utmost importance for the proper operation of ITS applications. Numerous standards, architectures and communication protocols have been anticipated for ITS applications. However, existing schemes are based on assumption that vehicles and roadside devices are equipped with sensing and communication capabilities. One of the major gaps of these approaches is their inability to capture events that can easily be logged by drivers using their mobile phones. In this paper, we propose to fill the gap by the use of Crowdsourcing in ITS namely, CrowdITS. In CrowdITS human inputs, along with available sensory data, are collected and communicated to a processing server using mobile phones. The basic idea is to use the Crowd with smart mobile phones to enable certain ITS applications without the need of any special sensors or communication devices, both in-vehicle and on-road. Alternatively, we integrate and aggregate human inputs with multiple information sources, and then selectively disseminate the aggregated information based on the driver's geo-location. Conceptually, the major change is to integrate human inputs, with multiple information sources, aggregate and finally it is localized according to the driver's geo-location. We describe the design of CrowdITS, report on the development of key ITS applications using Android and iPhone mobile phones, and outline the future work in the development of crowdsourced-based applications for intelligent transportation systems.","1558-2612","978-1-4673-0437-5","10.1109/WCNC.2012.6214379","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6214379","","Vehicles;Servers;Mobile handsets;Google;Sensors;Real time systems;Global Positioning System","","59","2","12","IEEE","11 Jun 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Protecting location privacy is an important concern in SC, as an adversary with access to individual whereabouts can infer sensitive details about a person (e.g., health status, political views). Due to the challenging nature of protecting worker privacy in SC, solutions for this problem are quite complex, and require tuning of several parameters to obtain satisfactory results.

By exploiting the connection between probability of mis-classification and entropy at each level of the decision tree, we propose two algorithms for decision tree design. Furthermore, the worker assignment problem is studied when workers can be assigned to different tests of the decision tree to provide a trade-off between classification cost and resulting error performance.

It has recently drawn substantial attention of the smart cities and urban computing communities. In fact, the built-in cameras of mobile devices are becoming the most common way for visual logging techniques in our daily lives. MCS photo-based frameworks collect photos in a distributed way in which a large number of contributors upload photos whenever and wherever it is suitable. This inevitably leads to evolving picture streams which possibly contain misleading and redundant information that affects the task result. In order to overcome these issues, we develop, in this paper, a solution for selecting highly relevant data from an evolving picture stream and ensuring correct submission. The proposed photo-based MCS framework for event reporting incorporates (i) a deep learning model to eliminate false submissions and ensure photos credibility and (ii) an A-Tree shape data structure model for clustering streaming pictures to reduce information redundancy and provide maximum event coverage. Simulation results indicate that the implemented framework can effectively reduce false submissions and select a subset with high utility coverage with low redundancy ratio from the streaming data.","1558-3899","978-1-7281-2788-0","10.1109/MWSCAS.2019.8884949","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8884949","Classification;deep learning;event reporting;mobile crowdsourcing;smart city.","Task analysis;Sensors;Crowdsourcing;Redundancy;Servers;Data models;Urban areas","","10","","12","IEEE","31 Oct 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

They impact communication and coordination practices. This study aims to identify barriers to collaboration in SW CS and communication practices that might help overcome these barriers. We identified the barriers and practices from a qualitative data analysis study considering an available literature review report.
