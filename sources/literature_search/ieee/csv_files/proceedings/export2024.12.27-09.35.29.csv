Typical solutions resort to a rehearsal buffer to replay old data, which is intractable to apply in real-world scenarios with limited memory and inaccessible privacy. Recently, with the emergence of large-scale pre-trained models, prompting methods have rapidly become a popular rehearsal-free alternative to rehearsal-based methods. The core of prmopting is to encode knowledge leveraging a set of parameters, however, knowledge decoupling and complementarity still remain some challenges. To tackle these challenges, this paper presents a KnowledgeComplementary Prompting approach, KC-Prompt, which end-to-end integrates and releases the task-invariant and task-specific knowledge for the ViT backbone. KC-Prompt designs knowledge maintenance and knowledge sharing mechanisms to form complementary prompt generators. In addition, we employ a components weighting method to instantiate prompt generators, making the training process fully differentiable. Sufficient experiments on CIFAR-100 and Split ImageNet-R benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of KC-Prompt in the challenging and realistic class-incremental learning setting.","2379-190X","979-8-3503-4485-1","10.1109/ICASSP48485.2024.10446398","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10446398","continual learning;incremental learning;catastrophic forgetting;stability-plasticity dilemma;prompt","Training;Learning systems;Data privacy;Signal processing;Maintenance engineering;Benchmark testing;Generators","","","","28","IEEE","18 Mar 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A key requirement for the provisioning of context-aware applications is to give computer systems the ability to understand context information. Semantic languages are well suited to leverage the possibility to express, process and reason about context information and to facilitate knowledge sharing and interoperability among previously unknown entities accessing services from heterogeneous devices. However, the exploitation of semantic languages for the design and deployment of context-aware applications raises new challenges, mainly due to the high degree of heterogeneity that mobile devices exhibit in terms of computing power, memory, operating system, and supported software. Semantic languages require complex and heavyweight support facilities, e.g. metadata interpreters, reasoning engines and ontology repositories, that may not fit the capabilities of all user access devices, especially of the resource-limited ones. Novel solutions are required that are capable of transparently and dynamically adapting semantic support functionalities to the properties of the different user access devices. The paper proposes a novel middleware solution that exploits the visibility of two kinds of metadata, user/device profiles and policies, to tailor semantic support functionalities and that offers a wide set of mechanisms for providing on demand appropriate semantic support to mobile portable devices.","","0-7695-2263-7","10.1109/SAINTW.2005.1620000","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1620000","","Internet;Ontologies;Application software;Search engines;Middleware;Personal digital assistants;Context-aware services;Mobile computing;Portable computers;Operating systems","","","","6","IEEE","8 May 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It brings together the three very diverse fields of nanotechnology, molecular biology and biomedical informatics that until now have had little overlap and where major cultural gaps exist. It is critical that nanobioinformatics be embraced as an extension of biomedical informatics and not be orphaned prematurely. Because of the combinatorial nature of nanoparticle composition (core + surface modifier + payload) and the enthusiasm for this area in general, nanotechnology in biomedicine will see a rapid exponential increase in the data produced, thus making it critical to develop robust infrastructure to support data standardization and storage, modeling and simulation, symbolic reasoning and information retrieval. The goal of the multi-institutional Center for Cancer Nanotechnology Excellence focused on therapy response (CCNE-TR) at Stanford University is to develop a combined ex vivo nanosensor and in vivo molecular imaging approach toward highly sensitive tracking of prostate cancer response to therapy. As a part of this effort, we are developing an informatics platform to serve the diverse needs of this group. In particular, our data portal is designed to support electronic communication and data sharing within the center as well as data and knowledge sharing with the greater scientific community. We are developing this platform to be caBIG compatible integrating a number of different caBIG components that are each the best of breed solution for their particular area.

Through scenarios based on real situations, and tested in a real industrial environment (a Skoda car manufacturing production plant), the wearIT@work project demonstrates how wearable technology can allow an efficient, successful working environment by providing ubiquitous, mobile access to production process-related information where and when necessary: at the shop floor, at the assembly line, and at the manufacturing workstations. This allows workers at different levels to improve the training process of inexperienced workers, to improve availability of information, to speed up localisation and detection of areas to be repaired or maintained as well as to improve communication and knowledge sharing.

Each expert has their own way to design their ontologies using their own structures. This introduces a challenging problem of how to establish communication channels between these diversities. Ontology mapping is a good method to solve these problems by building relations between these ontologies. The core of ontology mapping is to compute the similarities between these concept pairs. In early years, researchers considered only single similarity for their ontology mapping. Recently, the scale of ontology has become more complicated. More researchers try to filter out all the possible similarities to combine concepts together to get a better result of mapping. One of the important similarity is the semantic similarity. In semantic similarity, how to get the attributes or properties to improve the scope of searching is an important part. This paper presents a method to improve the system by enriching the semantic similarity to expand the scope of the searching area. Constituting semantic similarity with other relations make the system have a better result in finding the correct similarity combinations and produce high possibility of successful mapping.","","978-1-4799-4584-9","10.1109/CACS.2014.7097193","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7097193","Ontology;Ontology Mapping;Semantic Enrichment;Similarity combination","Semantics;Ontologies;Speech;Mathematical model;Filtering;Benchmark testing;Electrical engineering","","","","10","IEEE","30 Apr 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This is because RL-based TSC methods have a high dependency on accurate modeling of the environment. With transportation infrastructure constraints, some vehicle dynamic information in the road network is difficult to obtain in real-time, which strongly limits the capability of RL agents. To address this problem, we propose a novel real-time federated traffic signal control system named RTLight, which can efficiently control traffic lights in real-time for multi-intersection scenarios. Based on the digital twin, the RL agent can obtain sufficient traffic information and interact with the environment in real time. Inspired by federated learning, our system supports knowledge sharing among intersections, which improves the overall convergence rate and control performance. Note that, we have deployed our RTLight system for large-scale application validation in Xishan district, Wuxi, China. Experimental results obtained from various real-world traffic scenarios demonstrate that RTLight can significantly improve the control performance.","2576-3172","979-8-3503-2857-8","10.1109/RTSS59052.2023.00055","Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62272170); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10406112","","Transportation;Reinforcement learning;Control systems;Real-time systems;Digital twins;Vehicle dynamics;Convergence","","","","22","IEEE","6 Feb 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The goal eleventh in the SDGs is ""sustainable cities and communities."" Inside the goal eleventh of the SDGs has ten targets. The target number 11.2 of the goal eleventh in the SDGs aims at affordable and sustainable transportation. How have the NGOs based in Bangkok promoted the target number 11.2 of the goal eleventh in the SDGs during 2016 - 2020, the research found that there are ten NGOs based in Bangkok involved in road safety promotion and sustainable transport building, which promoted the target number 11.2 of the goal eleventh of the SDGs in change agent perspective. NGOs advocate the SDGs and assist the public sector in developing a sustainable public transport system and using the SDGs as a tool to create the liability of their projects. There are three prominent roles of NGOs in promoting the SDGs comprise (1) collaborating with the public sector, (2) implementing projects, and (3) raising public awareness. Even though the roles of NGOs are broader at the general level, but the weaknesses of NGOs based in Bangkok are related to the low influence of NGOs in the policy-making process. Some NGOs receive funds from government agencies or private companies, this limits their ability to provide unbiased inputs in some sensitive issues that relevant to their funders. Moreover, NGOs have limited implementation capacity and resources, making it harder to corporate with the public sector. Significantly, influencing the public sector in developing affordable and sustainable transport systems is a troublesome issue for NGOs because most public transportation projects are related to the conflict of interests and authoritarians. They may have the ability only in public advocacy and knowledge sharing about the importance of sustainable transport systems at the public level.","","978-1-6654-3349-5","10.1109/ICBIR52339.2021.9465852","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9465852","Non-governmental Organizations;NGOs;SDGs;Bangkok;Goal Eleventh;Promotion;Target number 11.2","Systematics;Urban areas;Tools;Road safety;Regulation;Reliability;Public policy","","","","8","IEEE","29 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The primary goal of this businesses is to enlarge the effectiveness that can be achieved using the characteristics like one-click purchase, suggestions based on past attitude, specification-driven virtual catalogues and sophisticated search where the social purchasing feature was mostly neglected. Hence the present paper aims to deeply review the factors that influence the success of social ecommerce in Saudi Arabia. Therefore, the paper considers secondary data for data collection with the help of resources like website source, journal articles, and other published materials. Study findings examined that some important factors are information quality, information or knowledge sharing, trust, relationship quality and network.","","978-9-3805-4434-2","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8991228","E-commerce;web 2.0;information technology;social commerce;customer satisfaction","","","","","54","","13 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"Designing a System for Enhancing the Sharing of Best Teaching Practices among Universities’ Instructors","N. Almujally; M. Joy","Department of Computer Science, The University of Warwick, Coventry, UK; Department of Computer Science, The University of Warwick, Coventry, UK",2020 IEEE 20th International Conference on Advanced Learning Technologies (ICALT),"4 Aug 2020","2020","","","127","129","Many universities still face difficulties when attempting to improve the sharing of knowledge accumulated by instructors, due to geographical and social constraints. Insufficient knowledge sharing can significantly hinder the successful implementation of teaching expertise, and this can affect instructors' teaching performance and may result in lower levels of learner attainment than could otherwise have been achieved. In this design science research, we therefore propose (1) a prototypical teaching practices management framework (TPMF) and (2) a set of design principles and features for an information system that support the sharing of BTPs and may constitute a viable alternative to traditional approaches. The development of TPMF, the design principles and features has been informed by interviews conducted with 22 instructors. In this research-in-progress paper, we present our preliminary results and discuss next steps.","2161-377X","978-1-7281-6090-0","10.1109/ICALT49669.2020.00044","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9155735","design science research;knowledge sharing;knowledge management system;higher education institutions","Education;Information systems;Knowledge management;Interviews;Search problems;Tools;Knowledge acquisition","","","","13","IEEE","4 Aug 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Our duty is to reshape our earlier plans according to current era. Our Main Focus of this paper is to provide the awareness about education for students with the help of social networks and discussed various learning tools available online to enhance the effectiveness of their learning and knowledge sharing habits. No single e-learning method is best for every learning need. we will most likely need to use several e-learning technologies as well as traditional learning methods. This study is to help out the online learners to choose learning tools based on their requirements. Data mining automates the process of locating and extracting the hidden patterns and knowledge.","","978-1-4673-2225-6","10.1109/ICEELI.2012.6360665","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6360665","e-learning;Data Mining;Social Networks;Classification","Data mining;Electronic learning;Social network services;Educational institutions;Multimedia communication;Streaming media","","","","17","IEEE","24 Nov 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, there is no agreement on how their performance and impact can be measured. Social Network Analysis (SNA) has been used to analyze OSL; however, limitations have been pointed out such as many studies apply SNA superficially, the sample size of the majority of them is small, and many studies are not grounded in any theoretical framework. This paper presents an approach to assess large Virtual Communities of Practice (VCoP) used in OSL. Our approach aims to systematize the process of assessing social interactions in VCoP based on the value creation theoretical framework. It combines SNA measures and analysis of the discussions' structure in order to identifying behavioral patterns associated to learning. The results point out a set of quantitative measures which shows that participation and ongoing collaboration have a fundamental role for VCoP knowledge-sharing in informal settings.","2161-377X","978-1-7281-6090-0","10.1109/ICALT49669.2020.00042","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9155560","Online Social Learning;Social Network Analysis;Virtual Communities of Practice;Assessment","Conferences","","","","23","IEEE","4 Aug 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
