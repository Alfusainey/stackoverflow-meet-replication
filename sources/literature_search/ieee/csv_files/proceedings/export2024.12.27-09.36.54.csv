These options give a great opportunity for researcher to use it as a domain concept between low-level features and high-level concepts for image retrieval. The collection of images attached to entities, such as on-line news articles with images, are abundant on the Internet. Still, it is difficult to retrieve accurate information on these entities. Using entity names in a search engine yields large lists, but often results in imprecise and unsatisfactory outcomes. Our goal is to populate a knowledge base with on-line image news resources in the BBC sport domain. This system will yield high precision, a high recall and include diverse sports photos for specific entities. A multi-modality ontology retrieval system, with relational facts about entities for generating expanded queries, will be used to retrieve results. DBpedia will be used as a domain sport ontology description, and will be integrated with a textual description and a visual description, both generated by hand. To overcome semantic interoperability between ontologies, automated ontology alignment is used. In addition, visual similarity measures based on MPEG7 descriptions and SIFT features, are used for higher diversity in the final rankings.","2166-0700","978-1-61284-353-7","10.1109/STAIR.2011.5995779","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5995779","Image Retrieval;Ontology;DBpedia;Text Retrieval;Multi-Modality Ontology and Sport News","Ontologies;Semantics;Image retrieval;Feature extraction;Encyclopedias;Internet","","10","","21","IEEE","22 Aug 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We extend an existing stochastic model for user behavior, focusing on advocate-follower relationships. The new user posting model includes retweets, replies, and mentions as user responses. To capture emergence, we propose a RPBS (Rising, Plateau, Burst and Stabilization) topic pervasiveness model with a new metric that captures how frequent and in what form the community is talking about a particular topic.

We consider that the CRs are intelligent radios implementing a learning process through which they interact with the surrounding environment to make self-adaptive decisions. However, in distributed settings the learning may be complex and slow, due to interactive decision making processes, which results in a non-stationary environment. The docitive paradigm proposes a timely solution based on knowledge sharing, which allows CRs to develop new capacities for selecting actions. We demonstrate that this improves the CRs' learning ability and accuracy, and gives them strategies for action selection in unvisited states. We evaluate the docitive paradigm in the context of a secondary system modeled as a multi-agent system, where the agents are IEEE 802.22 CR base stations, implementing a real-time multi-agent reinforcement learning technique known as decentralized Q-learning. Our goal is to solve the aggregated interference problem generated by multiple CR systems at the receivers of a primary system.

With Web 2.0's further development, corporations aim to adopt its technologies and transfer its benefits, such as enhanced collaboration and knowledge sharing, to their organizations. Whether any of these benefits also apply in an organizational context and whether there are further, still uncovered, benefits remains unclear. Furthermore, research in this area is still in its early stages, thus hampering progress towards qualitative and quantitative models that could provide answers. In order to encourage further progress in this area, we reviewed the existing research on corporate blogging and identified 24 articles that investigate the topic. Using the framework by Ives et al., we categorized the articles for further analysis. By means of process theory, we build a conceptual model and identify the antecedents and consequences of internal corporate weblog usage. Our findings suggest that usage is driven by organizational culture, as well as by attitudes towards blogging.

Several approaches have been emerged for this purpose. In this paper, we present a practical study of methods that take data models as input to the learning process. The main contributions of this work are: (i) the evaluation of the availability of existing approaches for (semi-)automatic generation of ontology from data models; (ii) the evaluation of tools according to their operability; and (iii) the evaluation of the resulting ontologies to assess their quality in supporting semantic interoperability.

As a natural consequence, the focus is changing from data fusion to knowledge fusion. This new reality creates the need for advanced techniques that exploit not only the syntactic structure of knowledge bases, but also the semantic content. Ontologies play a major role in semantically aware systems, providing a means for highly effective knowledge sharing. However, they lack a standardized treatment of uncertainty, a ubiquitous feature of multisource fusion problems. This paper discusses the applicability of Probabilistic Ontologies designed in Probabilistic OWL (PR-OWL) to address this unmet need. The potential of PR-OWL probabilistic ontologies is demonstrated through a case study in the counterterrorism domain. A simple PR-OWL ontology for the case study was implemented using a recently released PR-OWL knowledge representation and reasoning system.","","978-3-8007-3092-6","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4632375","Probabilistic Ontologies;Bayes Theorem;Semantic Systems;Multi-Entity Bayesian Networks","Ontologies;Probabilistic logic;Uncertainty;Bayesian methods;Random variables;OWL;Cognition","","9","","14","","26 Sep 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We describe RASCAL, a recommender agent that continually recommends a set of task-relevant library methods to a developer. RASCAL learns information regarding how a particular reusable library is used and then employs this insight to make task-relevant recommendations to a developer. In this paper we detail our RASCAL agent and compare two recommendation techniques, namely Memory-Based and Model-Based Collaborative Filtering. We are interested in producing a scalable and efficient real-time recommender and thus ideally would favour a Model-Based approach. However, each scheme is evaluated against both runtime performance and recommendation accuracy.

Our goal is to efficiently learn a model for a new task or new view by selectively transferring knowledge learned from previous tasks or views. To this end, we propose a latent space lifelong MTMV (lslMTMV) learning method to exploit task relatedness and information from multiple views. In this new method, we map views to a shared latent space and then learn a decision function in the latent space. Our new method supports knowledge sharing among multiple views and knowledge transfer from existing tasks to a new learning task naturally. We have evaluated our method using 3 real-world data sets.

This model helps agents to make decisions according to preference values and is built upon ontology based knowledge sharing, bayesian networks based uncertainty management and influence diagram based decision support. The Multi-Agent System decision-reaction architecture is developed in a distributed perspective and is composed of three basic layers: low level, intermediate level and high level. The proposed approach has been illustrated based on the network architecture for heterogeneous mobile computing developed by the BARWAN project. Accordingly: the Building Area constitutes the low level and aims to be the interface between the main architecture and the targeted infrastructure. The Campus-Area is the intermediate level responsible of correlating the alerts coming from different domains of the infrastructure and to smartly deploy the reaction actions.","","978-1-4244-5880-6","10.1109/ARES.2010.57","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5438119","security;decision system;reaction;distributed network;bayesian network;multi agent system","Information security;Computer architecture;Multiagent systems;Information systems;Telecommunications;Ontologies;Bayesian methods;Uncertainty;Computer network management;Knowledge management","","8","","35","IEEE","25 Mar 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Objective: To understand how SPMs make decisions based on how they interpret their experiences in the workplace, and also to identify antecedents and consequences of those decisions in order to increase the effectiveness of project management. Method: Semi-structured interviews were carried out with SPMs within a Brazilian large private organization. The data was analyzed using techniques from grounded theory approach. Results: We found that decision-making in software project management is based on knowledge sharing in which the SPM acts as a facilitator before making decisions. This phenomenon is influenced by individual factors, such as experience, communication, negotiation, self-control and systemic view of the project and by contextual factors such as the autonomy of the SPM and team members' technical competence. Also, these factors are mediated by cognitive biases. Conclusions: Due to the uncertainty and dynamism inherent in software projects, the SPMs focus on making, monitoring and adjusting decisions in an argument-driven way.","","978-1-4503-4155-4","10.1145/2897586.2897598","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7809479","Software Project Management;Decision-Making;Grounded Theory","Decision making;Software;Organizations;Project management;Interviews;Biological system modeling;Context","","8","","37","","9 Jan 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the knowledge is not only stored in repositories but is also shared in the office space. Agile software development teams use the benefits of shared space to foster knowledge creation. But it is difficult to create and share this type of knowledge, when team members are distributed. This participatory single-case study indicates that, distributed team members rely heavily on knowledge codification and application of tools for knowledge sharing. We have found that, the studied project did not use any specific software or hardware that would enable spatial knowledge creation and sharing.

As drone-related commercial and civilian applications are flourishing, Internet-of-Drones (IoD) is moving into the fast lane and quickly becoming a highly anticipated network paradigm, where drones and Zone Service Providers (ZSPs) coordinate knowledge sharing in a reliable, accurate, and efficient way. However, for the sake of both strategic and financial value to business and mission critical applications, it is of vital importance to address both data security and privacy preservation issues brought by drones' inherent resource constraints and wide-open wireless medium. In this paper, we propose a secure data collection and storage mechanism, also called SecureIoD, for the IoD environment. In SecureIoD, drones and ZSPs first mutually authenticate each other and establish a secure session key before sharing any sensitive data via an insecure wireless channel. Then, ZSPs pack the collected data into blocks and compete to add their blocks into the blockchain. We also propose a joint Proof-of- Work (PoW) and Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism to select the miner ZSP, where the more transactions are in the block, the easier a ZSP can solve the cryptographic puzzle. We present security verification and analysis to show that SecureIoD can resist various security attacks. Finally, we develop a real-world testbed, implement SecureIoD and existing SDDM and BACSIoD schemes, and carry out extensive simulation experiments for performance evaluation and analysis. Experimental results reveal that not only does SecureIoD have lower computation cost, energy consumption, miner selection time, and communication overhead, but also offer better security features and capabilities.","2375-0324","978-1-6654-5176-5","10.1109/MDM55031.2022.00033","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9861105","Drone;Internet of Drones;Data Security;Authentication and Key Agreement;Data Storage;Blockchain","Wireless communication;Performance evaluation;Wireless sensor networks;Energy consumption;Analytical models;Data collection;Consensus protocol","","8","","40","IEEE","25 Aug 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Thanks to the wide deployment and the growing computing power of connected devices, the researchers can now consider in-situ with distributed learning processes where on connected devices, local learners collect data to improve the building management system knowledge. In-situ and distributed learning is a convincing direction for smart-buildings since they can better take into account users contexts, privacy concerns or the minimization of energy consumption. However, this direction introduces new challenges such as that of formulating distributed learning processes in which data are collected locally, aggregated to generate models which themselves serve to define a global intelligence. This paper considers the formulation of such a distributed learning process, Federated personalization: a distributed learning strategy where individual learners collaborate in a knowledge sharing round to benefit from shared generalization, yet retain local specificity. This research work proposes a federation framework to orchestrate a group of autonomous learners naturally distributed across smart buildings. The results show that leveraging inter learner knowledge transfer makes it possible to achieve personalized lower generalization loss for regression problems like forecasting time series data and image classification. The prototype is currently deployed at Qarnot, a French computing heater company to provide secure and sustainable autonomic ambient intelligence via edge devices.","","978-1-7281-9537-7","10.1109/ICAIS50930.2021.9395938","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9395938","Smart Buildings;Edge Computing;Federated Learning;Internet Of Things;Ambient Intelligence;Multi sensor Networks","Smart buildings;Smart cities;Time series analysis;Distributed databases;Collaborative work;Real-time systems;Space heating","","7","","26","IEEE","12 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Implementation is the critical gateway between the decision to adopt an innovation and the routine use of the innovation. In the case of IT innovation, while the development of IT innovation is relatively controllable, the actual implementation of IT is far more difficult to control as it involves complex interactions between people, technology and environment. Often times there is resistance in using the new technology and in many circumstances, the organization has to face IT implementation failure. In the context of higher education, there has been major transformation occurring in the formal education sector partly due to the development of IT innovation, as well as the form of networking, knowledge sharing and interactive learning that IT facilitate. Nevertheless, many universities are facing a lot of challenges in implementing IT innovation successfully. Although there have been some researches on the implementation of innovations in general, very few studies explored IT innovation implementation in the context of higher education. The purpose of this paper is to propose a conceptual framework for evaluating IT innovation implementation in higher educational institutions (HEIs), particularly in the developing countries.

We exploit the logical structure of predicates in a software architecture that enables a robot exposing its beliefs, and if required, it allows a human supervisor to apply corrections in a form akin to robot active perception. The paper critically discusses the design of the software components and their interfaces, discriminating between knowledge representation and dialogue management.

Different type of socialbased activities (e.g. online product shopping, question answering forums and etc.) create a vast connection between users. One of the most important features of these networks is knowledge sharing. This knowledge usually provides better insight for the users and consequently has a direct impact on the decision made by them. For example, online shopping members usually take their decision based on this shared information. But the main issue is there are a huge amount of shared knowledge without an accurate mechanism to determine their validity. One approach is to count more on the influential users opinions in the system and toward this end, several ranking algorithms have been proposed. But the existing algorithms for users ranking don't consider the personality features of users in their methodology. In this paper, we use this new feature of personality in the ranking algorithm for influential user detection in signed networks. We used Optimism and Pessimism scores as personality features of each user and employ it in the PageRank algorithm as a sample ranking algorithm and evaluated the new ranking results by using a new metric of credibility. To assess the performance of the proposed method, we applied it to a large dataset of Epinions signed networks. The results are compared with state-of-the-art expert finding algorithms which indicate that the personality feature can effectively improve the ranking and influential user detection accuracy.","","978-1-5090-3936-4","10.1109/BDCloud-SocialCom-SustainCom.2016.59","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7723713","Influential Users;Link Analysis;Expert Detection;Ranking algorithms;Credibility;Social Networks","Social network services;Algorithm design and analysis;Knowledge discovery;Feature extraction;Web pages;Advertising","","6","","39","IEEE","31 Oct 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This study seeks to address this gap by focusing on tacit knowledge management using tenets from cooperative learning theory. The research proposes that the sharing of tacit knowledge is made up of related sub-activities, and seeks more clarity in understanding autonomy, an antecedent that drives these activities.

Microblogging is getting more and more popular among educated and conscious people of Bangladesh. It is becoming another popular media which can provide entertainment and knowledge sharing about anything. Social Networking Sites (SNS) has become rendezvous of different people, different beliefs and interests to share and discuss. In this circumstance here we propose a model of e-governance using SNS for democratic Bangladesh perspective. Direct interaction between citizens and government can strengthen democracy. Accountability and transparency of politicians and government-workers can be ensured by flow of information to citizens of various developing activities.

Field Ready uses distributed manufacturing to produce essential non-food items locally where they are needed during humanitarian responses. Such supplies can be available to communities in need and to relief workers more quickly, more cheaply than alternatives, and provide appropriate solutions to problems, often engaging local people in designing and making necessary items, and supporting economic development. Scaling up this requires local production capabilities (skills, tools, and information such as designs), which can be boosted by adoption of these methods by aid agencies, international non-governmental organizations (INGOs) and others. Local manufacturing offers the potential for disaster affected communities to be engaged in recovery, and long term to become more resilient, with access to all the equipment and information required to make the supplies they need. However, there are challenges: appropriate quality control for distributed manufacture, unlocking the potential for in-region manufacturers to engage in humanitarian response, and uptake of digital knowledge sharing and collaboration to the humanitarian sector. In this paper, we share experiences of human-centred design and global collaboration to solve local problems, of manufacturing in remote and challenging locations, community building and bridging sectors through the Humanitarian Makers network, and new ideas for distributed manufacturing standards and quality.","","978-1-5090-6046-7","10.1109/GHTC.2017.8239297","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8239297","distributed manufacturing;open hardware;disaster relief;making;community;collaboration;quality control;testing;digital manufacturing","Manufacturing;Supply chains;Procurement;Technological innovation;Three-dimensional displays;Humanitarian activities;Standards","","6","","31","IEEE","25 Dec 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Particularly, detecting refactorings during code reviews is not a trivial task, since they are not explicitly represented in diffs. For example, a Move Function refactoring is represented by deleted (-) and added lines (+) of code which can be located in different and distant source code files. To tackle this problem, we introduce RAID, a refactoring-aware and intelligent diff tool. Besides proposing an architecture for RAID, we implemented a Chrome browser plug-in that supports our solution. Then, we conducted a field experiment with eight professional developers who used RAID for three months. We concluded that RAID can reduce the cognitive effort required for detecting and reviewing refactorings in textual diff. Besides documenting refactorings in diffs, RAID reduces the number of lines required for reviewing such operations. For example, the median number of lines to be reviewed decreases from 14.5 to 2 lines in the case of move refactorings and from 113 to 55 lines in the case of extractions.","2643-7171","978-1-6654-1403-6","10.1109/ICPC52881.2021.00033","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9463030","Refactoring;Refactoring-Aware Code Review;Code Review;Textual Diffs","Instruments;Software quality;Computer architecture;Tools;Browsers;Task analysis;Software development management","","6","","32","IEEE","28 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To enable knowledge sharing and reuse, current middleware make the assumption that a single, universally accepted, ontology exists with which queries and assertions are exchanged. We argue that such an assumption is unrealistic. Rather, different communities will speak different `dialects'; in order to enable cross-community interactions, thus increasing the range of services and information available to users, on-the-fly translations are required. In this paper we introduce MaLM, a middleware for pervasive computing devices that exploits an unsupervised machine learning technique called self-organising map to tackle the problem of ontology heterogeneity. At any given time, the MaLM instance running on a device operates in one of two possible modes: `training', that is, MaLM is autonomically learning how to group together semantically closed concepts; and `expert', that is, given in input a query or assertion expressed in a foreign dialect, MaLM identifies the concept, expressed in the device mother-tongue, that most closely represents it","","0-7695-2788-4","10.1109/PERCOMW.2007.64","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4144877","","Machine learning;Middleware;Ontologies;Pervasive computing;Protocols;Knowledge representation;Mobile communication;Computer science;Educational institutions;Application software","","6","","20","IEEE","2 Apr 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The problems of monotonicity of data forms and scarcity of medical data are the main reasons that currently limit the performance of ML approaches. In this research, we propose a novel similarity-based quantification approach that simultaneously considers the magnitude and direction relationships of structural variations among brain biomarkers, and encodes quantified data as third-order tensors to solve problem of data form monotonicity, then combining tensor multi-tasking learning model to predict AD progression. In this model, the prediction of each patient is considered as a task, and each task shares a set of latent factors obtained by tensor decomposition, knowledge sharing between tasks can improve the generalization of the model and solve the problem of scarcity of medical data. The model can be utilised to efficiently predict the progression of AD integrating magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data and cognitive scores of AD patients at different stages. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, we conducted extensive experiments utilising MRI data from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). The results reveal that the proposed model predicts AD progression more accurately and consistently than single-task and state-of-the-art multi-task regression approaches on various cognitive scores. The proposed approach can recognize brain structural variation in patients and apply it to reliably predict and diagnose AD progression.","","978-1-6654-6819-0","10.1109/BIBM55620.2022.9995468","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9995468","Alzheimer’s disease progression;amalgamated magnitude-direction quantification;brain structure variation;tensor multi-task learning","Tensors;Magnetic resonance imaging;Biological system modeling;Predictive models;Brain modeling;Multitasking;Data models","","6","","34","IEEE","2 Jan 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This chatbot can suggest the flow of investigation and the relevant commands that will help to obtain the results which need to be resolved the incident. Automate the incident ticket creation is one of major achievement of this research. Security analysts also receive messages of security alerts of the AWS hosted instances. Security analysts are also continuing to work on their sub tasks, quite overloaded with their main tasks to engage in collaborative investigations and knowledge sharing. Chat-Ops help to vanquish and meet those challenges. Processes, automated workflows, the chatbot, security tools, and humans exist in the same chat window feeding data and commands in a worthy cycle. It will lead to huge changes in everything from remediation times and investigation depth to future learning and knowledge administration. Different analysts will drive the investigation in different ways. Most of the time, analysts will miss most important parts and techniques, but those parts could be very valuable for the result. The investigation flow and commands will suggest based on past investigations and commands that previous analysts were used.

This is also due to facts that wikis and related Web technologies are evolving fast and that a lot of effort is spent on developing new, innovative wiki-based solutions for specific software engineering activities. Therefore, two case studies were conducted in which wikis were used as a technology for communication, documentation, and knowledge sharing. Based on the subjective judgments of undergraduate and graduate students, wikis were evaluated as most efficient for sharing software engineering experiences and project management related information. In addition, both case studies shed light on the kind of information that was shared most and on its quality for reuse.

In this context, collaborative reinforcement learning refers to the improvement of this learning process through the interaction between agents, which usually yields better results than training each agent in isolation. Most studies in this area have focused on the case with homogeneous agents, namely, agents equally skilled for undertaking their task. By contrast, heterogeneity among agents could arise due to the particular capabilities on how they sense the environment and/or the actions they could perform. Those differences eventually hinder the learning process and information sharing between agents. This issue becomes even more complicated to address over hard exploration scenarios where the extrinsic rewards collected from the environment are sparse. This work sheds light on the impact of leveraging collaborative learning strategies between heterogeneously skilled agents over hard exploration scenarios. Our study gravitates on how to share and exploit knowledge between the agents so as to mutually improve their learning procedures, further considering mechanisms to cope with sparse rewards. We assess the performance of these strategies via extensive simulations over modifications of the ViZDooM environment, which allow examining their benefits and drawbacks when dealing with agents endowed with different behavioral policies. Our results uncover the inherent problems of not considering the skill heterogeneity of the agents in the knowledge sharing strategy, and unleash a manifold of research directions aimed at circumventing these noted issues.","2161-4407","978-1-6654-3900-8","10.1109/IJCNN52387.2021.9534146","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9534146","Deep Reinforcement Learning;heterogeneous agents;collaborative training;intrinsic motivation;curiosity;sparse rewards","Training;Manifolds;Neural networks;Collaboration;Information sharing;Reinforcement learning;Minimization","","5","","35","IEEE","22 Sep 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper the recommendation task is defined as a knowledge based workflow and the knowledge grid is exploited as the platform for knowledge sharing and knowledge service which provides the functions of knowledge discovery, knowledge fusion and knowledge based workflow definition. The rationale of the knowledge grid based intelligent electronic recommender systems (KGBIECRS) is discussed and the service oriented architecture of the knowledge grid is presented. The knowledge grid depends on the semantic grid as the semantically interactive platform to intelligently coordinate the heterogeneous resources on the grid so that the recommendation task submitted by the knowledge grid as a knowledge based workflow can be performed intelligently and adaptively.

Therefore, simplifying the learning process is an important issue. In multi-agent systems, agents with the same target tasks or attributes often interact more with each other and exhibit behaviors more similar. That means there are stronger collaborations between these agents. Most existing multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithms expect to learn the collaborative strategies of all agents directly in order to maximize the common rewards. This causes the difficulty of policy learning to increase exponentially as the number and types of agents increase. To address this problem, we propose a goal-based hierarchical group communication (GHGC) algorithm. This algorithm divides the agents into different groups, and maintains the group's cognitive consistency through knowledge sharing. Subsequently, we introduce a group communication and value decomposition method to ensure cooperation between the various groups. Experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art MARL methods on the widely adopted StarCraft II benchmarks across different scenarios, and also possesses potential value for large-scale real-world applications.","2577-1655","978-1-7281-8526-2","10.1109/SMC42975.2020.9282974","Research and Development; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9282974","Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning;Goal-based Hierarchical Group Communication;Group’s Cognitive Consistency","Conferences;Collaboration;Reinforcement learning;Games;Task analysis;Cybernetics;Multi-agent systems","","5","","26","IEEE","14 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In addition, dataset is proposed to be treated as first-class citizen to drive the knowledge sharing and recommendation.

These tasks are often solved independently without utilizing some common problem-solving knowledge that could be extracted and shared among these tasks to augment the performance of solving each task. In this work, we propose a multi-task optimization (MTO) based co-training (MTO-CT) framework, where the models for solving different tasks are co-trained via an MTO paradigm in which solving each task may benefit from the knowledge gained from when solving some other tasks to help its solving process. MTO-CT leverages long short-term memory (LSTM) based model as the predictor where the knowledge is represented via connection weights and biases. In MTO-CT, an inter-task knowledge transfer module is designed to transfer knowledge between different tasks, where the most helpful source tasks are selected by using the probability matching and stochastic universal selection, and evolutionary operations like mutation and crossover are performed for reusing the knowledge from selected source tasks in a target task. We use electricity consumption data from five states in Australia to design two sets of tasks at different scales: a) one-step ahead prediction for each state (five tasks) and b) 6-step, 12-step, 18-step, and 24-step ahead prediction for each state (20 tasks). The performance of MTO-CT is evaluated on solving each of these two sets of tasks in comparison to solving each task in the set independently without knowledge sharing under the same settings, which demonstrates the superiority of MTO-CT in terms of prediction accuracy.","2161-4407","978-1-7281-8671-9","10.1109/IJCNN55064.2022.9892329","Australian Research Council (ARC)(grant numbers:LP180100114,DP200102611); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9892329","Multi-task optimization;inter-task knowledge transfer;source task selection;long short-term memory;mutation;crossover","Knowledge engineering;Neural networks;Stochastic processes;Predictive models;Multitasking;Australia;Task analysis","","4","","30","IEEE","30 Sep 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For these foundations to develop, clients initially need to exert high amounts of formal and clan controls to enforce learning activities against barriers to knowledge sharing.

A design ontology is a hierarchically structured set of terms for describing a design domain that can be used as a skeletal foundation for a knowledge base. It can help the collaborative design team by providing accurate design information and guidelines. This research develops a methodology called domain knowledge acquisition process (DKAP) for creating an ontology of product and process design using IDEF5 and generates a consistency matrix for checking the accuracy of captured information. DKAP is a step-by-step methodology, which captures the product & process design knowledge, stores this knowledge in a reusable format, and shares this knowledge across enterprises. DKAP addresses three critical aspects of a design ontology. It explores the availability of similar domain ontologies for reuse, checks the accuracy & consistency of captured knowledge, and allows the sharing of the captured knowledge.","2159-5119","978-1-8908-4315-1","10.1109/PICMET.2007.4349422","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4349422","","Design methodology;Ontologies;Process design;Collaboration;Design engineering;Knowledge engineering;Systems engineering and theory;Buildings;Manufacturing industries;Manufacturing systems","","4","","11","","15 Oct 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, in practice there is a lot of commonality in what different experts are trying to achieve. In this paper, we present the GOLDRUSH system, which facilitates knowledge sharing via effective adaptation of fraud detection rules from one context to another. GOLDRUSH abstracts the possible semantic interpretations of each of the conditions in the rules at the source context and adapts them to the target context. Efficient algorithms are used to identify the most effective rule adaptations w.r.t a given cost-benefit metric.

Users are actively connected to these services for creating and sharing contents and events with others, and, in some cases, this activity takes place in the scope of groups of interests. Therefore, from amongst the morass of data generated every day by users, a part of information may match the interests of certain groups. In practice, members are not all linked to each other via each OSN they are connected to. It is also not realistic to assume that each member can manually explore all others' social profiles to reach the information that may be relevant to their interests. Thus, there is a need for aggregating members' social streams on a single information support to collect relevant information, and, consequently, to promote collaborative knowledge-sharing. However, the disconnected nature of today social websites prevents a straightforward aggregation process. An efficient automated aggregation model is needed. We present, in this paper, the idea of empowering collaborative intelligence by the use of a user-centered approach for OSN aggregation. We illustrate the approach by a first experience to evaluate its impact on users information sharing and enrichment capabilities.","","978-0-7695-5145-6","10.1109/WI-IAT.2013.60","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6690046","social networks;user profiles aggregation;collaborative intelligence;knowledge management","Facebook;Collaboration;Twitter;Data models;Information management;Media","","4","","17","IEEE","23 Dec 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Obesity is an overnutrition disease that is associated with increased risks of many types of cancers. The knowledge of this medical domain is highly required to be represented with its concepts, properties and types of association using ontologies to provide the biomedical community with consistent, reusable and sustainable descriptions of human obesity related cancer terms. In this paper, we propose building Obesity Related Cancer (ORC) Ontology involving diseases, symptoms, diagnosis, and treatment, using the latest standard Web Ontology language (OWL 2). The diseases hierarchy and terms are defined upon the standard Disease Ontology (DO). By developing (ORC) Ontology, both intelligent systems and physicians can benefit from it in knowledge sharing, reasoning and reusing in different ways.","","978-1-4799-6594-6","10.1109/ICCES.2014.7030953","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7030953","Obesity;Cancer;Web Ontology Language (OWL );Disease Ontology;Knowledge Representation","Ontologies;Cancer;Medical diagnostic imaging;OWL;Diseases;Robustness;Surgery","","4","","20","IEEE","5 Feb 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Search engines on today's Web of documents are based on keyword queries. Search engines don't provide a sufficiently comprehensive solution to answer a query that permits personalization of open educational materials. To find OER on the Web today, users must first be well informed of which OER repositories potentially contain the data they want and what data model describes these datasets, before using this information to create structured queries. Learning analytics requires not only to retrieve the useful information and knowledge about educational resources, learning processes and relations among learning agents, but also to transform the data gathered in actionable e interoperable information. Linked Data is considered as one of the most effective alternatives for creating global shared information spaces, it has become an interesting approach for discovering and enriching open educational resources data, as well as achieving semantic interoperability and re-use between multiple OER repositories.

The co-design of business and IT systems is a process within which business systems of human activity and IT systems of information processing are mutually constituted. It requires the negotiation of competing technological frames across multiple knowledge domains. Three major challenges hinder effective innovation: (i) a mismatch between goal-driven IS design methods and the need for cross-functional knowledge-sharing, (ii) the distributed and partial knowledge possessed by stakeholders from diverse groups; (iii) the need to maintain interpretive flexibility across cycles of discovery and analysis. This paper develops an analytical framework for integrating knowledge frames across stakeholder groups, to provide a common language for the co- design of business and IT systems.","1530-1605","978-0-7695-3075-8","10.1109/HICSS.2008.20","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4439053","","Design methodology;Spirals;Humans;Information processing;Technological innovation;Uncertainty;Design engineering;Management information systems;Business communication;Data processing","","3","","23","IEEE","22 Jan 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Users post questions and pick questions to answer in the system. Due to the rapidly growing user population and the number of questions, it is unlikely for a user to stumble upon a question by chance that (s)he can answer. Also, altruism does not encourage all users to provide answers, not to mention high quality answers with a short answer wait time. The primary objective of this paper is to improve the performance of Q&A systems by actively forwarding questions to users who are capable and willing to answer the questions. To this end, we have designed and implemented SocialQ&A, an online social network based Q&A system. SocialQ&A leverages the social network properties of common-interest and mutual-trust friend relationship to identify an asker's friends who are most likely to answer the question. We describe the architecture, algorithms and user interface of SocialQ&A, and analyze the Q&A behavior of real users and questions from a small-scale real-world SocialQ&A system. We also conducted comprehensive large-scale simulation to evaluate SocialQ&A in comparison with other methods. Our results suggest that social networks can be leveraged to improve the answer quality and asker's waiting time.","1095-2055","978-1-4799-9964-4","10.1109/ICCCN.2015.7288468","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7288468","","Social network services;User interfaces;Search engines;Floods;Motion pictures;Computers;Measurement","","3","","34","IEEE","5 Oct 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In the future, computers will be required to play a lot more active role in performing a wide range of activities, such as collaboration, decision-making, task automation, data and information management, and so on, to create and share knowledge while assisting users in performing tasks. Computers will have to be a seamless and transparent part of our environment, and their design will have to concentrate as much on human centeredness as on other aspects of the system. Tomorrow's computer based environments will require an optimal integration of decision-making, knowledge management, and human computer interaction aspects. They will also need to be truly pervasive and ubiquitous in nature. The main goal of this paper is to propose an Information Grid-based approach towards realizing such human-centric computing systems in a distributed environment, in order to facilitate collaboration, knowledge sharing, and distributed decision-making, at both local and global levels. The proposed framework is a layered approach that incorporates decision making, human centeredness and knowledge management at various points in the architecture. A first step towards the implementation of such a system is also proposed by incorporating the HUDS architecture [16] in a grid-based scenario. This implementation incorporates four important properties, namely, pervasiveness, awareness, autonomicity, and human factors in order to make the system human centric in nature.","","978-1-4244-0011-9","10.1109/CCSP.2005.4977205","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4977205","Information Grid;P2P Networking;Collaboration Science;Knowledge Management;Decision Making;Human Computer Interaction","Collaboration;Distributed decision making;Decision making;Humans;Pervasive computing;Knowledge management;Computer science;Communications technology;Business communication;Automation","","3","","34","IEEE","26 May 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

They can be applied in various fields, such as education, business and healthcare. Due to its complexity, the design and development of a dialogue system is time consuming and costly. It is highly desirable for a generic dialogue system, especially dialogue management that is independent of specific domains. Methods for domain independent dialogue systems have been proposed in previous research, however each of them has its own limitations. This paper presents a new approach, a task ontology model for domain independent dialogue management. An abstract task ontology is developed and based on that a generic dialogue manager is created. Knowledge about a specific task is modeled in its task ontology and retrieved by an ontology reasoning component situated in the dialogue manager. Thus the dialogue system based on this model is task or domain independent. The dialogue system has been experimented with two different tutorial tasks: the book borrowing and the online train ticket booking. The results indicate that the dialogue system can be readily applied to tasks from different domains. This paper has implications on future research and development of domain independent dialogue systems and its application in tutoring and training in virtual environments. It also contributes to the knowledge sharing and reuse of human computer interfaces.","1944-9410","978-1-4577-1759-8","10.1109/VECIMS.2012.6273227","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6273227","dialogue systems;ontology;domain independent;task ontology;human computer interaction","Ontologies;Delta modulation;Abstracts;Adaptation models;Cognition;Educational institutions;Humans","","3","","13","IEEE","20 Aug 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
