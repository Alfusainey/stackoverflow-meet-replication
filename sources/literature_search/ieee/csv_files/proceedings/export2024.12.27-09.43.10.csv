"Towards Reliable Hypothesis Validation in Social Sensing Applications","D. Wang; D. Zhang; C.

While many previous studies in social sensing focus on the problem of ascertaining the reliability of data sources and the truthfulness of their reported claims (often known as truth discovery), this paper investigates a new problem of hypothesis validation where the goal is to validate some high-level statements (referred to as hypotheses) from the low-level statements (referred to as claims) embedded in the social sensing data. The truthfulness of hypotheses cannot be directly obtained from the truth discovery results and two key challenges are involved in solving the hypothesis validation problem: (i) how to match the hypotheses generated by end users to the relevant claims generated by social sensors? (ii) How to accurately validate the truthfulness of the hypotheses given the unknown reliability of data sources and unvetted truthfulness of the claims? This paper proposes a Reliable Hypothesis Validation (RHV) scheme to address the above challenges. In particular, we develop a critical claim selection approach to match the hypotheses with the relevant claims and derive an optimal solution to validate their truthfulness by exploring the complex relationship between hypotheses and claims. The performance of RHV scheme is evaluated on three datasets collected from real- world social sensing applications. The results show that the RHV scheme significantly outperformed the state-of-the-art baselines in terms of validating the truthfulness of hypotheses.","2155-5494","978-1-5386-4281-8","10.1109/SAHCN.2018.8397103","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8397103","","Reliability;Twitter;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Noise measurement;Intelligent sensors","","2","","41","IEEE","28 Jun 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In particular, we are interested in identifying the determinants of trust and acceptability when considering the combination of hybrid human-AI approaches for improving research practices. This includes the way as researchers assume human-centered artificial intelligence (AI) and crowdsourcing as valid mechanisms for aiding their tasks. Through the lens of a unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) combined with an extended technology acceptance model (TAM), we pursue insights on the perceived usefulness, potential blockers, and adoption drivers that may be representative of the intention to use hybrid intelligence systems as a way of unveiling unknown patterns from large amounts of data and thus enabling novel scientific discoveries.","","978-1-6654-3902-2","10.1109/BigData52589.2021.9671358","Foundation for Science and Technology; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9671358","artificial intelligence;crowdsourcing;human-AI interaction;hybrid collective intelligence;innovative scientific discovery;technology acceptance models","Geography;Crowdsourcing;Technology acceptance model;Big Data;Predictive models;Data models;Reliability","","2","","24","IEEE","13 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Advanced remote sensing systems have been developed towards the large-scale evidence-based monitoring of the CAP. Nevertheless, the spatial resolution of satellite images is not always adequate to make accurate decisions for all fields. In this work, we introduce the notion of space-to-ground data availability, i.e., from the satellite to the field, in an attempt to make the best out of the complementary characteristics of the different sources.

However, predicting the trust between two unknown participants based on the whole large-scale social network can lead to very high computation costs. Thus, prior to trust prediction, extracting a small-scale sub-network containing the important participants and the corresponding contextual information with a high density could make the trust prediction more efficient and effective. However, extracting such a sub-network has been proved to be an NP-Complete problem. To address this challenging problem, we propose a strong social component-aware trust sub-network extraction model, So-BiNet, to search for near-optimal solutions effectively and efficiently. Our method can extract a trust sub-network without any decompression, which can in turn greatly save the search time of trust sub-network extraction. The experiments, conducted on four social network datasets, demonstrate that our approach can efficiently extract sub-networks covering important participants and contextual information while keeping a high density. Our approach is superior to the state-of-the-art approaches in terms of the quality of the sub-networks extracted within the same execution time.","","978-1-5090-2675-3","10.1109/ICWS.2016.22","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7557991","trsut;sub-network extraction;trust prediction","Social network services;Context;Data mining;Reliability;Decision making;Context modeling;Monitoring","","2","2","28","IEEE","1 Sep 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Integrated with mobile crowdsourcing (MCS), radio map can be updated by mobile users in a low-cost manner. However, the crowdsourced measurement data may get quite sparse, and contain noises and errors. Therefore, how to efficiently infer missing data under low-quality measurements is critical in crowdsourced radio map construction. Existing inference methods like matrix completion require certain strict conditions, e.g. missing at completely random (MACR), which is impractical in the city-scale sensing. To address these issues, we propose a deep learning scheme based on adversarial auto-encoder (AAE) to handle measurements with large missing regions and complicated loss patterns. Specifically, this scheme applies variational auto-encoder (VAE) to infer missing data, and further utilizes the adversarial nets to play a min-max game with the VAE to improve recovery quality. Comprehensive experiments on three real datasets show that the proposed scheme can outperform state-of-the-art methods under large missing rates and low-quality measurements.","1558-2612","978-1-7281-9505-6","10.1109/WCNC49053.2021.9417253","National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9417253","","Deep learning;Crowdsourcing;Data integrity;Measurement uncertainty;Games;Loss measurement;Sensors","","2","","20","IEEE","5 May 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These users are generally the workers of crowdsourcing tasks released by the systems. However, due to the lack of strict authentication for user identity in many crowdsensing services, malicious attackers can sneak into normal workers and submit malicious data to the system to launch data poisoning attacks. Truth discovery algorithms aim to calculate workers' trustworthiness and try to find the ground truth from inconsistent data submitted by different workers. It can help the systems filter out some data providers with poor quality, and thus can defend against some simple data poisoning attacks, such as random attacks, max-value attacks, etc. However, we found that in multi-rounds of data collaction tasks, the attackers can still attack successfully by slightly modifying the simple poisoning strategies. Attackers can deceive the truth discovery algorithm by alternately submitting real and fake data, thereby mislead the system to infer the wrong truth. Therefore, in this paper we study the attack and defense methods for multi-round data poisoning against truth discovery in crowdsensing systems. First, we verify the vulnerability of a class of commonly used truth discovery framework under a multi-rounds of data poisoning strategy named “Hide-AttackPois”. Experiments show that only using a simple hide attack strategy can cause great disturbance to the output of the algorithm. Second, we optimize this class of truth discovery framework to enhance its robustness and enable it to defend against “Hide-AttackPois”. Then, we further improve the data poisoning attack model, so that the model can learn better attack strategies and effectively attack the optimized truth discovery framework. We conduct experiments on real dataset to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.","2375-0324","978-1-6654-5176-5","10.1109/MDM55031.2022.00036","National Key Research and Development Plan(grant numbers:2020YFB2009503); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9861181","Crowdsensing systems;data poisoning attack;deep reinforcement learning;truth discovery","Crowdsensing;Authentication;Reinforcement learning;Filtering algorithms;Data models;Robustness;Sensors","","2","","33","IEEE","25 Aug 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The F1-measure achieved in the validation dataset was 63% which is still far from excellent.

The main advantage of CPSSS is that users sharing a space can have highly immersive interactions by sharing three-dimensional images in multiple spaces. However, sharing all the information obtained from each space could violate the privacy of the participating users, thus necessitating the implementation of filtering, such as making certain aspects visible or invisible. On the other hand, making all images invisible compromises the sense of immersion; therefore, developing technologies for appropriate filtering according to various contexts is essential. This paper aims to develop privacy filtering technologies considering context and individual user characteristics by investigating privacy requirements for all possible objects to be shared in CPSSS. In preliminary research, we collected and analyzed data on different personality traits and privacy awareness for different objects through crowdsourcing with an online cooking class scenario. In this paper, we develop a method to infer privacy requirement levels using personality traits and object names as features. In the proposed method, first, we apply a text encoding using the distributed representation of object names to infer the privacy requirement level for unknown objects not included in the dataset. Second, to improve the inference accuracy of the privacy requirement level, we apply transfer learning to the requirement inference model for each user. As a result, we found that the method with word embedding improved the accuracy of recognizing the privacy requirement level by approximately 9 % compared to the baseline. In addition, implementing transfer learning improved accuracy by approximately 14%.","","978-4-907626-52-5","10.23919/ICMU58504.2023.10412252","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10412252","spatial sharing system;privacy awareness;word embedding;machine learning;transfer learning;home sensing","Crowdsourcing;Privacy;Data privacy;Filtering;Transfer learning;Encoding;Videos","","1","","15","","30 Jan 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Through collaboration with our partner law enforcement agency, we have developed a comprehensive categorization of offense types utilizing a crowdsourcing approach. Our system allows end-users to interactively specify the offense types and customize the performance metric based on their domain knowledge and policing priorities. The performance scores for each officer are then visualized based on a matrix representation. The representation supports a rich set of interactions including selection, filtering, ranking and correlation to allow end-users to supervise and refine the performance evaluation process. With our system, end-users can explore the activity patterns and performance trends for either a large group or an individual, and identify critical factors that help to improve the operational decision making process. To demonstrate the proposed approach, we present two case studies and provide domain expert feedback.","","978-1-5090-6356-7","10.1109/THS.2017.7943468","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7943468","","Law enforcement;Sorting;Data visualization;Visual analytics;Measurement;Tools","","1","","17","IEEE","8 Jun 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Recent works on machine learning have shown impressive results in generating new examples of images using Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN). Creating synthetic facial images that resembles a group, but no one in particular seem an interesting strategy to anonymize a face. Nevertheless, the image synthesis process is computationally expensive and requires a very large training dataset to produce a human-acceptable outcome. This paper presents an investigation on the trade-off between the required number of instances (size) and the images’ inter-variability of a training set for using Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) to generate human-acceptable synthetic images. We report an experiment using the Appen crowdsourcing platform to evaluate the human acceptance of the synthetic images generated by our DCGAN trained using different samples of the CelebA public dataset, taken according to facial attributes, such as cheekbones protuberance, face shape and eyebrow thickness. The results indicate that (1) Facial attributes have a significant effect on diminishing the images’ inter-variability, specially face shape; (2) smaller images’ inter-variability leads to smaller required training dataset and (3) filtering the DCGAN’s training datasets using oval face shape led to a required dataset almost 50% lesser than without filtering for generating images humanly acceptable. We believe this result may help individuals to anonymize their visual data maintaining certain characteristics but keeping their privacy at a lower computational cost.","2577-1655","978-1-6654-4207-7","10.1109/SMC52423.2021.9659033","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9659033","","Training;Crowdsourcing;Data privacy;Visualization;Filtering;Shape;Image synthesis","","1","","31","IEEE","6 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Before debris can be removed, they must be located and identified, a tedious and time-consuming process. Automatic target recognition algorithms speed up this process by searching vast swaths of survey data to locate anomalies that could be debris. However, these targets must still be manually evaluated by analysts. We present a tool that increases analysts' efficiency by automating most of the interaction steps involved in marine debris evaluation. It automatically generates and displays multiple optimal views, which can remove the need for analysts to manually reposition their viewpoint. We also applied these optimal views to a web-based crowdsourcing application, which tested whether the general public could assist in marine debris evaluation. Our results showed that, even though the participants were untrained, their collective decisions were generally in agreement and reliable enough to greatly reduce the number of marine debris targets that must be evaluated by the limited pool of trained analysts.

Finally, high individual adaptability can help employees achieve better task performance. The research model is tested using data collected from 210 Chinese knowledge workers who have led or participated in a crowdsourcing project at least once. The empirical results reveal that social connection activities play a positive role in employees' three adaptabilities while entertainment activities play a negative role.

If a user is subject to a tariff-limit, then the results from crowdsourcing might be misleading-effectively providing tariff measurements and not network benchmarks. Hence, detecting whether a tariff is the limiting factor in one specific broadband measurement is crucial to ensure that such crowdsourced approaches are credible. Although machine-learning techniques are promising for this use case, collecting a large number of labeled samples is non-trivial, especially if we aim to cover a wide range of test conditions.In this paper, we use a reference LTE cell, which we can fully control, to conduct automated measurements over a wide range of signal strengths. By carefully engineering different features, we show that this training data set can be separated almost perfectly. We then implement a semi-supervised learning approach based on this feature vector, and use label spreading to classify the validation data set that we collected from several walk tests.Providing unlabeled data increases the accuracy of the classifier to 99%, thus helping to bridge the gap between lab-data and real-world tests. This shows that automated measurements collected from a reference cell under lab conditions are - when combined with unlabeled outdoor data - a sufficient basis for a robust and accurate tariff limit detection scheme.","2577-2465","978-1-7281-5207-3","10.1109/VTC2020-Spring48590.2020.9129111","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9129111","Semi-supervised;machine learning;label spreading;label propagation;RMBT;LTE;crowdsourcing;tariff-limits;token bucket;measurements;mobile;cellular;networks;operator;benchmarking","Tariffs;Downlink;Throughput;Benchmark testing;Interference;Long Term Evolution;Crowdsourcing","","1","","18","IEEE","30 Jun 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this work, we instead argue for online selection to localize such transmitters. Online selection can lead to more accurate localization using limited number of sensors, as compared to selecting sensors a priori, albeit at the cost of higher latency. To account for the trade-off between accuracy and latency, we add a constraint on the number of selection rounds. For the case where the number of rounds is equal to the number of selected sensors, we propose a heuristic based on Thompson Sampling and show using trace-driven simulation that it provides 23 % better accuracy compared to a number of proposed baseline algorithms. For restricted number of rounds, we show that using conventional parallel version of the modified Thompson Sampling which selects equal number of sensors in each round results in a substantial reduction in accuracy. To this end, we propose a strategy of selecting decreasing number of sensors in subsequent rounds of the modified Parallel Thompson Sampling. Our evaluation shows that the proposed heuristic leads to only 3 % reduction in accuracy in contrast to 22 % using modified Parallel Thompson Sampling, when we select 50 sensors in 20 rounds.","2155-2509","978-1-6654-2104-1","10.1109/COMSNETS53615.2022.9668385","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9668385","","Location awareness;Radio frequency;High-temperature superconductors;Costs;Limiting;Transmitters;Heuristic algorithms","","1","","32","IEEE","13 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The majority of research in this domain can be categorized as ‘reactive’ spatial prediction, where the predictions are made based on a small set of measurements from an active transmitter whose radio environment is to be predicted. Emerging spectrum-sharing paradigms would benefit from ‘proactive’ spatial prediction of the radio environment, where the spatial predictions must be done for a transmitter for which no measurement has been collected. This paper proposes a novel, supervised deep learning-based framework, ProSpire, that enables spectrum sharing by leveraging the idea of proactive spatial prediction. We carefully address several challenges in ProSpire, such as designing a framework that conveniently collects training data for learning, performing the predictions in a fast manner, enabling operations without an area map, and ensuring that the predictions do not lead to undesired interference. ProSpire relies on the crowdsourcing of transmitters and receivers during their normal operations to address some of the aforementioned challenges. The core component of ProSpire is a deep learning-based image-to-image translation method, which we call RSSu-net. We generate several diverse datasets using ray tracing software and numerically evaluate ProSpire. Our evaluations show that RSSu-net performs reasonably well in terms of signal strength prediction, $\approx$ 5dB mean absolute error, which is comparable to the average error of other relevant methods. Importantly, due to the merits of RSSu-net, ProSpire creates proactive boundaries around transmitters such that they can be activated with $\approx$ 97% probability of not causing interference. In this regard, the performance of RSSu-net is 19% better than that of other comparable methods.","2155-5494","979-8-3503-0052-9","10.1109/SECON58729.2023.10287479","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10287479","Spatial Prediction;Deep Learning","Deep learning;Wireless networks;Radio transmitters;Training data;Interference;Receivers;Ray tracing","","1","","18","IEEE","23 Oct 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Thus, the current editing approaches sow confusion and ambiguity to knowledge representation, and cause problems to a wide-range of downstream technologies. In this paper, we present an approach that resolves these problems by differentiating the main-article from the sub-articles that are not at the core of entity representations. We propose a hybrid neural article model that learns on two facets of a Wikipedia article: (i) Two neural document encoders capture the latent semantic features from the article title and text contents. (ii) A set of explicit features measure and characterize the symbolic and structural aspects of each article. In this study, we use crowdsourcing to create a large annotated dataset for feature extraction, and for evaluating a variety of encoding techniques and learning structures. The optimized model so derived identifies main articles with near-perfect precision and recall, and outperforms various baselines on the contributed dataset.","","978-1-7281-0858-2","10.1109/BigData47090.2019.9005578","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9005578","","Encyclopedias;Electronic publishing;Internet;Semantics;Feature extraction;Logic gates","","1","","46","IEEE","24 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Such problem becomes quite challenging when we do not initially know neither workers' abilities, nor questions' difficulties (besides common a priori statistics), nor (of course) which is the correct answer. Indeed, such problem requires to jointly learn workers' abilities and questions' difficulties, while adaptively assigning questions to the most appropriate workers so as to maximize our chances to find which are the correct answers. To address such problem, we first cast it into a suitably constructed Bayesian framework which permits us to obtain an analytically tractable (closed form) single-question inference step, and then we address the more general framework via the Expectation Propagation algorithm, an approximated message-passing iterative technique. We then exploit the information gathered by the inference framework as adaptive weights for a maximum weight matching task assignment policy, proposing a computationally efficient algorithm which maximizes the entropy reduction for the questions assigned at each step.","","978-1-5090-4260-9","10.1109/ISNCC.2017.8072005","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8072005","","Crowdsourcing;Random variables;Inference algorithms;Entropy;Resource management;Adaptation models","","1","","21","IEEE","19 Oct 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Although existing works manage to design incentive mechanisms in data trading for IoV, they fail to address the trust problem. The blockchain technology has been widely studied to establish trust among participants, however, little is currently known about the perishability in the data market, which leads to the failure in explaining the price difference of digital goods. In this paper, we propose a perishability-oriented pricing mechanism to support perishable digital goods trading among IoVs.

Although, there are many approaches for detecting cyberbullying they still need to be improved upon for more accurate detection. We need new approaches that understand the context of the words used in cyberbullying by generating different representations of each word. In addition. there is a large amount of unlabelled data on the Internet that needs to be labelled for a more accurate detection process. Even though multiple methods for annotating datasets exists, the most widely used are still manual approaches, either using experts or crowdsourcing. However, The time needed and high cost of labor for manually annotation approaches result in a lack of annotated social network datasets for training a robust cyberbullying detector. Automated approaches can be relied upon in labelling data, such as using the Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) model. In this paper, we proposed two main parts. The first part is proposing a model of parallel BERT + Bi-LSTM used for detecting cyberbullying terms. The second part is utilizing Contrastive Self-Supervised Learning (a form of SSL) to augment the training set from unlabeled data using a small portion of another manually annotated dataset.

These interpretations could be influenced by many factors such as annotator mood and previously seen examples. In this work, we examine two hypotheses of order-dependent biases in sequential labeling tasks: negatively auto-correlated sequential decision making and positively auto-correlated affective priming. Using controlled generation of facial expressions, we find that i) annotators achieve higher agreement when presented examples in the same sequential order, ii) the valence label of the current image positively correlates with the previous labels given. While we also observe a positive correlation between labels and the number of preceding positive and negative images seen, this correlation is highly dependent on example ordering.

In vivo design means that the study participant has to rate the QoE of a video that is embedded in an application similar to a real streaming service, e.g., YouTube or Netflix. In vitro design refers to a setting, in which the video stream is separated from a specific service and thus, the video plays on a plain background. Although these designs vary widely, the results are often compared and generalized.Therefore, in this work, we investigate the influence of these two study design alternatives on the perceived QoE. In crowdsourced user studies, participants rate the video streaming with respect to different stalling patterns (no stalling, different positions) and study designs (in vivo or in vitro). Contrary to our expectations, the results indicate that there is statistically no significant influence of the study design on the perceived video QoE and acceptance.

Wikis play an important role in this scenario because they allow content creation and shared edition of contributions. Nevertheless, none of the wikis we are aware of facilitates the geographical annotation of content, even when location is important metadata when talking about social development. This work focuses on the enrichment of an open source wiki for making it possible to manage the geographical metadata of contributions. Social knowledge harvesting in a medium-sized community in Ecuador was used as a case study for evaluating the proposal. The experiment took place during one month with the participation of 63 young citizens. A total of 57 wiki pages were created and 118 editions were made. The amount of information retrieved by the community is greater than the volume contained in the 18 contributions found in Wikipedia.

Thus, we propose a real-time method for constructing a local word database which consistently keeps the local words and their locations up to date by iteratively adding new local words, removing old temporary local words, and updating the locations indicated by the local words. These functions are realized by adaptively recording/resetting the usage history of each word to properly examine its spatial locality and by assigning the weight for each geotag which is used to represent the locations indicated by the local words according to their temporal variations. The local word database constructed by our proposed method was verified to contain more up-todate local words and locations compared to other types of geographical dictionary constructed by experts, crowdsourcing, and from the geotagged tweets accumulated for a fixed period of time based on the performance evaluations of tweet location estimation as an example of applications utilizing the geographical dictionaries.","","978-1-5090-1893-2","10.1109/SmartCity.2015.88","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7463742","Twitter;LocalWord;Iterative Database Construction;Text-Based Location Estimation","History;Databases;Media;Twitter;Dictionaries;Real-time systems;Estimation","","1","","10","IEEE","5 May 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To address this problem, crowdsourcing has emerged as a popular, inexpensive, and efficient data mining solution for performing distributed label collection. However, crowdsourced annotations are inherently untrustworthy, as the labels are provided by anonymous volunteers who may have varying, unreliable expertise. Worse yet, some participants on commonly used platforms such as Amazon Mechanical Turk may be adversarial, and provide intentionally incorrect label information without the end user's knowledge. We discuss three conventional models of the label generation process, describing their parameterizations and the model-based approaches used to solve them. We then propose OpinionRank, a model-free, interpretable, graph-based spectral algorithm for integrating crowdsourced annotations into reliable labels for performing supervised or semi-supervised learning. Our experiments show that OpinionRank performs favorably when compared against more highly parameterized algorithms. We also show that OpinionRank is scalable to very large datasets and numbers of label sources, and requires considerably fewer computational resources than previous approaches.","2161-4407","978-1-6654-3900-8","10.1109/IJCNN52387.2021.9533320","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9533320","Unreliable experts;graph-based ranking;spectral methods;ensemble voting systems;crowdsourcing","Crowdsourcing;Annotations;Neural networks;Machine learning;Semisupervised learning;Reliability;Data mining","","1","","44","IEEE","20 Sep 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Processing massive data calls for new data structures and algorithms different from traditional ones designed for small-scale problems. For measurement from networked distributed systems, we consider an essential data format: signals on graphs. Due to limited computing resources, the sensor nodes in the distributed systems may outsource the computing tasks to third parties, such as cloud platforms, arising a severe concern on data privacy. A de-facto solution is to have third parties only process encrypted data. We propose a novel and efficient privacy-preserving secure outsourced computation protocol for denoising signals on the graph based on the information-theoretic secure multi-party computation (ITS-MPC). Denoising the data makes paths for further meaningful data processing.

Yet such platforms myopically recommend the currently shortest path to users, and selfish users are unwilling to travel to longer paths of varying traffic conditions to explore. Prior studies focus on one-shot congestion games without information learning, while our work studies how users learn and alter traffic conditions on stochastic paths in a distributed manner. Our analysis shows that, as compared to the social optimum in minimizing the long-term social cost via optimal exploration-exploitation tradeoff, the myopic routing policy leads to severe under-exploration of stochastic paths with the price of anarchy (PoA) greater than 2. Besides, it fails to ensure the correct learning convergence about users' traffic hazard beliefs. To mitigate the efficiency loss, we first show that existing information-hiding mechanisms and deterministic path-recommendation mechanisms in Bayesian persuasion literature do not work with even $\mathbf{PoA}=\infty$. Accordingly, we propose a new combined hiding and probabilistic recommendation (CHAR) mechanism to hide all information from a selected user group and provide state-dependent probabilistic recommendations to the other user group. Our CHAR successfully ensures PoA less than $\frac{5}{4}$, which cannot be further reduced by any other informational mechanism. Additionally, we experiment with real-world data to verify our CHAR's good average performance.","2157-8117","979-8-3503-8284-6","10.1109/ISIT57864.2024.10619271","Ministry of Education, Singapore(grant numbers:MOE-T2EP20121-0001); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10619271","","Photography;Crowdsourcing;Web services;Distance learning;Games;Probabilistic logic;Routing","","1","","38","IEEE","19 Aug 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To address this issue, pseudo-labeling based weakly supervised text classification models have attracted significant attention. However, prior works on weakly-supervised classification usually assume that each unlabeled sample belongs to one and only one of the target classes. Such an assumption may not be appropriate or realistic for open set scenarios where the unlabeled data are obtained via a coarse collection process like crowdsourcing. This paper studies weakly-supervised text classification under the open set scenarios, relaxing such a closed set assumption and allowing for out-of-label-space data. We propose a simple combination framework of multiple existing techniques called OSP-Class, an Open Set Pseudo-labeling with noise robust training for text Classification, which is designed to generate a category-specific denoising model that can remove text corpus containing unknown data by jointly combining (1) category vocabulary expansion with pre-trained BERT masked language model, (2) binary pseudo-labeling with weighted random oversampling, and (3) noise robust training with NCE+MAE loss function. Our model achieves the highest F1 score with an average of 92.49% in the open set environment. We demonstrate that the proposed method is comparable and slightly improved performance with some minor settings even if it does not use fundamentally innovative or different techniques.","","978-1-6654-8045-1","10.1109/BigData55660.2022.10020273","Ministry of Education; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10020273","Weakly supervised learning;text classification;Pseudo-labeling;Open set environment;Noise robustness","Training;Vocabulary;Text categorization;Supervised learning;Training data;Big Data;Data models","","1","","35","IEEE","26 Jan 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Currently, crowdsourcing is being used for the subjective evaluation of synthesized voice. In this case, it is important to remove workers who do not satisfy the requester's requirements, but effective worker filtering criteria remain unexplored. In this study, we focused on sound quality evaluation and explored effective worker filtering criteria for subjective evaluation of synthesized voice. To filter workers who can evaluate sound quality, we designed a task that compares pairs of synthesized voices with different amounts of distortion and selects less distorted voices. In this task, some pairs included obviously distorted voices to measure the degree of attention to distortion in the evaluation of each worker. The following three criteria for worker filtering were defined: whether the evaluation focused on the amount of distortion (Understanding of Requester's Intent), whether the evaluation was consistent (Response Consistency Rate), and whether the evaluation was made with confidence (Response Confidence). We conducted an experiment to explore the effects of these criteria on the sound quality evaluation results on Amazon Mechanical Turk. Our experimental results implied that the measures of Understanding of Requester's Intent and Response Confidence for pairs containing obviously distorted voices were effective in identifying workers who did not respond seriously and who did not understand the intent of the experiment.","2640-0103","978-616-590-477-3","10.23919/APSIPAASC55919.2022.9979812","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9979812","","Crowdsourcing;Filtering;Information processing;Distortion;Distortion measurement;Speech synthesis;Task analysis","","1","","25","","21 Dec 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We consider a bidding style that is quite common in practical mobile phone sensing applications but has not been studied in existing work on mobile phone sensing mechanism design. We show how the job owner could properly select users and reduce her total payment at the same time even when users could submit fake costs.","","978-1-4673-7183-4","10.1109/BDCloud.2015.55","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7310759","Crowdsourcing;mobile sensing;incentive;mechanism design","Sensors;Mobile handsets;Mobile communication;Optimization;Monitoring;Algorithm design and analysis;Crowdsourcing","","1","","18","IEEE","29 Oct 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

First, make observations about the behavior of the different image-based and non-image-based visibility models across different weather conditions during daytime at airfields where a traditional weather sensor is collocated with an aviation weather-camera installation and on-staff expert human weather-observers. Second, survey the viability of deriving ground visibility from Alaska's weather camera network via crowdsourcing in applied settings. The models' behavior was examined using daily time-series plots.

Their proliferation has led to the emergence of crowdsensing/crowdsourcing services, where humans collect data about their environment (using phones), and servers aggregate the data for various application purposes of interest. With the emergence of social media, a common alternative form of human data entry has become media posts (e.g., on Twitter). This leads to the prospect of building crowdsensing services on top of social media content, exploiting humans as ``sensors"". In this paper, we develop one such service, called {\em StoryLine}. The service detects and tracks physical urban events of interest to the user, such as car accidents, infrastructure damage (in the aftermath of a natural disaster), or instances of civil unrest. It offers an interface to client-side software that allows browsing such events in real time, as well as an interface for software applications to a structured representation of the events and their related statistics. The service embodies novel algorithms for real-time detection, demultiplexing, and tracking of physical events using social media data. In our evaluation with Twitter feeds, we show that our service outperforms two state-of-the-art baselines in event detection and demultiplexing. We also conduct two case-studies to show the effectiveness of the real-time event detection capability and event tracking performance of our system.","","978-1-4503-4966-6","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7946865","Social Sensing;Event Tracking","Accidents;Demultiplexing;Sensors;Social network services;Automobiles;Real-time systems;Event detection","","1","","43","","15 Jun 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Here we propose a parity response model: the worker is asked to check whether the number of objects having a given attribute in the chosen subset is even or odd. A worker either responds with a correct binary answer or declines to respond. We propose a method for designing the sequence of subsets of objects to be queried so that the attributes of the objects can be identified with high probability using few (n) answers. The method is based on an analogy to the design of Fountain codes for erasure channels. We define the query difficulty d̅ as the average size of the query subsets and we define the sample complexity n as the minimum number of collected answers required to attain a given recovery accuracy. We obtain fundamental tradeoffs between recovery accuracy, query difficulty, and sample complexity. In particular, the necessary and sufficient sample complexity required for recovering all k attributes with high probability is n = c0 max{k, (k log k)/ d̅} and the sample complexity for recovering a fixed proportion (1 - δ)k of the attributes for δ = o(1) is n = c1 max{k, (klog(1/δ))/ d̅}, where c0, c1 > 0.","","978-1-5386-6596-1","10.1109/ALLERTON.2018.8636012","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8636012","","Complexity theory;Crowdsourcing;Databases;Channel coding;Capacity planning;Object recognition","","1","","10","IEEE","7 Feb 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These activities typically involve sequences of interactions between humans and objects across different locations and times within a household. Identifying these events and understanding their temporal and spatial relationships is crucial for accurately modeling human behavior patterns. However, most current methods and datasets for human activity recognition focus on identifying singular events at specific moments and locations, neglecting the complexity of activities that span multiple times and places. To address this gap, we collected data on human activity patterns over a single day through crowdsourcing. Based on this, we introduce a novel synthetic video question-answering dataset. Our proposed dataset includes videos of daily activities accompanied by question-answer pairs that require models to reason about sequences of activities in both time and space. We evaluated state-of-the-art methods against our dataset, highlighting their limitations in handling the intricate spatio-temporal dynamics of human activity sequences. To improve upon these methods, we propose a two-stage model. The proposed model initially decodes the detailed content of individual videos using a transformer-based approach, then employs LLMs for advanced spatio-temporal reasoning across multiple videos. We hope our research provides valuable benchmarks and insights, paving the way for advancements in the recognition of daily human activity patterns.","2153-0866","979-8-3503-7770-5","10.1109/IROS58592.2024.10802775","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10802775","","Adaptation models;Three-dimensional displays;Benchmark testing;Predictive models;Transformers;Pattern recognition;Complexity theory;Indoor environment;Medical diagnosis;Intelligent robots","","","","34","IEEE","25 Dec 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Therefore, we propose a new Psychology-inspired approach for SEC that includes identification of actions via human listeners. To achieve this goal, we used crowdsourcing to have listeners identify 20 actions that in isolation or in combination may have produced any of the 50 sound events in the well-studied dataset ESC-50. The resulting annotations for each audio recording relate actions to a database of sound events for the first time. The annotations were used to create semantic representations called Action Vectors (AVs). We evaluated SEC by comparing the AVs with two types of audio features - log-mel spectrograms and state-of-the-art audio embeddings.

Despite the effectiveness of existing GNN-based Active Learning (AL) methods, they assume that the annotated labels are always correct, which is contradictory to the error-prone labeling process in a practical crowdsourcing environment. Besides, due to this impractical assumption, existing works only focus on optimizing the node selection in AL but neglect optimizing the labeling process. Therefore, we present NC-ALG, the first GNN-based AL framework that optimizes both the node selection and node labeling process under a noisy crowd. For node selection, NC-ALG introduces a new measurement to model influence reliability and an effective influence maximization objective to select nodes. For node labeling, NC-ALG significantly reduces the labeling cost by considering the model-predicted labels and the labels of mirror nodes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to consider GNN-based AL under the practical noisy crowd. Empirical studies on public datasets demonstrate that NC-ALG significantly outperforms existing methods in terms labeling efficiency. Notably, it only takes NC-ALG one-third of the labeling budget that the competitive baseline GRAIN needs to achieve an accuracy of 70.7 % on PubMed.","2375-026X","979-8-3503-1715-2","10.1109/ICDE60146.2024.00210","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:U22B2037,U23B2048); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10597796","Graph Neural Networks;Active Learning;Crowdsourcing Environment","Crowdsourcing;Costs;Noise;Predictive models;Graph neural networks;Labeling;Noise measurement","","","","59","IEEE","23 Jul 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Those low-quality images may disturb the performance of reconstruction. To avoid low-quality images and lead participants to collect high-quality data, we take images quality into account when allocating rewards. The rewards of participants should be proportionable with their contribution. In this paper, we propose a pricing mechanism, called ImgPricing, to determine the reward of participants in 3D reconstruction system.

ImgPricing differs from traditional pricing schemes, such as Shapley value, as it introduces the image sequence as an indispensable factor.

Finalised documents are pushed to a repository for exploration via geographic maps or text searching, and can then be downloaded in various formats for re-use.

Importantly, this crowdsourcing of the learning process allows the system to continue functioning even if some nodes are affected or disconnected. In a disaster scenario, communication infrastructure and centralized systems may be disrupted or completely unavailable, hindering the possibility of carrying out standard centralized learning tasks in these settings. Thus, fully decentralized learning can help in this case. However, transitioning from centralized to peer-to-peer communications introduces a dependency between the learning process and the topology of the communication graph among nodes. In a disaster scenario, even peer-to-peer communications are susceptible to abrupt changes, such as devices running out of battery or getting disconnected from others due to their position. In this study, we investigate the effects of various disruptions to peer-to-peer communications on decentralized learning in a disaster setting. We examine the resilience of a decentralized learning process when a subset of devices drop from the process abruptly. To this end, we analyze the difference between losing devices holding data, i.e., potential knowledge, vs. devices contributing only to the graph connectivity, i.e., with no data. Our findings on a Barabasi-Albert graph topology, where training data is distributed across nodes in an IID fashion, indicate that the accuracy of the learning process is more affected by a loss of connectivity than by a loss of data. Nevertheless, the network remains relatively robust, and the learning process can achieve a good level of accuracy.","2643-6868","979-8-3503-1951-4","10.1109/ICT-DM58371.2023.10286953","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10286953","Decentralised learning;robustness;scale-free networks;P2P","Bridges;Network topology;Training data;Switches;Robustness;Peer-to-peer computing;Topology","","","","12","IEEE","24 Oct 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we propose an efficient algorithm that overcomes the technical shortcomings of the state-of-the-art and achieves square root regret, queue length, and feedback delay. Our approach also accommodates additional constraints, such as quality of service, fairness, and budgeted cost constraints, with constant expected peak violation and zero expected violation after a fixed timeslot. Empirically, our algorithm’s regret is competitive with the state-of-the-art for some problem instances and outperforms it in others, with much lower delay and constraint violation.","2641-9874","979-8-3503-8350-8","10.1109/INFOCOM52122.2024.10621295","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10621295","","Crowdsourcing;Costs;Simulation;Spread spectrum communication;Quality of service;Routing;Dispatching","","","","37","IEEE","12 Aug 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Human flesh search (HFS) is called ""cyber manhunt"" or ""cyber crowdsourcing"". It has autonomous and collective nature and action. Many scholars proclaimed that HFS is considered as a unique online phenomenon in the Greater China region. A promising female writer committed suicide due to her teacher's sexual assault when she was a teenager, which has provoked an intensive cyber debate and HFS in Taiwan. HFS worked like police-netizens, tracked down the perpetrator, and pushed the lawmakers to institute legal mechanism. The implications for interdisciplinary collaborations were reviewed.","","978-9-8695-3171-9","10.23919/PNC.2018.8579469","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8579469","human flesh search (HFS);sexual assault;Taiwan;Greater China region;netizens;global adult educators","","","","","55","","16 Dec 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper explores a hybrid crowd-AI approach to develop white-box ML models associated with human-interpretable symbolic rules. The key idea of the proposed method is to discover human-interpretable latent features from trained neural networks by leveraging human abductive reasoning. The proposed method automatically generates crowdsourcing tasks that display subsets of images corresponding to each latent feature and ask crowd workers to provide the semantics of the features in natural language. The obtained semantics allow us to use the latent features as human-interpretable predicates that form symbolic rules to define target classes. We provide experimental results showing that the proposed approach can obtain interpretable symbolic rules and explanations.","2472-0070","979-8-3503-2422-8","10.1109/IIAI-AAI59060.2023.00060","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10371633","XAI;Human-in-the-loop;Image Classification","Semantics;Natural languages;Neurons;Cognition;Data mining;Task analysis;Informatics","","","","23","IEEE","29 Dec 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We can acquire the geo-coordinates of some of these facades either through crowdsourcing or exploring their metadata. Using these ""seed"" buildings and through spatial reasoning within and across the historical pictures, in this paper, we show how we infer the geolocation of the other facades. We propose a probabilistic inference approach that first constructs a graph with facades as nodes and their spatial distances as edges, and then through probabilistic inference on this graph, geolocates the facades. Our experiments show that with 10% of the building geolocated as seed buildings, we can quite accurately geolocate the rest of the buildings in our dataset.","","978-1-7281-6251-5","10.1109/BigData50022.2020.9378093","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9378093","Geospatial;Geolocate;Spatial Reasoning;Probabilistic Inference;Belief Propagation","Crowdsourcing;Three-dimensional displays;Geology;Buildings;Urban areas;Big Data;Probabilistic logic","","","","10","IEEE","19 Mar 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
