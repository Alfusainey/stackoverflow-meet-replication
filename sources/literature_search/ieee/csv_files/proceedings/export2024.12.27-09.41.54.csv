As is the case with other vision tasks, machine learning is a promising approach to understanding shading - but there is little ground truth shading data available for real-world images. We introduce Shading Annotations in the Wild (SAW), a new large-scale, public dataset of shading annotations in indoor scenes, comprised of multiple forms of shading judgments obtained via crowdsourcing, along with shading annotations automatically generated from RGB-D imagery. We use this data to train a convolutional neural network to predict per-pixel shading information in an image.

We aim to bridge this gap by proposing a system for automatic recognition of students engagement levels during e-learning sessions, using a crowdsourced discriminative learning approach. The key contributions of this work include a custom dataset for engagement recognition that will be made publicly available with corresponding crowdsourced non-aggregated labels, as well as a novel instance-weighted Multiple Kernel Learning SVM method that can directly consider vote distributions from crowdsourcing platforms in the learning methodology.

"Trojaning Language Models for Fun and Profit","X. Zhang; Z. Zhang; S. Ji; T.

This paradigm shift significantly simplifies the system development cycles. However, as many LMs are provided by untrusted third parties, their lack of standardization or regulation entails profound security implications, which are largely unexplored. To bridge this gap, this work studies the security threats posed by malicious LMs to NLP systems. Specifically, we present TrojanLM, a new class of trojaning attacks in which maliciously crafted LMs trigger host NLP systems to malfunction in a highly predictable manner. By empirically studying three state-of-the-art LMs (BERT, GPT-2, XLNet) in a range of security-critical NLP tasks (toxic comment detection, question answering, text completion) as well as user studies on crowdsourcing platforms, we demonstrate that TrojanLM possesses the following properties: (i) flexibility - the adversary is able to flexibly define logical combinations (e.g., ‘and’, ‘or’, ‘xor’) of arbitrary words as triggers, (ii) efficacy - the host systems misbehave as desired by the adversary with high probability when “trigger” -embedded inputs are present, (iii) specificity - the trojan LMs function indistinguishably from their benign counterparts on clean inputs, and (iv) fluency - the trigger-embedded inputs appear as fluent natural language and highly relevant to their surrounding contexts. We provide analytical justification for the practicality of TrojanLM, and further discuss potential countermeasures and their challenges, which lead to several promising research directions.","","978-1-6654-1491-3","10.1109/EuroSP51992.2021.00022","National Science Foundation(grant numbers:1951729,1953813,1953893); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9581257","","Crowdsourcing;Bridges;Buildings;Standardization;Knowledge discovery;Natural language processing;Regulation","","39","","61","IEEE","4 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Although recent crowdsourcing based work has started to address the issue, incentives are still lacking for wide user adoption. Thus the progress to ubiquitous localization remains slow. In this paper, we explore an alternative approach that leverages environmental physical features such as store logos or wall posters. A user uses a smartphone to obtain relative position measurements to such static reference points for the system to triangulate the user location. We study the principle of such localization, determine the suitable sensor, and devise guidelines for the user to choose reference points for better accuracy. To enable fast deployment, we propose a lightweight site survey method for service providers to quickly estimate the coordinates of reference points. We incorporate and enhance image matching algorithms with a heuristic technique to automatically identify chosen reference points at high accuracy. Extensive experiments have shown that the prototype achieves 4-5m accuracy at 80-percentile, comparable to the industry state-of-the-art, while covering a 150×75m mall and 300×200m train station requires a one time investment of only 2-3 man-hours from service providers.","0743-166X","978-1-4799-3360-0","10.1109/INFOCOM.2014.6847924","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6847924","","Accuracy;Gyroscopes;Compass;Position measurement;Conferences;Computers;IEEE 802.11 Standards","","38","1","22","IEEE","8 Jul 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

With the wide use of smartphones and their ubiquitous easy access to the Internet, sharing and uploading images to the cloud via smartphones offer a nontrivial opportunity to provide information of disaster zones. However, due to limited available bandwidth and energy, smartphone-based crowdsourcing fails to support the real-time data analytics. The key to efficiently and timely share and analyze the images is to determine the value/worth of the images based on their significance and redundancy, and only upload those valuable and unique images. In this paper, we propose a near-realtime and cost-efficient scheme, called SmartEye, in the cloud-assisted disaster environment. The idea behind SmartEye is to implement QoS-aware in-network deduplication over DiffServ in the software-defined networks (SDN). Due to the ease of use, simplicity and scalability, DiffServ supports the in-network deduplication to meet the needs of differentiated QoS. SmartEye aggregates the flows with similar features via a semantic hashing, and provides communication services for the aggregated, not a single, flow. To achieve these goals, we leverage two main optimization schemes, including semantic hashing and space-efficient filters. Efficient image sharing is helpful to disaster detection and scene recognition. To demonstrate the feasibility of SmartEye, we conduct two real-world case studies in which the loss in Typhoon Haiyan (2013) and Hurricane Sandy (2012) can be identified in a timely fashion by analyzing massive data consisting of more than 22 million images using our SmartEye system. Extensive experimental results illustrate that SmartEye is efficient and effective to achieve real-time analytics in disasters.","0743-166X","978-1-4799-8381-0","10.1109/INFOCOM.2015.7218541","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7218541","","Servers;Feature extraction;Bandwidth;Diffserv networks;Smart phones;Quality of service;Computers","","37","","30","IEEE","24 Aug 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Classification of data, which involve images, is complex and also time consuming. The present state of art of machine learning techniques can be harnessed to atomize the classification of images. The advent of high processing computing resources, state of art machine learning and deep learning algorithms provide tangible solutions.

In contrast to fake news which intend to deceive and manipulate the reader, satirical stories are designed to entertain the reader by ridiculing or criticizing a social figure. Due to its serious threats of misleading information, researchers, governments, journalists and fact-checking volunteers are working together to address the fake news issue and increase the accountability of digital media. The automatic fake news detection systems enable identification of deceptive news. Low accuracy remains the main drawback of these systems. The automatic detection using only news' content is a technically challenging task as the language used in these articles is made to bypass the fake news detectors. This becomes even more complicated when the task is to differentiate the satirical stories from fake news. On the other side, human cognitive skills have shown to overperform machine-based systems when it comes to such tasks. In this paper, we address the fake news and satire detection by proposing a method that uses a hybrid machine-crowd approach for detection of potentially deceptive news. This system combines the human factor with the machine learning approach and a decision-making model that estimates the classification confidence of algorithms and decides whether the task needs human input or not. Our approach achieves reasonably higher accuracy compared to the reported baseline results, in exchange of cost and latency of using the crowdsourcing service.","","978-1-5386-9502-9","10.1109/CIC.2018.00048","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8537846","fake news, satire, machine learning, crowdsourcing, hybrid machine-crowd systems","Task analysis;Feature extraction;Social network services;Media;Machine learning;Crowdsourcing;History","","35","","29","IEEE","18 Nov 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Nazr-CNN consists of two components. The function of the first component is to localize objects (e.g. houses or infrastructure) in an image by carrying out a pixel-level classification. In the second component, a hidden layer of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is used to encode Fisher Vectors (FV) of the segments generated from the first component in order to help discriminate between different levels of damage. To showcase our approach we use data from UAVs that were deployed to assess the level of damage in the aftermath of a devastating cyclone that hit the island of Vanuatu in 2015. The collected images were labeled by a crowdsourcing effort and the labeling categories consisted of fine-grained levels of damage to built structures. Since our data set is relatively small, a pre-trained network for pixel-level classification and FV encoding was used. Nazr-CNN attains promising results both for object detection and damage assessment suggesting that the integrated pipeline is robust in the face of small data sets and labeling errors by annotators. While the focus of Nazr-CNN is on assessment of UAV images in a post-disaster scenario, our solution is general and can be applied in many diverse settings. We show one such case of transfer learning to assess the level of damage in aerial images collected after a typhoon in Philippines.","","978-1-5090-5004-8","10.1109/DSAA.2017.72","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8259763","deep learning;fine-grained classification;damage assessment;unmanned aerial vehicle","Image segmentation;Feature extraction;Pipelines;Unmanned aerial vehicles;Encoding;Semantics","","31","","47","IEEE","18 Jan 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

At the core of SemSense are different modules for handling incorrect location estimates, fake check-ins, as well as increasing the coverage of indoor venues by means of a novel category inference technique. Our experimental evaluation of SemSense using different Android phones in four malls in two cities shows that it can achieve a high semantic labeling accuracy of 87% using a relatively small number of check-ins at each venue in the presence of up to 50% erroneous check-ins.

To overcome these limitations, Paired Comparison (PC) tests have been proposed as an alternative and are expected to yield more reliable results. However, PC tests can be expensive and time consuming, since for n images they require (n2)comparisons. We present a hybrid subjective test which combines MOS and PC tests via a unified probabilistic model and an active sampling method. The proposed method actively constructs a set of queries consisting of MOS and PC tests based on the expected information gain provided by each test and can effectively reduce the number of tests required for achieving a target accuracy.

However, such protection is usually achieved with significantly degraded learning results. We have observed that the fundamental cause of this problem is that the relationship between model utility and data privacy is not accurately characterized, leading to privacy constraints that are overly strict. In this paper, we address this problem from an optimization perspective, and formulate the problem as one that minimizes the accuracy loss given a set of privacy constraints. We use sensitivity to describe the impact of perturbation noise to the model utility, and propose a new optimized additive noise mechanism that improves overall learning accuracy while conforming to individual privacy constraints. As a highlight of our privacy mechanism, it is highly robust in the high privacy regime (when ∈ → 0), and against any changes in the model structure and experimental settings.","2641-9874","978-1-7281-0515-4","10.1109/INFOCOM.2019.8737494","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8737494","crowdsourcing;data mining;differential privacy;deep learning;optimization","Privacy;Differential privacy;Perturbation methods;Cost function;Additive noise;Training","","27","","22","IEEE","17 Jun 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The design of PAGAN overcomes the accessibility limitations of existing annotation tools, which often require advanced technical skills or even the on-site involvement of the researcher. Such limitations often yield affective corpora that are restricted in size, scope and use, as the applicability of modern data-demanding machine learning methods is rather limited.

However, it suffers from an inherent problem that the localization accuracy declines sharply over time due to the dynamic environment and unstable WiFi devices. Researchers have designed many methods to update the localization model, e.g., crowdsourcing-based model updating, in order to maintain the localization accuracy. Unfortunately, they have not taken the privacy into consideration during the updating process. This will lead to a threat that the eavesdroppers could guess the location providers' private information according to the updating model. For the goal of maintaining the localization accuracy without the risk of privacy breaching, we proposed FLoc, a fingerprinting-based indoor localization system which updates the localization model via a federated learning framework. In FLoc, every provider maintains a local localization model in their own device. They will regularly encrypt the updating parameters and share them to a common model server. At the model server, it aggregates the encrypted information of the local models to maintain a general model, which will be sent back to the local devices for next updating iteration. We evaluate FLoc in an APs unknown laboratory corridor. The experiment results show that FLoc has a comparable localization performance. Moreover, it can successfully protect the providers' privacy, since the information transferred is all encrypted.","","978-1-7281-5212-7","10.1109/MSN48538.2019.00033","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9066152","Indoor Localization;Fingerprinting;Federated Learning","Mobile handsets;Privacy;Fingerprint recognition;Servers;Wireless fidelity;Databases;Computational modeling","","23","","17","IEEE","16 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Though aggregating such ordinal data from the population is facilitating plenty of crowdsourcing applications, contributing such data is privacy risky and may reveal sensitive information (e.g. locations, identities) about individuals. This work studies ordinal data aggregation for distribution estimation meanwhile locally preserving individuals' data privacy (such as on their mobile devices). Under ε-geo-indistinguishable constraints, which capture intrinsic dissimilarity between ordinal categories in the framework of differential privacy, we provide an efficient and effective locally private mechanism: Subset Exponential Mechanism (SEM) for ordinal data distribution estimation. The mechanism randomly responds with a fixed-size subset of the categories with calibrated probability assignment. Specially for uniform ordinal data, we propose a circling technique to symmetrically randomizing categories and estimating frequencies of categories, hence the computational/space costs and estimation performance of SEM are further optimized. Besides contributing theoretical error bounds of SEM, we also evaluate the mechanism on extensive scenarios, the evaluation results show that SEM reduces distribution estimation error on average by exp(∊/2) factor over existing private mechanisms.","","978-1-5090-5336-0","10.1109/INFOCOM.2017.8056977","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8056977","","Data privacy;Estimation;Privacy;Data models;Crowdsourcing;Data aggregation;Databases","","21","","36","IEEE","5 Oct 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Secondly, we apply Particle Filter to adjust the possible calculation quantity needed for the location estimation technique. As experimental result, we achieved real-time location estimation within 6~10m. Another important issue for Scene Analysis technique is the high cost of operation of the previous WiFi observation. Accordingly crowdsourcing approach was used, employing as system where some users could contribute and other uses could share. The ideal system is a composition of the Web and mobile terminal. WiFi data observed by mobile terminals is uploaded to a Web server where it is managed and integrated into GMM and large scale operations are carried out on data and calculations. When the lightweight modeled data is downloaded to the mobile-terminal, the mobile terminal then has the ability to carry out real-time location estimation independently.","","978-1-4673-1954-6","10.1109/IPIN.2012.6418943","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6418943","WiFi Localization;Scene Analysis;Gaussian Mixture Model;Particle Filter;Crwodsourcing","Computational modeling;Standards","","21","","20","IEEE","24 Jan 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To obtain annotation of high quality, various aggregation approaches have been developed, which take into account different factors that impact the quality of aggregated answers. However, existing methods generally focus on single-label (multi-class and binary) tasks, and they ignore the inter-correlation between labels, and thus may have compromised quality. In this paper, we introduce a Multi-Label answer aggregation approach based on Joint Matrix Factorization (ML-JMF). ML-JMF selectively and jointly factorizes the sample-label association matrices collected from different annotators into products of individual and shared low-rank matrices. As such, it takes advantage of the robustness of low-rank matrix approximation to noise, and reduces the impact of unreliable annotators by assigning small (zero) weights to their annotation matrices. In addition, it takes advantage of the correlation among labels by leveraging the shared low-rank matrix, and of the similarity between annotators using the individual low-rank matrices to guide the factorization. ML-JMF pursues the low-rank matrices via a unified objective function, and introduces an iterative technique to optimize it. ML-JMF finally uses the optimized low-rank matrices and weights to infer the ground-truth labels. Our experimental results on multi-label datasets show that ML-JMF outperforms competitive methods in inferring ground truth labels. Our approach can identify unreliable annotators, and is robust against their misleading answers through the assignment of small (zero) weights to their annotation.","2374-8486","978-1-5386-9159-5","10.1109/ICDM.2018.00067","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8594876","Crowdsourcing, Multi-Label Learning, Joint Matrix Factorization, Spammers","Task analysis;Correlation;Reliability;Noise measurement;Crowdsourcing;Labeling;Image annotation","","21","","46","IEEE","30 Dec 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

There is currently no consensus on the correct colors for eHMIs. Industry and academia have already proposed a variety of eHMI colors, including red and green, as well as colors that are said to be neutral, such as cyan. A confusion that can arise with red and green is whether the color refers to the pedestrian (egocentric perspective) or the automated vehicle (allocentric perspective). We conducted two crowdsourcing experiments (N = 2000 each) with images depicting an automated vehicle equipped with an eHMI in the form of a rectangular display on the front bumper. The eHMI had one out of 729 colors from the RGB spectrum. In Experiment 1, participants rated the intuitiveness of a random subset of 100 of these eHMIs for signaling `please cross the road', and in Experiment 2 for `please do NOT cross the road'. The results showed that for `please cross', colors close to pure green were considered the most intuitive. For `please do NOT cross', colors close to pure red were rated as the most intuitive, but with high standard deviations among participants. In addition, some participants rated green colors as intuitive for `please do NOT cross'. Results were consistent for men and women and for colorblind and non-colorblind persons. It is concluded that eHMIs should be green if the eHMI is intended to signal `please cross', but green and red should be avoided if the eHMI is intended to signal `please do NOT cross'. Various neutral colors can be used for that purpose, including cyan, yellow, and purple.","2577-1655","978-1-7281-8526-2","10.1109/SMC42975.2020.9282998","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9282998","automated driving;crowdsourcing;external humanmachine interface;color;intuitiveness","Industries;Crowdsourcing;Image color analysis;Roads;Man-machine systems;Standards;Cybernetics","","19","","56","IEEE","14 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Using Codepourri, we developed a novel crowdsourcing workflow where learners who are visiting an educational Web site (www. pythontutor.com) collectively create a tutorial by annotating execution steps in a piece of code and then voting on the best annotations. Since there are far more learners than experts, using learners as a crowd is a potentially more scalable way of creating tutorials.

To assist users to make a right decision as for whether a permission request should be accepted, we propose RecDroid. RecDroid is a crowdsourcing recommendation framework that collects apps' permission requests and users' permission responses, from which a ranking algorithm is used to evaluate the expertise level of users and a voting algorithm is used to compute an appropriate response to the permission request (accept or reject). To bootstrap the recommendation system, RecDroid relies on a small set of seed expert users that could make reliable recommendations for a small set of application. Our evaluation results show that RecDroid can provide high accuracy and satisfying coverage with careful selection of parameters. The results also show that a small coverage from seed experts is sufficient for RecDroid to cover the majority of the app requests.","1573-0077","978-1-4799-8241-7","10.1109/INM.2015.7140304","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7140304","","Smart phones;Security;Mobile communication;Privacy;Portals;Google;Monitoring","","18","","43","IEEE","2 Jul 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Although it offers great convenience for both app developers and mobile users, this feature was frequently reported to serve malicious and aggressive purposes, such as delivering annoying push notification advertisement. However, to the best of our knowledge, this problem has not been studied by our research community so far. To fill the void, this paper presents the first study to detect aggressive push notifications and further characterize them in the global mobile app ecosystem on a large scale. To this end, we first provide a taxonomy of mobile push notifications and identify the aggressive ones using a crowdsourcing-based method. Then we propose sc DaPanda, a novel hybrid approach, aiming at automatically detecting aggressive push notifications in Android apps. sc DaPanda leverages a guided testing approach to systematically trigger and record push notifications. By instrumenting the Android framework, sc DaPanda further collects all notification-relevant runtime information to flag the aggressive ones. Our experimental results show that sc DaPanda is capable of detecting different types of aggressive push notifications effectively in an automated way. By applying sc DaPanda to 20,000 Android apps from different app markets, it yields over 1,000 aggressive notifications, which have been further confirmed as true positives. Our in-depth analysis further reveals that aggressive notifications are prevalent across different markets and could be manifested in all the phases in the lifecycle of push notifications. It is hence urgent for our community to take actions to detect and mitigate apps involving aggressive push notifications.","2643-1572","978-1-7281-2508-4","10.1109/ASE.2019.00017","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8952509","Push notification;dynamic analysis;advertisement;Android;mobile app","Taxonomy;Mobile applications;Advertising;Google;Ecosystems;Libraries;Australia","","16","","75","IEEE","9 Jan 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, many such data are only to be found encoded in text within esoteric scientific articles, a situation that makes automated extraction difficult and manual extraction time-consuming and error-prone. To address this challenge, we present a hybrid Information Extraction (IE) pipeline to improve the machine-human partnership with respect to extraction quality and person-hours, through a combination of rule-based, machine learning, and crowdsourcing approaches. Our goal is to leverage computer and human strengths to alleviate the burden on human curators by automating initial extraction tasks before prioritizing and assigning specialized curation tasks to humans with different levels of training: using non-experts for straightforward tasks such as validation of higher accuracy results (e.g., completing partial facts) and domain experts for low-certainty results (e.g., reviewing specialized compound labels). To validate our approaches, we focus on the task of extracting the glass transition temperature of polymers from published articles. Applying our approaches to 6 090 articles, we have so far extracted 259 refined data values. We project that this number will grow considerably as we tune our methods and process more articles, to exceed that found in standard, expert-curated polymer data handbooks while also being easier to keep up-to-date.

To maintain spectrum availability in its service region, it is desirable for the DBA to periodically collect spectrum measurements whereby to construct and maintain a Radio Environment Map (REM), where the received signal strength at every location of interest is either directly measured or estimated via proper statistical spatial interpolation techniques. Crowdsourcing-based spectrum sensing is a promising approach for periodically collecting spectrum measurements over a large geographic area, which is, unfortunately, vulnerable to false spectrum measurements. How to construct an accurate REM in the presence of false measurements remains an open challenge. This paper introduces SecREM, a novel scheme for securely constructing a REM in the presence of false spectrum measurements. SecREM relies on a small number of trusted spectrum measurements whereby to evaluate the trustworthiness of the measurements from mobile users and gradually incorporate the most trustworthy ones to construct an accurate REM.

However, high test quality and expected test context coverage are difficult to achieve in crowdsourced testing. Upon distributing a test task, mobile app providers neither know who to participate nor predict whether all the expected test contexts can be covered in the task. To address this problem, we put forward a novel research problem called Crowdsourced Testing Quality Maximization Under Context Coverage Constraint (Cocoon). Given a mobile app test task, our objective is to recommend a set of workers, from available crowd workers, such that the expected test context coverage and a high test quality can be achieved.

To measure the magnitude of such distortions, subjective or objective quality evaluation methodologies are employed. Lately, a remarkable amount of efforts has been devoted to the development of point cloud objective quality metrics, which have been reported to attain high prediction accuracy. However, their performance and generalization capabilities haven’t been evaluated yet in presence of artifacts from learning-based codecs. In this study, we tackle this matter by conducting the first crowdsourcing experiment for point cloud quality reported in the literature, in order to obtain subjective ratings for point cloud models whose topology and color attributes are encoded by both conventional and data-driven methods.

To that end, we perform the first empirical study of the complex dynamics between applications, MNOs and CSPs. First, we use real mobile app traffic traces that we gathered through a global crowdsourcing campaign to identify the most prevalent CSPs supporting today's mobile Internet. Then, we investigate how well these services interconnect with major European MNOs at a topological level, and measure their performance over European MNO networks through a month-long measurement campaign on the MONROE mobile broadband testbed. We discover that the top 6 most prevalent CSPs are used by 85 % of apps, and observe significant differences in their performance across different MNOs due to the nature of their services, peering relationships with MNOs, and deployment strategies. We also find that CSP performance in MNOs is affected by inflated path length, roaming, and presence of middleboxes, but not influenced by the choice of DNS resolver.","","978-1-5386-4128-6","10.1109/INFOCOM.2018.8485872","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8485872","","Cloud computing;Servers;IP networks;Conferences;Europe;Tools","","14","","42","IEEE","11 Oct 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To this end, outsourcing the spectrum sensing task to mobile users that are outfitted with spectrum sensors could greatly reduce the operator's expenditure, and meanwhile, achieve a satisfactory accuracy. The key of crowdsourced REM construction is to attract user participation.

However, crowdsourced RSS measurements are often unreliable and especially in indoor propagation environments they are strongly affected by shadowing and fading. It is thus important to understand which spatial interpolation method is better suited for such REMs. In this paper we present an extensive empirical performance evaluation of four major spatial interpolation methods for crowdsourced indoor Wi-Fi REMs: Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW), Gradient Plus Inverse Distance Squared (GIDS), Ordinary Kriging (OrK), and Universal Kriging (UnK). We evaluate them both quantitatively by the estimation error, and qualitatively by visually observing the resulting REMs from measured Wi-Fi beacon RSSs. In our experiments we used sixteen Raspberry Pi boards and we considered different measurement location densities and spatial distributions in an office environment with four rooms. Both the quantitative and qualitative analysis of our experimental results show that there is only a negligible difference in the accuracy of the REMs constructed using the four considered spatial interpolation methods, relative to the inherent variability in the RSS reported by different devices. This suggests that, in practice, for crowdsourced indoor Wi-Fi REMs, simpler methods like IDW may be preferred over more computationally complex methods like Kriging. Importantly, our analysis also shows that, for moderate measurement location densities, the global RSS estimation error over a large indoor area with multiple rooms does not comprehensively characterize the performance of spatial interpolation methods. In addition to considering this metric, a quantitative analysis of the local error specific to each room, and a qualitative evaluation of the observed topology of the resulting REM need to be performed. This is a novel observation and suggests that more sophisticated metrics should be investigated for different engineering applications of REMs.","2334-3125","978-1-5386-5191-9","10.1109/DySPAN.2018.8610487","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8610487","indoor REMs;Wi-Fi;crowdsourcing","Interpolation;Wireless fidelity;Random variables;Performance evaluation;Crowdsourcing;Interference;Dynamic spectrum access","","14","","29","IEEE","13 Jan 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we introduce a novel open-source architecture for IoT localization, coined Anyplace 4.0 IoT (A4IoT), which exploits signal fingerprinting to organize under the same roof a wide range of different localization technologies (e.g., Wi-Fi, BLE, Cellular, UWB, Computer Vision). We present the technical requirements of A4IoT inspired by the Alstom SA smart factory, operating worldwide in rail transport markets. A4IoT comprises a crowdsourcing architecture where deployers can collect and organize fingerprint signals inside smart spaces in a designated localization service running on the Edge (from Raspberry to Datacenter). The service incorporates timeseries databases for tracking targets and deployers can provide accurate room-level localization accuracy $(\approx 2\mathrm{m})$ on a variety of platforms (e.g., Android, Linux, Mac, Windows, Robot OS) but also integrate A4IoT through Web 2.0 endpoints to their software ecosystems.","2375-0324","978-1-7281-4663-8","10.1109/MDM48529.2020.00045","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9162205","IoT;mobile;indoor;location;crowdsourcing","Tools;Computer architecture;Internet of Things;Robots;Wireless fidelity;Sensors;Production facilities","","13","","29","IEEE","7 Aug 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Meanwhile, e-scooters come with challenges in city management, such as traffic rules, public safety, parking regulations, and liability issues. In this paper, we collected and investigated 5.8 million scooter-tagged tweets and 144,197 images, generated by 2.7 million users from October 2018 to March 2020, to take a closer look at shared e-scooters via crowdsourcing data analytics. We profiled e-scooter usages from spatial-temporal perspectives, explored different stakeholders (i.e., riders, gig workers, and ridesharing companies), examined operation patterns (e.g., injury types, and parking behaviors), and conducted sentiment analysis.

This method of acquiring human ratings in a lab environment is time-consuming and may also not reflect the typical viewing conditions. To overcome these disadvantages, crowd testing paradigms have been used for assessing video quality in general. Crowdsourcing-based tests enable a more diverse set of participants and also use a realistic hardware setup and viewing environment of typical users. However, obtaining valid ratings for high-resolution video quality poses several problems. Example issues are that streaming of such high-bandwidth content may not be feasible for some users, or that crowd participants lack an appropriate, high-resolution display device. In this paper, we propose a method to overcome such problems and conduct a crowd test using for higher resolution content by using a 540 p cutout from the center of the original 2160p video. To this aim, we use the videos from Test#1 of the publicly available dataset AVT-VQDB-UHD-1, which contains videos up to a resolution of UHD-1. The quality-labels available from that lab test allow us to compare the results with the crowd test presented in this paper. It is shown that there is a Pearson correlation of 0.96 between the lab and crowd tests and hence such crowd tests can reliably be used for video assessment of higher resolution content. The overall implementation of the crowd test framework and the results are made publicly available for further research and reproducibility1.","2472-7814","978-1-6654-3589-5","10.1109/QoMEX51781.2021.9465425","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9465425","Crowdsourcing;video quality assessment;subjective testing;adaptive streaming","Correlation;Streaming media;Reproducibility of results;Hardware;Quality assessment;Reliability;Video recording","","13","","35","IEEE","30 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we propose a secure decentralized framework for truth discovery with a privacy-preserving and reliable realization. Instead of relying on the central servers (e.g., public cloud servers)to behave correctly, our framework delegates the data aggregation and processing tasks to distributed entities, whose behaviors are enforced and verified by utilizing the emerging blockchain-based smart contract technology. Meanwhile, as the blockchain lacks support for on-chain data confidentiality, we utilize the privacy-preserving solution and integrate it with blockchain for privacy protection. Moreover, given the decentralized nature of our framework, it also overcomes the limitation of single point of failure. We implement a prototype of our framework using Ethereum blockchain and demonstrate its practical performance.","","978-1-5386-7117-7","10.1109/CNS.2019.8802712","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8802712","","Blockchain;Task analysis;Smart contracts;Servers;Privacy;Conferences;Crowdsourcing","","13","","27","IEEE","19 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Crowdsourcing has been invaluable for collecting annotations. This is particularly so for a task that goes beyond a clear-cut dichotomy as multiple human judgments per image are needed to reach a consensus.

Some previous approaches require explicit user inputs to label the locations of crowdsourced signals, which is inconvenient in practice. Others may rely on intensively-calibrated specialized sensors. Furthermore, the locations of crowdsourced signals are usually random and sparse, making it difficult to build a complete signal map. To address these, we propose Surecose, a novel signal map construction system by implicit crowdsourcing and interaction of low-cost cooperative sensors. Surecose is initialized with the light-weight sparse signal map collection. Having the background application on, the naive users are implicit surveyors unknowingly uploading crowdsourced signals. Phones may detect each other (mobile sensors), or beacons (fixed sensors). To label their locations, Surecose measures the mutual sensor proximity of the IoT devices. Via joint location labeling and sensor calibration, Surecose transparently locates the users despite devices used. Then Surecose constructs the database with a directionally and environmentally adapted Gaussian process, which scales the labeled locations and RSSIs anywhere into a complete signal map. Extensive experiments in diverse environments, including a campus hall, an international airport and a premium shopping mall, have validated that Surecose can adaptively and accurately construct the Wi-Fi signal map (often more than 20% reduction in RSSI construction error), with low survey cost (around 70% survey reduction) and little human intervention.","2155-5494","978-1-5090-6599-8","10.1109/SAHCN.2017.7964901","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7964901","","Sensors;Labeling;Mobile communication;Wireless fidelity;Crowdsourcing;Calibration;Databases","","11","","26","IEEE","3 Jul 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

MAPFEAT is evaluated by a real-world case study of the Fort McMurray wildfire, where we analyzed 69,680 unique tweets recorded over a period from May 2nd to May 7th, 2016. We found that (i) existing wildfire apps covered a range of 28 features with not all of them being considered helpful or essential, (ii) a large range of needs articulated in tweets can be mapped to features existing in non-emergency related apps, and (iii) MAPFEAT's suggested feature set is better aligned with the needs expressed by general public. Only six of the features existing in wildfire apps is among top 40 crowdsourced features explored by MAPFEAT, with the most important one just ranked 13th. By using MAPFEAT, we proactively understand victims' needs and suggest mobile software support to the people impacted. MAPFEAT looks beyond the current functionality of apps in the same domain and extracts features using variety of crowdsourced data.","","978-1-5386-2673-3","10.1109/ICSE-SEIS.2017.8","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7961668","Wildfire;Emergency;App store mining;Twitter;Mobile apps;Machine learning","Real-time systems;Mobile communication;Feature extraction;Software;Data mining;Twitter","","11","","36","IEEE","29 Jun 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We study the properties of direct trust, indirect trust, and trust community detection in Advogato. We found that 1) the trust between users are asymmetric, 2) high degree users are usually associated with high trust, 3) diversity in people's opinions on the same person will affect indirect trust inference, 4) users live in many separate “small small worlds” from the perspective of trust and it is difficult to identify these “small small worlds” with existing random walk-based community detection algorithms, e.g., ACL [2]. It in fact motivates the need for a new community detection algorithm to identify clusters of user connected by trustful relations.

The scheme called Random Multiparty Perturbation (RMP) addresses this challenge by allowing each participant to perturb his/her tabular data by passing the data through a nonlinear function, and projecting the data to a lower dimension using a participant-specific random matrix. Here, we propose an improvement to RMP by introducing a new nonlinear function. The improved scheme is assessed in terms of its recovery resistance to the maximum a priori (MAP) estimation attack. Experimental results and preliminary theoretical analysis indicate that RMP is resistant to collusion attacks and has better recovery resistance to MAP estimation attacks compared to the original scheme.

However, existing work ignores the locality characteristics of the developer-task dataset and the competition among developers. In this work, we propose a novel recommendation approach for task routing in competitive crowdsourced software development. First, we cluster tasks on the basis of content similarity. Second, for a given task, with the most similar task cluster, we utilize machine learning based classification to recommend a list of candidate developers.

Traditional methods rely on humans (workers or experts) to acquire labels. However, the human cost is rather expensive for a large dataset. Active learning based methods only label a small set of data with large uncertainty, train a model on these labelled data, and use the trained model to label the remainder unlabelled data. However they have two limitations. First, they cannot judiciously select appropriate data (task selection) and assign the tasks to proper humans (task assignment). Moreover, they independently process task selection and task assignment, which cannot capture the correlation between them. Second, they simply infer the truth of a task based on the answers from humans and the trained model (truth inference) by independently modeling humans and models. In other words, they ignore the correlation between them (the labelled data may have noise caused by humans with biases, and the model trained by the noisy labels may bring additional biases), and thus lead to poor inference results.To address these limitations, in this paper, we propose CrowdRL, an end-to-end reinforcement learning (RL) based framework for data labelling. To the best of our knowledge, CrowdRL is the first RL framework designed for the data labelling workflow by seamlessly integrating task selection, task assignment and truth inference together. CrowdRL fully utilizes the power of heterogeneous annotators (experts and crowdsourcing workers) and machine learning models together to infer the truth, which highly improves the quality of data labelling. CrowdRL uses RL to model task assignment and task selection, and designs an agent to judiciously assign tasks to appropriate workers. CrowdRL jointly models the answers of workers, experts and models, and designs a joint inference model to infer the truths. Experimental results on real datasets show that CrowdRL outperforms state-of-the-art approaches with the same (even fewer) monetary cost while achieving 5%-20% higher accuracy.","2375-026X","978-1-7281-9184-3","10.1109/ICDE51399.2021.00032","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9458763","reinforcement learning;crowdsourcing;data labelling;truth inference","Learning systems;Correlation;Uncertainty;Databases;Reinforcement learning;Data engineering;Data models","","10","","49","IEEE","22 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

With the wide adoption and use of social media platforms, the posts of someone give a window to his or her mind that can help detect mental health issues. Numerous researches were done to identify mental health conditions from posts in English language. Very few were done for Arabic language using traditional natural language processing (NLP) models. In this novel research, we use the latest NLP models, namely Bidirectional Encoded from Representations Transformers (BERT), for detecting depression in Arabic social media posts. We built CairoDep, a set of models and a benchmark dataset for this purpose. First, we built CairoDep v1.0 dataset, a labeled dataset of 7000 posts including 3400 normal (non-depressed) posts and 3600 depressed posts. Our dataset was collected from multiple sources, specifically crowdsourcing, Arabic mental health forums and pages, readily available datasets and translation from English datasets. Second, we further trained two pre-trained BERT transformers for Arabic language to detect depression from Arabic posts in Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) and dialectic Arabic, namely ARABERT and MARBERT. We further trained and evaluated them on the dataset using 80%-20% split. We achieved accuracy, precision, recall and F1-Score values of 96.93%, 96.92%, 96.93% and 96.92% for ARABERT and of 96.07%, 96.11%, 96.04% and 96.07% for MARBERT respectively. These results are quite superior to the results reported in the literature for depression detection using lexicon analysis or traditional machine learning techniques.

Then we investigate the approaches using texts and profile images, respectively, including Hashtag-based TF-IDF, LDA Topic Distribution, SIFT-based TF-IDF and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). Finally, we propose an ensemble method by combining models learned from both texts and images to enhance gender identification. The performance in our extensive experiments is demonstrated to be comparative with state-of the-art work.","","978-1-5090-4941-7","10.1109/WACVW.2017.8","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7912201","","Twitter;Biometrics (access control);Image recognition;Feature extraction;Face;Tagging","","10","","32","IEEE","27 Apr 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The role of data collected directly from Traffic Management Centers is explored; in addition, the collection and condensation of crowdsourced SPaT data sources is investigated as a complementary solution in situations where timing information is not available directly from a city's Traffic Management Center (TMC). In order to evaluate the effectiveness of communicating the traffic signal state to the in-vehicle driver assistance systems, on-road experiments were carried out by a number of drivers interacting with an implemented in-vehicle speed advisory application in mixed traffic on arterial roads in the city of San Jose, CA. The experiments show that on average a 9.5% decrease in fuel usage is possible if accurate SPaT data is available. We also experimentally evaluated the accuracy of the crowdsourcing algorithm in the city of San Francisco, CA.","2153-0017","978-1-5386-1526-3","10.1109/ITSC.2017.8317591","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8317591","","Vehicles;Urban areas;Servers;Probes;Timing;Cameras;Global Positioning System","","10","","23","IEEE","15 Mar 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"Regularized Multimodal Hierarchical Topic Model for Document-by-Document Exploratory Search","A. Ianina; K. Vorontsov","Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology, Moscow, Russia; Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology, Moscow, Russia",2019 25th Conference of Open Innovations Association (FRUCT),"6 Feb 2020","2019","","","131","138","In the exploratory search paradigm of information retrieval, the user has a complicated search demand that can not be formulated in a short query. The user collects thematically relevant information iteratively in a “query-browse-refine” process being motivated by learning, understanding, and knowledge acquisition purposes. We consider an elementary step of this scenario in which the search intent can be expressed by a long text query. For this case, we develop an exploratory search engine based on probabilistic topic modeling. Topic model gives a low-dimensional sparse interpretable vector representation (topical embedding) of a text. The search engine uses these embeddings for ranking documents by their similarity to the query. We show that performing only one query, the topic-based search engine achieves better precision and recall that human assessors do spending up to one hour in a conventional browse-refine loop. We use additive regularization for topic modeling (ARTM) to make the model simultaneously sparse, decorrelated, n-gram, multimodal and hierarchical. We show experimentally that each of these features of the model is important to achieve precision and recall higher than 90%. Topical hierarchy emulates a natural human strategy to focus on subtopics gradually discarding unnecessary information. Also we show that increasing the number of levels in the hierarchy improves the search quality and makes it possible to enrich the model with a larger number of topics. We use the fast parallel implementation of the regularized EM-algorithm from BigARTM open source project. We use crowdsourcing in order to collect relevance assessments for the search quality evaluation.","2305-7254","978-952-69244-0-3","10.23919/FRUCT48121.2019.8981493","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8981493","","","","10","","30","","6 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
