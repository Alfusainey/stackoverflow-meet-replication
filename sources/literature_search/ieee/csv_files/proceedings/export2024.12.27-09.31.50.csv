The methods include literature analysis and discussion with experts. We first examine the major problems of technology-oriented knowledge management model in knowledge sharing and knowledge creation: the emphasis on explicit knowledge, and the 'push' style that neglects the demand and motivation of individual. And then, by synthesizing and integrating relevant material, we propose a systematic Weblog-based knowledge management model of a 'pull' style and a practical implementation method in order to solve the problem of former model. By discussing the weaknesses of Weblog-based model - incompleteness in knowledge capturing and uncontrollability in management, we recommend that the best implementation is to combine the advantages of both models in order to form a two-way and cyclical Weblog-based model.","2161-1904","1-4244-0884-9","10.1109/ICSSSM.2007.4280206","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4280206","knowledge sharing and knowledge creation;weblog;weblog-based knowledge management model;technology-oriented knowledge management model;a two-way and cyclical weblog-based model","Knowledge management;Blogs;Publishing;Environmental economics;Uncertainty;History;Information processing;Glass;Social network services;Productivity","","4","","24","IEEE","30 Jul 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It aims to identify knowledge domains, which are relevant to enabling the future viability of traditional embroidery. This paper introduces a significance of traditional embroidery to China, including its geographical indications (GIs), intangible cultural heritage (ICH) and Soft Power. It also identifies the four traditional embroideries that represent the intangible cultural heritage of China. The situation analysis of these four embroideries is discussed, resulting in the rationale for selecting Shu embroidery for in-depth case study. Next, it outlines the meaning of knowledge management and knowledge audit and the five secondary case-studies of knowledge management in relation to business and community development. This results in the identification of key factors of success (collaboration, the importance of leadership in integration, customer-oriented, design and implementation and networks of knowledge sharing). Furthermore, it outlines five secondary case-studies of design contributions in relation to knowledge audit and business development of crafts communities. This results in the identification of potential areas for design contributions, including: product design and development (i.e., pattern design); design for marketing and sales (i.e., branding); design in production development; and design for craft education (i.e., knowledge transfer and knowledge sharing). Design for sustainability, co-design and service-design are critical to the success of community development. The next step of this research is about knowledge audit, including developments of a conceptual model of critical knowledge domains for business and community development. Fieldwork will be conducted in craft communities that produce Shu embroidery in Sichuan, China in order to identify their existing knowledge and the missing knowledge (gaps in knowledge). It concludes with three main research questions generated to help guide the fieldwork.","","978-1-5386-8072-8","10.1109/ECTI-NCON.2019.8692256","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8692256","traditional embroidery;knowledge management;design;China","Cultural differences;Knowledge management;Art;Media;Production;Fabrics","","4","","32","IEEE","18 Apr 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we present a deep reinforcement learning-based approach to improve the stability and robustness of power management while reducing the energy-delay product (EDP) under user-specified performance requirements. The comprehensive status of the system is monitored periodically, making our controller sensitive to environmental change. To further improve the learning effectiveness, knowledge sharing among multiple devices is implemented in our approach. Experimental results on multiple realistic applications show that the proposed method can reduce the instability up to 68% compared with QL.

This activity generates a valuable source of knowledge about the manufacturing processes in the company. However, the sharing and reuse of this knowledge is a challenge, because usually the knowledge is not semantically organized, and therefore its meaning depends on the understanding of the specialists involved. Also, there is a high fragmentation and distribution of knowledge along the production chain. Considering this scenario, this paper presents the development of a system for distributed knowledge sharing and reuse in the PFMEA domain using an ontology based on description logics, which intends to allow knowledge inference and retrieval in manufacturing environments with distributed resources.

Therefore, there is a need to implement a knowledge management (KM) initiative that facilitates the sharing of teaching practices among university instructors. In order to address this issue, this paper proposes a comprehensive and practical Computer-based Teaching Practices Management System (TPMS) which aims to foster instructors' participation in KS practices by employing a gamification approach. A design science research methodology is adopted in order to understand what would drive instructors to share their knowledge; this information is used in order to map their behavior to system features.

In order to produce mapping-pairs and implement ontology mapping and realizing knowledge sharing, a concept similarity algorithm combining semantic similarity with semantic relativity is adopted to estimate the similarity between concepts.

However, ML-based failure management typically requires that monitoring data is exchanged between network devices, where data is collected, and centralized locations, e.g., servers in data centers, where data is processed. ML algorithms in this centralized location are then trained to learn mappings between collected data and desired outputs, e.g., whether a failure exists, its cause, location, etc. This paradigm poses several challenges to network operators in terms of privacy as well as in terms of computational and communication resource usage, as a massive amount of sensible failure data is transmitted over the network. To overcome such limitations, Federated Learning (FL) can be adopted, which consists of training multiple distributed ML models at multiple decentralized locations (called “clients”) using a limited amount of locally-collected data, and of sharing these trained models to a centralized location (called “server”), where these models are aggregated and shared again with clients. FL reduces data exchange between clients and a server and improves algorithms’ performance thanks to sharing knowledge among different domains (i.e., clients), leveraging different sources of local information in a collaborative environment. In this paper, we focus on applying FL to perform failure-cause identification in microwave networks. The problem is modeled as a multi-class ML classification problem with six pre-defined failure causes. Specifically, using real failure data from an operational microwave network composed of more than 10000 microwave links, we emulate a multi-operator scenario in which one operator has partial knowledge of failure causes during the training phase. Thanks to knowledge sharing, numerical results show that FL achieves up to 72% precision in identifying an unknown particular class concerning traditional ML (non- FL) approaches where training is performed without knowledge sharing.","2576-3539","978-1-6654-8677-4","10.1109/RNDM55901.2022.9927592","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9927592","Microwave networks;failure identification;rootcause analysis;machine learning;federated learning;data privacy","Training;Privacy;Terminology;Transfer learning;Microwave communication;Data models;Hardware","","2","","24","IEEE","26 Oct 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We developed a questionnaire focusing on the state of use of technological tools in the managerial processes in different categories of organizations. The findings of this study verified, as expected, some given main barriers that influence the adaptation of E-management in Egypt. Such barriers include: lack of relevant training for employees, lack of IT training availability, limited knowledge level and knowledge sharing, lack of IT specialists in organizations, lack of Internet connectivity, lack of IT training availability, limited knowledge level and knowledge sharing, lack of PCs in management, Limited budgets.","","978-1-5386-4371-6","10.1109/COMAPP.2018.8460311","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8460311","E-commerce;e-Business;ICT;E-management;E-readiness;Information Technology","Security;Information and communication technology;Companies;Training;Industries","","2","","27","IEEE","13 Sep 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It is difficult to ensure availability of right knowledge at the right time to the right person during software engineering activity. The knowledge needs to be shared across the organization but limitations of knowledge sharing tools or dispersed knowledge sharing media and improper handling of tacit knowledge makes it more challenging to share knowledge. Significant amount of communication during software engineering process takes place via emails and discussion forums. Decisions taken during planning activities are also communicated through emails. These emails and the discussions do not necessarily cover the rationale behind a decision or approach adopted. This leaves a substantial portion of shared knowledge as tacit. Mostly, due to undefined tacit knowledge handling procedures, organizations suffer with the loss of critical knowledge and information. One way to handle this loss of knowledge is to store every information in knowledge repository but this can increase the size of the knowledge repository. This paper presents a three step approach to identify tacit knowledge in the written communication such that the organizations can save the tacit knowledge for future use. The presented approach does not only extract up to 57% of tacit knowledge but also indicates that only 20% of the whole communication need to be externalized hence saving 80% capacity of the knowledge repository, if every communication was to be preserved as potential tacit knowledge.","","978-1-6654-6377-5","10.1109/ICACS55311.2023.10089779","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10089779","tacit knowledge;unstructured knowledge;knowledge management;global software engineering;software lifecycle;project management;knowledge sharing","Knowledge engineering;Discussion forums;Organizations;Media;Software;Natural language processing;Knowledge management","","2","","19","IEEE","5 Apr 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

STCs in exemplary schools of ICT-integration instruction had more opportunities to liaise with STCs of other schools regarding ICT practices relative to similar opportunities regarding ICT-integration instruction. STCs are ""representatives"" who can put technician staffs of their respective schools in touch with STCs of other schools through technology knowledge exchange. This study provides quantitative evidence from social network analysis to answer why STCs have not received the necessary support for them to be effective.

Since knowledge sharing and reusing can reduce project time and cost, and improve management performance, knowledge management is becoming more important in construction industry than before. However, knowledge is separated and scattered in construction projects and each construction project is managed independently and separately, the knowledge acquisition, and sharing across projects becomes impossible when the employee moves from one company to another. In order to accumulate construction knowledge and reuse it, a conceptual framework of knowledge acquisition and sharing in construction multiple projects for contractors is suggested based on IDEF modeling. The construction knowledge in multiple projects is classified and recognized. Knowledge loss, which is barriers to improve construction management performance, is witnessed in construction project lifecycle and between projects. The web-based construction knowledge system is developed to facilitate knowledge sharing and reusing for the project teams and construction corporations. The construction knowledge system can be used to capture and share both explicit and tacit knowledge under multiple projects for contractors.","","978-0-7695-3488-6","10.1109/KAM.2008.112","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4732809","Construction knowledge;knowledge acquisition;multiple projects;contractors","Knowledge acquisition;Knowledge management;Project management;Construction industry;Scattering;Costs;Knowledge based systems;Knowledge engineering;Resource management;Performance loss","","2","","7","IEEE","30 Dec 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

On the other hand, organisations are adopting IT Service Capability Maturity Model (IT Service CMM) for managing their service-level processes at an increasing rate. At the time of writing, no explicit method existed within the current version of the IT Service CMM framework for addressing knowledge sharing and collaboration requirements of the actors involved in various service-level processes. In this paper, conceptual modeling language is selected and then applied to the IT Service CMM in order to enable identification of the collaboration requirements of various entities. This in turn is expected to enhance the quality and consistency of service delivery in IT service organisations that utilise the IT Service CMM. In order to evaluate and assess suitability of the selected modeling language in representing the collaboration context surrounding the IT Service CMM environment, the Conceptual Model Quality Framework (CMQF) was utilised. The aim of this evaluation method is to iteratively assess, and then enhance, the syntactic correctness, semantic quality, and pragmatism of the selected conceptual modeling language when applied to the IT Service CMM. The findings from the first iteration suggested that the proposed conceptual modeling language produced highly syntactically correct process models for the corresponding processes specified by the IT Service CMM, however it was moderately successful in completely demonstrating all aspects of the IT Service CMM. These results also suggest that the resulting knowledge representation models were difficult for their target audience to comprehend initially. As a result, a set of reffined process models were developed that improved the initial knowledge representations.","2151-1357","978-1-4244-1677-6","10.1109/RCIS.2008.4632110","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4632110","Information Technology Service Management;Information Technology Services Capability Maturity Model;knowledge sharing;awareness","Coordinate measuring machines;Collaboration;Capability maturity model;Business;Knowledge representation;Information technology;Interviews","","2","","15","IEEE","26 Sep 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The disentanglement is achieved by a novel Federated Dual Variational Autoencoder (FedDVA), which employs two encoders to infer the two types of representations. FedDVA can produce a better understanding of the trade-off between global knowledge sharing and local personalization in PFL. Moreover, it can be integrated with existing FL methods and turn them into personalized models for heterogeneous downstream tasks. Extensive experiments validate the advantages caused by disentanglement and show that models trained with disentangled representations substantially outperform those vanilla methods.","1945-788X","978-1-6654-6891-6","10.1109/ICME55011.2023.00062","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10219576","Federated Learning;Disentanglement;Variational Autoencoder","Federated learning;Reliability;Multimedia communication;Task analysis;Convergence","","2","","19","IEEE","25 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Mobile devices were used to immediately record and observe objects and enable learners to communicate with each other and engage in discussions, which raises their level of knowledge. The process of inquiry learning entails five steps: asking a question, attempting to answer the question, stimulating creative concepts, multiple people discussing the topic, and lastly, reaching a conclusion based on discourse and discovering an in-depth question from the conclusion, resulting in a new inquiry cycle. Therefore, to better understand learner behaviours in online knowledge-sharing discussions using location-based AR, we used an interaction analysis model to explore knowledge discussion behaviours among multiple participants to understand whether location-based AR helps students achieve higher phases of knowledge construction.","","978-1-4799-4230-5","10.1109/EITT.2014.20","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6982566","Cooperative learning;augmented reality;inquiry learning","Augmented reality;Learning systems;Educational institutions;Cognition;Roads","","2","","14","IEEE","15 Dec 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Besides, the implementation of a knowledge management system to stimulate knowledge sharing often fails. Literature shows that there are several techniques to measure communities of practice, individual, and organizational performance. But which technique should be used? Although discussed by several authors, there is still not yet a generic method that can be used to efficiently implement knowledge management interventions. In this paper, a method to measure community of practice performance is developed and validated.

This paper explores the influence of the cognitive nature of the task and the psychological empowerment of the individuals on the extent to which an individual engages in the creation, sharing, and application of knowledge. A model of how the nature of the task and the empowerment of knowledge workers are related to an individual's knowledge management practices is proposed and tested with structural equation modeling approach. The results suggest that the cognitive nature of the task drives knowledge creation. While the psychological empowerment of the knowledge worker enhances knowledge sharing and application, empowerment is not linked to knowledge creation.","1530-1605","978-0-7695-4892-0","10.1109/HICSS.2013.525","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6480287","","Knowledge management;Organizations;Psychology;Context;Mathematical model;Technological innovation;Reflection","","1","","43","IEEE","18 Mar 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As such services consume and generate a large amount of information, knowledge-sharing mechanisms are required to capture, transfer and reuse information across projects. So far, with the advent of the internet, the business community has mainly focused on web-based technologies for knowledge sharing. The most common approach is a web portal through which a practitioner can access the organization's collection of intellectual capital. This approach, however, has notable drawbacks. In particular, they often fail to stimulate active user participation, in terms of both contributing to and using the knowledge base. The problem, as we see it, is largely caused by the separation between the environment of a client engagement and that of knowledge management. In this paper, we propose a knowledge management system that is integrated into the process of delivering a client engagement. The integration is realized at two levels: at the content level, the knowledge is organized by a framework that is central to the client engagement at hand; at the tool level, the knowledge management system is embedded in the software for developing work products for a client engagement The advantages of the proposed integration over existing tools are discussed.","","978-1-4244-7119-5","10.1109/SOLI.2010.5551563","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5551563","","Variable speed drives;Communities;Educational institutions;Barium","","1","","19","IEEE","19 Aug 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We find that setting the feature layer to that before the classification head yields superior performance. Moreover, we investigate how to conduct the KD in terms of loss choices. We test various types of losses for enhancing the knowledge sharing and find that Center Kernel Alignment (CKA) achieves the best performance among the investigated loss metrics.

Regulation is a key enabler, as is knowledge sharing of how it is implemented by different users. This paper reports findings from projects implemented in France, Germany and Belgium. Time-correlated series data of wind power infeed, line loading levels, and measured thermal ratings were analyzed to assess the benefit of DLR for wind power integration. Not only real-time data but forecast data is also analyzed. In cases where wind integration is viewed as the main challenge, high power flows on the lines correlated with high wind infeed periods. Furthermore these periods of high power flows correlated with extra capacity made available by DLR. With increasing amounts of wind power installations, the frequency of high load periods increase on a line. These coincide with the extra capacity made available by DLR, resulting in benefits such as saved redispatch and curtailment costs, as well as increased hosting capacity to accelerate connection. However, it is not very clear how these benefits should be distributed in time: in the long-term planning; in day-ahead market exchange; or in close to real-time grid operations?

Then the knowledge collaboration mechanism is utilized to support knowledge collaborative creating and enriching, and cooperative sharing. In addition, the knowledge access control scheme is employed to ensure high security.

This approach can enhance data efficiency by enabling knowledge sharing between each recognition model. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach using Gait phase recognition (GPR) and Terrain classification (TC) as examples, the most conventional recognition tasks in lower-limb exoskeleton robots. We first created a high-performing GPR model that achieved a Root mean square error (RMSE) value of 2.345 ± 0.08 and then utilized its knowledge-sharing backbone feature network to learn a TC model with an extremely limited dataset. Using a limited dataset for the TC model allows us to validate the data efficiency of our proposed Multitask learning approach. We compared the accuracy of the proposed TC model against other TC baseline models. The proposed model achieved 99.5 ± 0.044% accuracy with a limited dataset, outperforming other baseline models, demonstrating its effectiveness in terms of data efficiency.

As a consequence when designing an educational process the context has to be carefully considered. Implementing ""situated learning"" is straightforward in traditional apprenticeship models that inspired the communities of practice model, and the centuries old university model, but poses a formidable challenge when knowledge and associated practices are to be shared with large numbers of students as it is the case in most contemporary, demand-driven universities and even more in MOOCs. The traditional, and well tested, face-to-face teaching model that is in place does not scale even if videoconferencing is utilized to include students at remote locations. A few years ago, MOOCs were presented as a viable ""solution"", but while participant numbers remain impressive, experiences also suggest that the learning experience does not scale as easily. In this paper we discuss an alternative knowledge sharing and learning model, the Shangh AI Lectures (SHAIL) developed at the University of Zurich, Switzerland in response to the need of making top quality higher education available to a worldwide audience. SHAIL combines some of the strongest aspects of traditional face-to-face teaching, but also allows lecturing from and to a community which is globally distributed. Findings from delivering the Shangh AI Lectures annually over five consecutive years to up to twenty universities from across the globe (North America, Africa, Europe, Asia, Oceania) suggest that SHAIL is a promising way to address ""global teaching"", but there are also challenges to be addressed such as: finding a common base with respect to university requirements, student goals and expectations, teaching styles, and of course the actual technologies used.","","978-1-4799-2947-4","10.1109/IE.2014.52","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6910463","Intercultural Education;Higher Education;MOOC;Multimedia;Videoconferencing","Educational institutions;Artificial intelligence;Robots;Communities;Videoconferences;Electronic mail","","","","40","IEEE","29 Sep 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Semantic web technology makes it possible to address the above problems by including the meaning to the information. Furthermore, information could be represented in a machine readable format. This offers potential for development of mechanisms to enhance the precision of search and provide information recommendation to users. This paper proposed a knowledge-sharing system used for enabling effective academic paper sharing used in a seminar course. Ontology is a knowledge model for describing user profile and seminar paper information. Its vocabulary was used as metadata for annotating information.

To address this shortcoming, we present an adaptive, privacy-exploiting, and evasion-resilient localized poisoning attack (PeLPA) that capitalizes on the inherent DP-noise to circumvent anomaly detection systems and hinder the optimal convergence of the CMARL model. We rigorously evaluate our proposed PeLPA attack in diverse environments, encompassing both non-adversarial and multiple-adversarial contexts. Our findings reveal that, in a medium-scale environment, the PeLPA attack with attacker ratios of 20% and 40% can lead to an increase in average steps to goal by 50.69% and 64.41%, respectively. Furthermore, under similar conditions, PeLPA can result in a 1.4x and 1.6x computational time increase in optimal reward attainment and a 1.18x and 1.38x slower convergence for attacker ratios of 20% and 40%, respectively.","2160-1348","979-8-3503-0378-0","10.1109/ICMLC58545.2023.10327979","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10327979","Differential Privacy;Adversarial Learning;Poisoning Attacks;Cooperative Multiagent Reinforcement Learning","Differential privacy;Adaptation models;Privacy;Adaptive systems;Reinforcement learning;Security;Anomaly detection","","","","31","IEEE","28 Nov 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The main purpose of this study is to develop a methodology to identify generic product knowledge and information to support knowledge sharing in a virtual collaboration environment. In this paper we propose a methodology for identification and modeling of product information, based on the Function-Behavior-Structure (FBS) principle. The FBS principle was then translated into classification of product information. The classification can give a comprehensive view of a product. The flexibility of classification developed in this research makes it easier to be implemented across various different type of product. It also provides a better understanding about the products and its subcomponents. The identification of product information was followed by translation of it into a model. A model of generic product information was successfully built.

The challenge for such teams is to align their process knowledge with specific less developed countries' cultural and political contexts. By means of a single case study, we were able to ascertain a strong demand for knowledge delivery and the possible benefits of synergetic opportunities. However, the knowledge processes, instruments, and tools at the disposal of globally dispersed teams are insufficient to meet their demands and promote optimal knowledge sharing. Consequently, we propose the implementation of a knowledge center (KC). As a service unit for knowledge management initiatives, such a center could support knowledge-sharing processes by considering a specific team's situational conditions.

Federated transfer learning is a promising solution that enables knowledge sharing in the above process to rapidly provide models required for new tasks. To achieve efficient transfer, the challenge lies in how to provide transferable and high-quality data for new tasks while preserving data privacy. In this paper, we propose a novel cross-application federated transfer learning framework based on collaborative generative adversarial networks named CPFTL-CGAN. Specifically, we innovatively propose a source domain selection scheme based on domain similarity, which aims to select the most optimal source domain among massive candidates for efficient knowledge sharing. Furthermore, a collaborative generative adversarial network has been designed to generate data similar to the source, which addresses the problem that private source domain data cannot be shared directly to the target domain and further enhances the quality of the generated data. Finally, domain adaptation based on generated data is performed on target clients. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that the proposed CPFTL-CGAN can effectively improve the learning efficiency and accuracy compared to single-device training locally, Fedavg and ACGAN-FTL.","1558-2612","979-8-3503-0358-2","10.1109/WCNC57260.2024.10570977","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:U21A20449); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10570977","Federated transfer learning;smart manufacturing;source domain selection;collaborative generative adversarial network","Training;Data privacy;Accuracy;Simulation;Transfer learning;Collaboration;Production","","","","17","IEEE","3 Jul 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Given the dynamic nature of the problem, the first contribution of the paper is to show how learning an environmental constraint such as the movement pattern of the objects leads to a dynamic zoom selection behaviour that significantly improves k-coverage across the network. In our second contribution we show that the speed of convergence of the learning approach can be improved by applying a knowledge-sharing scheme. This is achieved by employing an inter-camera communication strategy across the network. The results indicate that enabling a knowledge-sharing scheme retains the high performance of pure reinforcement learning approaches.

However, the on-going worldwide situation affects the sentimental state and especially for a teacher who struggle to adapt his course’s contents according to current variables. These challenges can be mitigated through personalized peer recommendations for teachers. A more-experienced teacher can provide the required support for a less-experienced one in the form of knowledge sharing. This paper proposes a matching approach to provide peer recommendations for teachers in consonance with their context and sentimental state.

"Optimal Decision Making in Knowledge Transfer Under Co-Opetition","",,"2008 4th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","18 Nov 2008","2008","","","1","4","Knowledge sharing among individuals and departments in the organization has been considered to be a crucial process. In this paper, a game-theoretic framework for analysing knowledge sharing in the context of co-opetition in which co-operation and competition exist simultaneously among agents has been introduced. Firstly, we assumed that the player could not transfer the knowledge that he received to other players arbitrarily, so the player in three-player situation must has a problem that how to determine with whom the knowledge should be shared. Subsequently, the paper uses the insights gained from the game-theoretic model to develop a preliminary set of management guidelines for the management of knowledge transfer under co-opetition environment. Finally, Examples were presented to illustrate the methodology and how decision was made.","2161-9654","978-1-4244-2107-7","10.1109/WiCom.2008.2691","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4680880","","Decision making;Knowledge transfer;Game theory;Environmental management;Knowledge management;Guidelines;Educational institutions;Mathematics;Computer science;Monopoly","","","","8","IEEE","18 Nov 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Our hypothesis is that semantic data models and semantic web applications foster knowledge sharing through the codification of tacit knowledge. We propose a topic map based technology for the management of unstructured information. Topic map technology enables the visualization of concepts through associations similar to the human thinking and unlike the traditional hierarchical way. This technology requires the clear definition of all concepts (topics) to ensure that all co-workers share a common meaning of each topic. The technology provides possibility to attach documents to all occurrences of a topic.","","978-0-85358-244-1","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7462065","Knowledge management;manager notes;topic map;semantic web;ontology","Ontologies;Semantic Web;Knowledge management;Metadata;Software;Standardization","","","","10","","28 Apr 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper makes an effort to the underlying factors of knowledge hoarding in eco-tourism destinations. It has been found that employees' responsiveness towards knowledge sharing differ considerably among different personality types. Ultimately this paper would serve as a platform for forming an effective knowledge sharing platform.","","978-81-8424-759-6","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6316799","Knowledge Sharing;Knowledge Hoarding;Personality Types;Organisational Learning;Eco-tourism","Monitoring;Engineering profession;Reliability;Correlation;Educational institutions;Acceleration;Books","","","","11","","1 Oct 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
