This paper reported a development of ontology that focus in pediatrie nutrition domain. This domain was chosen because it is one of the world problem. This ontology covers children's required nutrient intake and its amount. Besides that, it also covers the effect of excess and lack of nutrition. This pediatrie nutrition ontology has six main classes. They are Nutrient, Nutrient Function, Malnutrition, Malnutrition Caution, Food and Person. To enrich the knowledge, this ontology was completed by annotation. Knowledge in this ontology was validated by an expert that has qualification as a pediatrician with subspecialist in nutrition and metabolic diseases. To facilitate the expert in performing validation, we made an application prototype to query over OWL ontology with SPARQL. As the result of this research, this ontology can be a knowledge source of knowledge-based application. This research left In the next research, we suggest adding another related ontology to make ontology pediatrie nutrition get richer. Beside that, the addition of another languages can also make the interoperability of this ontology increased.","","978-1-4799-6527-4","10.1109/ICITSI.2014.7048236","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7048236","Malnutrition;Pediatric Nutrition;Ontology;Semantic Technology","Ontologies;Semantics;Knowledge based systems;Prototypes;Resource description framework;Diseases","","3","","18","IEEE","26 Feb 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Seizing cell phones became a usual procedure in investigations and digital forensics may be demanded to verify conspiracies about the committed crime. The accelerated growth of cell phones as an indispensable accessory nowadays, followed by a massive adherence to Instant Messaging (IM) applications, has changed the way mankind is interacting virtually. Although IM applications provide several benefits for real-time contact and knowledge sharing, they are also used in private communications for illicit arrangements. When several cell phones are seized in a police operation, many communications using IM may be used as evidence of the committed crime. An investigator spends many hours trying to rearrange this conversation or reading repeated information. This work presents a solution to this problem, retrieving all conversations sequentially from a set of cell phones that participate in the same WhatsApp group. The solution is illustrated with a case study that validates the model and algorithm developed for this purpose.

Over the last few decades, we have seen some major changes in the way in which we share information. In particular, we have moved into an age of electronically-shared content, and there is an increasing expectation in Canada that this content is both culturally significant and relevant. In this paper, we discuss an ongoing community engagement initiative with First Nations communities in the Western Manitoba region. The initiative involves knowledge-sharing activities that focus on the topic of cybersecurity, and are aimed at a public audience. This initial look into our educational project focuses on the conceptual analysis and planning stage. We are developing a “Cybersecurity 101” mini-curriculum, to be implemented over several one-hour long workshops aimed at diverse groups (these public workshops may include a wide range of participants, from tech-adverse to tech-savvy). Learning assessment tools have been built in to the workshop program. We have created informational and promotional pamphlets, posters, lesson plans, and feedback questionnaires which we believe instill relevance and personal connection to this topic, helping to bridge gaps in accessibility for Indigenous communities while striving to build positive, reciprocal relationships. Our methodology is to approach the subject from a community needs and priorities perspective. Activities are therefore being tailored to fit each community. We hope this will lead to increased awareness and engagement by community members. Two Indigenous student research assistants were hired to assist in this project, which has developed into a blend of community outreach on the topic of security and data protection (most notably with respect to social media and online banking) and a computing education student-led educational research project.","2576-7046","978-1-7281-5442-8","10.1109/CCECE47787.2020.9255753","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9255753","Cybersecurity;Indigenous;Education;Public Interest;Internet","Conferences;Computer security;Education;Social networking (online);Media;Planning;Computer science","","2","","19","IEEE","19 Nov 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"Informal IT and Routine Activity Theory -A Theoretical Review","A. Shaikh; D.

The use of informal IT tools and resources at the workplace becomes a routine phenomenon which has diminished the boundaries between work and personal life domains. Also, it has increased the complexity of employees’ IT usage and created indistinctness in work ethics. It is a fact that the biggest threat organizations face today is the threat posed by their own employees. I propose that utilizing routine activity theory (RAT) from criminology to information system literature perspective is critical to understand the likelihood of insider threat as a consequence of informal IT usage. RAT assumes that a crime can arise from changes in the situation or environmental settings. Prior research reveals several positive outcomes of informal IT such as; employees’ productivity, job satisfaction, efficiency, collaboration, knowledge sharing, and lowering of operational costs for organizations. Bdes positive outcomes, prior research has also indicated the likelihood of security risks through informal IT usage. Guided by RAT, this research seeks to present a conceptual framework that explains that informal IT usage may jeopardize information security and may consider the activity as an insider threat. This research will, therefore. assist in developing more precise empirical and theoretical knowledge related towards informal-IT usage research in particular and overall to the information systems security research.","1558-058X","978-1-7281-0137-8","10.1109/SoutheastCon42311.2019.9020557","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9020557","Informal IT;Routine Activity Theory;Information Security;Insider Threat","Organizations;Employment;Rats;Tools","","2","","39","IEEE","5 Mar 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

With the tremendous success that public social network services have achieved in the past few years, many specialized social network services and enterprise social network services have emerged during the same period. Campus social network service is a special type of enterprise social network service. Cloud social network service platform on campus provides information communication, knowledge sharing, and online collaboration services to campus users in different aspects of colleges and universities through multiple social domains. In this paper, we discuss the design and implementation of data management in the platform which is performed by domain data manager. The purpose of data management is to keep the flexibility of data storage while providing integrated interfaces for data access, data maintenance and database schema maintenance. In other words, integrated and flexible data management gives cloud social network platform better scalability and maintainability. In order to do this, we first divide data space of the platform into logical data space and physical data space. Then we set up data mapping model between the two data spaces. Finally, we build up four services in domain data manager. With all these considerations, we expect to be able to optimize data storage to achieve faster data access speed without the need to modify the code of the platform.","","978-1-4673-2964-4","10.1109/ICCSNT.2012.6526148","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6526148","Data Management;Campus Social Network Service;Multi-Domain;Cloud Computing","","","2","","10","IEEE","10 Jun 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Current literature does not provide a cohesive picture of how agile methods scale into account, like large and often distributed software development projects. Some studies claim that Communities of Practice (CoPs) can be essential to successfully adopting agile practices, especially in large organizations. CoPs are groups of experts who share a common interest or topic and collectively wish to deepen their knowledge. This study highlights how CoPs are applied and used to promote and scale agile methods in large projects. To answer the research question, “How have Communities of Practice been used to support large-scale agile development teams?” we conducted a Systematic Literature Mapping (SLM) in the context of “Largescale Agile Methods” and “Communities of Practice”. Thus, from twenty-one studies, it was possible to synthesize three different themes and 13 categories that promote good practices in the adoption of CoPs to scale agile methods, including “coordination between teams”, “knowledge sharing”, and “open community”.","2771-5752","978-1-6654-7671-3","10.1109/CLEI56649.2022.9959929","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9959929","Communities of practice;Large-scale agile software development;Scaling agile frameworks;Systematic literature mapping.","Systematics;Agile software development;Companies;Software","","2","","0","IEEE","28 Nov 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The organizations that will be most successful over the next decade are those that recognize this simple fact. The advantage provided by data that has been transformed into useful information is undeniable: information derived from measurement data can be used to drive differentiation, optimization, and innovation. The future's biggest data challenge lies in effectively managing acquired data to give context to what is otherwise just a series of numbers across thousands of files. Instrumentation hardware vendors have accelerated data collection rates so quickly and enabled engineers and scientists to break through data rate and resolution-barriers so rapidly that today, data is coming in at a truly blistering pace. Unfortunately, the same can't be said for the rate of education on proper data storage, management and post-processing techniques. As a result, many organizations have been forced to devise their own schemes for data storage and management since they've effectively been left to their own accord. As a further consequence, many groups within the same organizational entity have adopted conflicting data strategies; this fractured outcome makes it nearly impossible to yield efficiency gains from data collaboration and knowledge sharing. After a brief introduction to the significance of data in the world today and the challenges that engineers and scientists currently face, this presentation will educate the audience on several technologies and techniques that provide a more modular, scalable approach to data management and yield the following benefits: Acquired data will gain context: descriptive information stored throughout the data acquisition and processing life cycle makes data traceable, trackable, usable, and logical to store. Acquired data will be searchable: data mining makes it easy to locate the data that you need, when you need it. Acquired data will be easier to process: from analysis to reporting, data management reduces the many roadblocks in data processing, particularly as data sets grow in size.","","978-1-4673-5836-1","10.1109/FIIW.2011.6476827","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6476827","","Context;Memory;Software;Data mining;Instruments;Databases;Data acquisition","","2","","","IEEE","11 Mar 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Ontology is the explicit formal specification of the terms in a domain and the relations between them. It has been used extensively for knowledge sharing, application integration, and the most for providing the capability of machines to understand and exchange web content. This paper addresses the possibility of using Ontology for linking the verses of the Holy Quran with the multimedia resources found on the web.

In this research a novel model based on social network analysis is proposed to find the experts who are the members of social networks by means of business intelligence approach. This model is verified by real data from Friendfeed social network. First, data is extracted, transformed and loaded to data warehouse with ETL processes. Then a new ranking algorithm is proposed for finding the experts, and finally the obtained results are compared to the experts' opinions utilizing spearman's correlation function.","2164-7054","978-964-463-428-4","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5955883","expert finding;social networks;link analysis;business intelligence;data warehouse optimization;best spanning tree","","","1","","","","18 Jul 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Semantic web, which was introduced in 2001 by Tim Berners-Lee, is an attempt to enable machines to understand or recognize information on the web. A lot of data on the World Wide Web is present in the form of databases and other structured data stores that can be converted to a form which is universally accepted and understood by all applications across the web. In this paper, in order to access and present the information using semantic web technique we have used a gadget called sticky notes (desktop based gadget). The information that is fetched from the web using semantic web algorithm for fetching data from data stores across the web is filtered to obtain relevant information which is then presented using sticky notes. An interesting feature of this algorithm is the ability to store information about the origin and other details of the information with the presented information using metadata generation and attribute based filtering. Based on the above, a relatively easier method of building knowledge sharing platforms for desktop applications is also presented.","","978-1-4244-8679-3","10.1109/ICECTECH.2011.5941983","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5941983","Knowledge representation;semantic web;knowledge writing;Semantic desktop;knowledge discovery;user interface;RDF","Resource description framework;Semantics;Knowledge engineering;Filtering;Electronic mail;User interfaces","","1","","12","IEEE","7 Jul 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The decen-tralized deployment of threat intelligence on edge devices, coupled with adaptive machine learning techniques such as the in-context learning feature of Large Language Models (LLMs), represents a promising paradigm for enhancing cybersecurity on resource-constrained edge devices. This approach involves the deployment of lightweight machine learning models directly onto edge devices to analyze local data streams, such as network traffic and system logs, in real-time. Additionally, distributing computational tasks to an edge server reduces latency and improves responsiveness while also enhancing privacy by processing sensitive data locally. LLM servers can enable these edge servers to autonomously adapt to evolving threats and attack patterns, continuously updating their models to improve detection accuracy and reduce false positives. Furthermore, collaborative learning mechanisms facilitate peer-to-peer secure and trustworthy knowledge sharing among edge devices, enhancing the collective intelligence of the network and enabling dynamic threat mitigation measures such as device quarantine in response to detected anomalies. The scalability and flexibility of this approach make it well-suited for diverse and evolving network environments, as edge devices only send suspicious information such as network traffic and system log changes, offering a resilient and efficient solution to combat emerging cyber threats at the network edge. Thus, our proposed framework can improve edge computing security by providing better security in cyber threat detection and mitigation by isolating the edge devices from the network.","2836-3795","979-8-3503-7696-8","10.1109/COMPSAC61105.2024.00206","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10633440","Edge Computing;Threat Intelligence;Machine Learning (ML);Large Language Model (LLM)","Adaptation models;Image edge detection;Computational modeling;Prevention and mitigation;Telecommunication traffic;Threat assessment;Software","","1","","4","IEEE","26 Aug 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, standard multimodal approaches often assume consistent modalities between training and inference, limiting applications in many real-world use cases, as some modalities may not be available during inference. While existing research mitigates this problem through reconstructing the missing modalities, they unavoidably increase unnecessary computational cost, which could be just as critical, especially for large, deployed infrastructures in industry. To this end, we propose a novel guidance network that promotes knowledge sharing during training, taking advantage of the multimodal representations to train better single-modality models to be used for inference. Real-world experiments in violence detection shows that our proposed framework trains single-modality models that significantly outperform traditionally trained counterparts, while avoiding increases in computational cost for inference.","2995-1429","979-8-3503-7981-5","10.1109/ICMEW63481.2024.10645412","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10645412","Multimodal deep learning;Vision-language model;Content moderation;Violence detection","Training;Knowledge engineering;Industries;Deep learning;Limiting;Computational modeling;Conferences","","1","","35","IEEE","29 Aug 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
