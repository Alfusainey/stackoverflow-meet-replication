Recent works based on geomagnetic information require a user to follow the exact path of previous users, which limits its applicability. Meanwhile, the optimal navigation path may not be provided given a large number of paths with different sources and destinations. We present MeshMap, an efficient indoor navigation system by merging geomagnetic information of crowdsourcing paths. MeshMap combines geomagnetic information from multiple users' paths to construct a global navigation map. Then, MeshMap supports to find the optimal navigation path on the navigation map. Finally, MeshMap proposes a real-time tracking method to map user's position on the navigation path and provides real-time navigation hints. We implement MeshMap on Android and evaluate its performance in different environments including campus building, parking area and shopping mall. The evaluation results show the effectiveness of MeshMap.","1521-9097","978-1-5386-2129-5","10.1109/ICPADS.2017.00017","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8368346","Indoor Navigation;Smartphone;Sensory Data","Magnetometers;Legged locomotion;Indoor navigation;Real-time systems;Wireless fidelity;Magnetic separation","","","","26","IEEE","31 May 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Conflicts and errors are constantly emerging. Truth discovery aims to find trustworthy information from conflicting data by considering source reliability. However, most traditional truth discovery approaches are designed only for structured data, and fail to meet the strong requirements to extract trustworthy information from unstructured raw text data. The major challenges of inferring reliable information on text data stem from the multifactorial property (i.e., an answer may contain multiple different key factors, which may be complex) and the diversity of word usages (i.e., different words may share similar semantic information, but the spelling of which are completely different). To solve these challenges, an ant colony optimization based text data truth discovery model is proposed. Firstly, keywords extracted from the whole answers of the specific question are grouped into a set. Then, we translate the truth discovery problem to a subset optimization problem, and the parallel ant colony optimization is utilized to find correct keywords for each question based on the hypothesis of truth discovery from the whole keywords. After that, the answers to each question can be ranked based on the similarities between keywords of user answers and identified correct keywords found by colony. The experiment results on real dataset show that even the semantic information of text data is complex, our proposed model can still find trustworthy information from complex answers compared with retrieval-based and state-of-the-art approaches.","","978-1-7281-4493-1","10.1109/DSAA.2019.00031","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8964181","truth discovery, ant colony optimization, text mining","","","","","40","IEEE","23 Jan 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

So far the majority of benchmarks rely on pattern-based SPARQL query generation approaches. The subsequent natural language (NL) question generation is conducted through crowdsourcing or other automated methods, such as rule-based paraphrasing or NL question templates. Although some of these datasets are of considerable size, their pitfall lies in their pattern-based generation approaches, which do not always generalize well to the vague and linguistically diverse questions asked by humans in real-world contexts. In this paper, we introduce Spider4SPARQL -a new SPARQL benchmark dataset featuring 9,693 previously existing manually generated NL questions and 4,721 unique, novel, and complex SPARQL queries of varying complexity. In addition to the NL/SPARQL pairs, we also provide their corresponding 166 knowledge graphs and ontologies, which cover 138 different domains. Our complex benchmark enables novel ways of evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of modern KGQA systems. We evaluate the system with state-of-the-art KGQA systems as well as LLMs, which achieve only up to 45% execution accuracy, demonstrating that Spider4SPARQL is a challenging benchmark for future research.","","979-8-3503-2445-7","10.1109/BigData59044.2023.10386182","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10386182","Benchmark for Question Answering over Knowledge Graphs;Language Models;Performance Evaluation","Measurement;Crowdsourcing;Natural languages;Knowledge graphs;Benchmark testing;Ontologies;Question answering (information retrieval)","","","","25","IEEE","22 Jan 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

"CHS-Scheduler: A Hybrid Scheduler for QoS Task Scheduling in Cloud Human Service Scenarios","R. Zhang; Z. Zhu","School of Software Engineering, University of Science and Technology of China, Suzhou, China; Suzhou Institute for Advanced Research, University of Science and Technology of China, Suzhou, China",2022 7th International Conference on Cloud Computing and Big Data Analytics (ICCCBDA),"26 May 2022","2022","","","38","47","With the rapid advancement of crowdsourcing and services technology, human service ecosystem is evolving rapidly and scenarios within it are diversifying. Represented by consulting service platforms on the cloud, task scheduling in such cloud human service scenarios has more key features than traditional QoS cloud scheduling scenarios, such as dynamic human processing capability and statistical property in task flows. Rule based scheduling heuristics usually produces poor scheduling results in multi-target scenarios and have limited adaptability as using local scheduling information. Scheduling algorithms based on meta-heuristics is time-consuming and tend to fall into local optima prematurely when facing large-scale task flows. More importantly, these scheduling methods pay little attention to optimizing those key features mentioned above. Thus, an efficient task scheduling approach is urgently needed as a key to future computing systems for these scenarios. In this paper, we propose CHS-Scheduler, a hybrid scheduler for QoS task scheduling in cloud human service scenarios. Firstly, a scheduling model focusing on statistical property in task flows and dynamic human processing capability is constructed. Secondly, a two-stage scheduling methodology is given. Stage one is a task scheduling algorithm based on static & dynamic hybrid dimensionality reduction mechanism. Stage two is a solution domain mapping mechanism based on incremental learning. Experiments show that CHS-Scheduler exhibits state-of-the-art performance in both batch scheduling and online scheduling.","","978-1-6654-8711-5","10.1109/ICCCBDA55098.2022.9778292","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9778292","task scheduling;cloud human service scenarios;human as a service;incremental learning","Dimensionality reduction;Crowdsourcing;Cloud computing;Scheduling algorithms;Heuristic algorithms;Ecosystems;Focusing","","","","28","IEEE","26 May 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Crowds were sometimes seen as a positive occurrence - for instance, when they formed for political rallies or to support sports teams - but were more often associated negatively with riots, a mob mentality, or looting. Under today’s lens, they are viewed more positively. Crowds have become useful! Crowdsourcing as an online, distributed problemsolving model suggests that approaching crowds and asking for contributions can help organizations develop solutions to a variety of business challenges. In this context, “the crowd” is often treated as a single construct: a general collection of people that can be targeted by firms. However, just as organizations and their problems vary, so do the types of crowds and the different kinds of contributions they can offer the firm. In this mini-track, we will discuss these diverse types of crowds and crowdsourcing initiatives across different organizational and IT contexts. Our first team of presenters, Benedikt Morschheuser, Juho Hamari and Jonna Koivisto will provide a review of the use of Gamification in Crowdsourcing. This will be followed by John Prpic and Prashant Shukla’s presentation of the models, methods and measurements of Crowd Science.

Changes in technology, globalization, and increased competition have all created an environment in which creativity and innovation are needed in order to cope with situational and economic pressures and frequent changes. Designers and Developers of organizational systems must therefore innovate almost continuously to keep the organization aligned with such changes. Creativity is a critical pre-condition for innovation. Generating novel and creative ideas are the key to innovation and growth in every organization today. Providing employees with tools to think creatively has been proven to increase innovation in organizations. Research shows that organizations which have established skill-bases and tools for creativity outperform the competition in terms of revenue, rolling out new products, innovation and growth. Though organizations deploy groups for most creative processes, there has been little research in the area of group creativity. Most creative research is focused on individual factors affecting creativity. Many challenges that arise from pursuing creativity in teams remain unexplored. Consequently, it is important that creativity in teams be given a central place in organizational research. This year we received twelve papers, six of which were accepted. These submissions cover a variety of topics ranging from theoretical development to field experiences with group creativity to algorithms and tools to support idea selection. The first paper by Stan examines the effects of group structure and evaluation pressure on group creativity. The author's investigation of 32 teams working on an idea generation task offers support for the notion that teams working under an imposed, functional structure create higher quality results than teams that work under an emergent structure. The author's findings offer insights for design considerations of organizational creative teams. The next paper by Majchrzak, Birnbaum-More, and Johnson presents a qualitative longitudinal study of 31 creative teams. The authors investigated two practices that these teams used to manage their creative process: maintaining engagement and co-creating shared boundary objects. They found that these practices affected the assessment of the teams' innovativeness. Based on the findings, the authors recommend (1) that team members should engage in the co-creation of boundary objects early in the life of the team, and (2) that members need to maintain their engagement with a team, e.g. through the use of collaboration technology, even when they have to focus on other projects. The paper by Kempe, Horton, Buchholz, and Görs, ""An Optimal Algorithm for Raw Idea Selection under Uncertainty"" address the challenge of selecting the initial ideas for further development from a large set of raw ideas. The authors propose a ranking algorithm based on pair wise comparisons to be made by knowledgeable decision makers. Through a detailed exposition of the algorithm they show that its use will reduce uncertainty and effectively involve expert knowledge in the idea selection process. The next paper, ""A Collaborative Algorithm for Computer-Supported Idea Selection in the Front End of Innovation"" comes from the same research group. In this paper, another selection algorithm is proposed based on a method used in computer-based sorting. This algorithm combines individual and group-based selections to balance speed and simplicity with high quality selections. An experiment showed that the proposed algorithm compares favorably with individual and group methods. ""Cross-Level Influence of Team Characteristics on Individual Idea Generation in Technology-Supported Teams"", by Srinivasan, Maruping, and Robert investigates the use of technology to support idea generation in groups. The authors draw on multilevel theory to understand the interplay between team characteristics and individual goal striving in influencing individual idea generation performance. Their results show that individual goal striving is a stronger predictor of individual idea generation performance in dispersed team contexts compared to co-located team contexts and in larger teams than in smaller teams. The final paper by de Vreede, Boughzala, de Vreede, and Reiter-Palmon, ""A Model and Exploratory Field Study on Team Creativity"" proposed a causal model of the antecedents of team creativity that combines individual creativity, knowledge sharing, and the formation of shared mental models. The authors provide anecdotal support for the constructs in their model through a study of an innovation team in a Telecom company.","1530-1605","978-0-7695-4525-7","10.1109/HICSS.2012.370","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6148633","","","","1","","","IEEE","9 Feb 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

"“Defense Health Information System as a case study for national health IT”","S. K. Mun","Institute of Advanced Study, Virginia Technology, USA",2009 First Annual ORNL Biomedical Science & Engineering Conference,"19 Jun 2009","2009","","","1","2","The National Forum on the Future of Defense Health Information Systems (National Forum) held in Washington, DC in March 2008 provided a unique opportunity to conduct a case study of developing a large complex health information system. The concept of the health information system has evolved from the days to electronic hospital information system (HIS) to longitudinal health record (LHR) which refers to a complete information system that adequately captures what occurs to service persons from ldquocradle to graverdquo, including but not limited to the clinical record. As originally imagined after the first Gulf War, the LHR is supposed to serve many functions in occupational health, medical logistics, health planning, and medical surveillance as well as clinical care. The LHR has become central to both DoD and VA health systems. As LHR emerges, the interoperable national health information system is becoming critical for the future. DoD and VA collaboration has accelerated in the last two years as exemplified by current efforts to exchange information between AHLTA (DoD Health IT system) and VistA (VA health IT system). With almost 70% of defense and veteran healthcare happening outside of the DoD/VA system, the LHR must accept information from the private sector not only Government sources. Given their size and position, DoD and VA have the potential to lead the nation in supporting standards for national health information network (NHIN). With that in mind, the VA and DoD are coordinating their efforts with the Office of the National Coordinator Health Information Technology (ONCHIT) that is leading the nation's interoperability and information exchange effort. Knowledge discovery and management is vital to bringing benefits of data repository to the clinicians and researchers. The growth of clinical data, image files, physiologic data, and omic data among others has produced an information explosion in healthcare and forced successful organizations to become knowledge-driven enterprises. Moreover, the recent IOM Roundtable on ldquoData for the Public Goodrdquo discussed the current challenges of aggregating large sets of data while taking the position that exploiting large databases would significantly accelerate science. Although DoD and VA have numerous databases and two of the largest growing clinical data tissue repositories in the world, they lack a common healthcare data model to link the databases together and sponsor no significant effort to create an infrastructure to make this data available for research. The MHS currently also lacks a strategy for managing its growing amount of data. Recently, MHS has worked with TATRC and IBM to develop a roadmap for developing a strategy but much more work remains. There are increasing needs for efficient software engineering and ability to integrate innovations in IT development process. Many participants expressed dissatisfaction with the current performance of AHLTA. Slow and awkward to use, AHLTA delays clinical work at a time when maximizing physician throughput really matters. The IT development occurred in a closed environment, insulated from evolving new ideas and best practices outside the DoD. As a result, while the previous efforts developed and implemented software for health care applications, global advances in information technology render it obsolete by the time it becomes available for use. With these problems and consequences in mind, participants in the National Forum consistently called for more open process of software engineering, program management and knowledge sharing to allow lessons learned to flow freely among government, academic and industrial partners in the software development process. As the health IT and personal health records (PHR) have become important national agenda, the experiences gained from the development and deployment of health IT systems in DoD and VA should provide important lessons for the national community.","","978-1-4244-3837-2","10.1109/BSEC.2009.5090451","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5090451","","Information systems;Medical services;Databases;Biomedical imaging;Acceleration;Government;Information technology;Knowledge management;Software engineering;Hospitals","","","","","IEEE","19 Jun 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Such tasks require extensive coordination and sense making to facilitate joint problem solving and the creation of shared mental models. Furthermore, multiple heads often come with multiple stakes and perspectives, which can lead to conflict and often require trust building and negotiation. Therefore, the cognitive load involved in collaborative tasks is likely to be higher than in individual tasks, and requires special attention when designing collaboration support. Understanding cognitive load and cognitive activities involved in collaboration may offer insight into design principles that enable efficient and effective use of cognitive capacity. The intent of this minitrack is to provide an outlet for such research and encourage research that explores the individual cognitive perspective when studying collaboration.","1530-1605","978-0-7695-4525-7","10.1109/HICSS.2012.23","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6149468","","","","","","","IEEE","9 Feb 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To allow an easy access to knowledge, organizations are implementing Knowledge Repositories. While this type of automation made it easy to store and distribute knowledge, it also made it easy to move knowledge outside the boundaries of a company. Organizations put in place many technology-based security measures (firewalls, filtering systems), yet they shouldn’t overlook the human-side of security practices. An organization can have the best security technology in place, yet a careless employee talking or emailing or posting on Facebook about the ‘new development’ at the company bypasses all this security technology with ease. One can find lot of information about current projects done by a company by searching the web. How can an organization effectively protect its intellectual property remains an answered question. What type of security and intelligence techniques are out that that can protect the IP? What are the best ways to train employees so that they would spot potentially criminal activity among employees? Could crowdsourcing be used in this case, meaning asking employees to vote on a particular issue to determine whether it represents a potential threat? This mini-track seeks papers that investigate issues related to security and protection of intellectual assets and explore how organizations can use security measures to protect their KM practices.

However, such an assumption is not realistic in many real world problems. Sequential decision making, a more general decision structure, exists commonly in our daily life, such as answer or vote on Q&A sites, tweets and comments on Twitter, access point association in wireless communications, channel access in cognitive radio networks, and so on. These examples share several characteristics: information asymmetry, network externality, and decision dependence. Such characteristics are the keys to understand how agents may behave under certain decision structure. Existing simultaneous decision making models cannot capture these key characteristics and therefore lead to inaccurate prediction or inefficient configuration, eventually degrade the system performance. In this tutorial, we present a series of game-theoretic frameworks to analyze and manage how rational users make sequential decisions with asymmetric information under different settings. We will provide in-depth theoretic analysis and share our experience in data-driven experimental results on various applications.","","978-1-5386-1542-3","10.1109/APSIPA.2017.8281988","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8281988","","","","","","","IEEE","8 Feb 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, some tasks remain to be assigned to biological organisms. Seeing eye dogs have not yet been functionally replaced by assistive technology; digital pets are still less commonly the recipients of human affection than real pets. Both science and arts have experimented amply with integration of biological entities and technological systems, with the goal of complex task achievement. Cockroaches, neural cells, fish and slime molds were employed to control robots. Communities of real crickets were shown to interact with robots. Pigeons, bats and dogs were used as sensory and decision-making parts in technological systems. Crickets, hamsters and paramecia have driven the behavior of non-player characters in computer games. Through crowdsourcing, even humans serve as key components in greater digital systems.","2150-4946","978-1-4799-0786-1","10.1109/DEST.2013.6611312","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6611312","","","","","","","IEEE","26 Sep 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

"A Review of Classification of Insincere Questions in Quora Using Deep Learning Approaches","N. Ahamed; S. Ahangama","Department of Information Technology, University of Moratuwa, Katubedda, Sri Lanka; Department of Information Technology, University of Moratuwa, Katubedda, Sri Lanka",2023 IEEE 17th International Conference on Industrial and Information Systems (ICIIS),"20 Sep 2023","2023","","","1","6","The rise of online question-and-answer platforms like Quora and Stack Overflow has transformed knowledge acquisition, offering a vast repository of collective information. However, this has also led to the proliferation of insincere questions, which lack a neutral undertone and are not intended for learning. The posting of such queries can lead to chaos, necessitating the need for monitoring and discerning which questions should be published to maintain the platform's quality. The classification of insincere questions is crucial for maintaining the quality of these platforms. Detecting insincere questions can enhance user experience and foster a healthy and safe environment for online discussions. While Quora previously relied on manual reviews, the application of algorithms, particularly those from the field of Deep Learning, a subset of Machine Learning, has made this process more efficient and accessible. This paper reviews various approaches and algorithms used in classifying insincere questions on Quora, their benefits, and drawbacks. It provides insights into how Deep Learning can enhance the accuracy and effectiveness of insincere question classification on online platforms. The review findings indicate that class imbalance is a common issue in this type of research, highlighting the need for further exploration in future work.","2164-7011","979-8-3503-2363-4","10.1109/ICIIS58898.2023.10253595","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10253595","Text Classification;Deep Learning;Convolutional Neural Network;Quora;Insincere;Sincere;Machine Learning;Question","","","","","29","IEEE","20 Sep 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
