This diversity makes the service selection a challenging task, especially when numerous qualities of service criteria and range of providers are considered. To address this problem, this study first presents a consensus-based service assessment methodology that utilizes consensus theory to evaluate the service behavior for single QoS criteria using the power of crowdsourcing. To this end, trust level metrics are introduced to measure the strength of a consensus based on the trustworthiness levels of crowd members. The peers converged to the most trustworthy evaluation. Next, the fuzzy inference engine was used to aggregate each obtained assessed QoS value based on user preferences because we address multiple QoS criteria in real life scenarios. The proposed approach was tested and illustrated via two case studies that prove its applicability.","","978-1-4799-5066-9","10.1109/SCC.2014.12","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6930512","Web service;Consensus;Trust;Service selection;Fuzzy aggregation","Quality of service;Monitoring;Peer-to-peer computing;Measurement;Fuzzy logic;Engines;Convergence","","5","","37","IEEE","20 Oct 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

An SDI is developed essentially as an open service platform, in which a loosely coupled system connects users and applications with data sources with a high level of substitutability of components. Development of regional or national SDIs, however, follows a top-down approach that is often governed by laws and directives. Alternatively, Crowdsourcing emerged as a mechanism for contributing data voluntarily. Our work aims to support the future design of open service platforms to enable national and international volunteers to generate, revise, correct, and analyze Georeferenced metadata and data of the Georeferenced content of libraries, archives and museums related to cultural heritage. Such a platform will exploit the strengths of current SDI services, and will positively influence the robustness of current digital libraries and archives. For this work, we wanted to deploy the implementation guidelines of SDIs. Here, we report on our first prototype, which achieves content management loosely through an OGC-compliant wrapper implementation, and we discuss the prospect for more mature, probably INSPIREd, services, in the context of our services framework for information management of Crowdsourced content in the domain of cultural heritage.","","978-1-7281-3430-7","10.1109/INFOMAN.2019.8714670","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8714670","SaaS;Web services;Catalogues;Cultural heritage;Geocomputation","Metadata;Libraries;Web services;Cultural differences;Standards;Geospatial analysis;Spatial databases","","5","","18","IEEE","16 May 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Most of the existing approaches assume that the task and candidate knowledge is known in advance and ignore the effect of enrolled candidates' willingness on the CS system's selection decision. For instance, an unwilling candidate assigned to a task may quit without completing it, thus depreciating the utility of the CS platform. In practice, a task or candidate may arrive or leave the CS system dynamically. Moreover, a complex task may be broken into smaller sub-tasks, each requiring a variety of computations and expertise. To overcome these challenges, based on a greedy algorithm, we propose a novel approach for skill-oriented dynamic task allocation with willingness factor for complex assignments (SWill-TAC). This approach iteratively attempts to delegate candidates (workers) to tasks depending on the skills required for executing the tasks and the candidates' skill set. SWill-TAC also considers the willingness of eligible candidates and keeps track of the budget constraints of tasks. Finally, the feasibility and efficiency of our approach are demonstrated using the UpWork dataset. Experimental results show that SWill-TAC outperforms Online Greedy, TM-Uniform, Random selection-based, and Minimum payment-based task allocations in terms of the completed tasks count, the utility gained, and success ratio.","","978-1-7281-8104-2","10.1109/GLOBECOM46510.2021.9685885","NSF(grant numbers:1725755,2104078); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9685885","Crowdsourcing;Skill-oriented;Willingness;Dynamic Task Allocation;Greedy Approach","Crowdsourcing;Greedy algorithms;Heuristic algorithms;Conferences;Dynamic scheduling;Resource management;Global communication","","5","","23","IEEE","2 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this work, we study such an MEC scenario, where mobile devices at edge share their heterogeneous resources with each other, hence forming a multi-dimensional resource crowdsourcing (sharing) framework. We are interested in the problem of how to optimally offload tasks to mobile devices under this framework, aiming at minimizing the total energy cost and maximizing the overall task completion. To study the problem, we first propose a general task model, where each task is divided into multiple sequential subtasks according to their functionalities as well as resource requirements. Then, based on the task model, we propose a Joint Energy Consumption and Task Failure Probability Minimization Problem, which decides when and where each subtask will be offloaded to. The problem is challenging to solve, mainly due to the inherent constraints between the scheduling of different subtasks. Therefore, we propose several linearization methods to relax the constraints, and convert the original problem into an integer linear programming (ILP), which can be solved by many classic methods effectively. We further perform simulations, which show that our proposed solution outperforms the existing solutions (with indivisible tasks or without resource sharing) in terms of both the total cost and the task failure probability. Precisely, our proposed solution can reduce the total cost by 25%~85% and the task failure probability by 10%~35%.","1938-1883","978-1-7281-5089-5","10.1109/ICC40277.2020.9148952","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9148952","","Task analysis;Mobile handsets;Device-to-device communication;Resource management;Energy consumption;Downlink;Uplink","","4","","16","IEEE","27 Jul 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Applications providing navigation support to users are rendered useless without a map of the vicinity being available. Presently, floorplans of public locations are collected and maintained by designated organizations using methods that require excessive manual intervention. This process of creating a database of indoor maps is neither efficient nor scalable to the practically infinite number of public indoor places around the world. In this paper, we present a crowdsourcing algorithm to automatically create floorplans of buildings with zero prior information. The algorithm leverages the positioning data shared by pedestrians using smartphone-based navigation systems in the building. It expects only position fixes and associated uncertainties from the navigation systems and does not depend on any particular navigation algorithm. The available positioning data in a completely unknown building is essentially PDR-based and is known to be prone to high amounts of accumulated error primarily due to the lack of reliable error resetting techniques. The presented algorithm takes into account the possibility of such highly erroneous motion traces of pedestrians while trying to generate map as accurately as possible. As an added merit, the algorithm does not depend on the availability of Wi-Fi access points.","","978-1-4673-8054-6","10.1109/IPIN.2014.7275499","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7275499","","Kernel;Indoor navigation;Uncertainty;Buildings;Histograms;Covariance matrices","","4","1","14","IEEE","28 Sep 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, without proper guidance, participants may not always collect data from desired locations with a required Quality-of-Information (QoI). This often causes either a lack of data in certain areas, or extra overheads for processing unnecessary redundancy. In this work, we propose SnapTask, a participatory VCS system that aims at creating complete indoor maps by guiding participants to efficiently collect visual data of high QoI. It applies Structure-from-Motion (SfM) techniques to reconstruct 3D models of indoor environments, which are then converted into indoor maps. To increase coverage with minimal redundancy, SnapTask determines locations for the next data collection tasks by analyzing the coverage of the generated 3D model and the camera views of the collected images. In addition, it overcomes the limitations of SfM techniques by utilizing crowdsourced annotations to reconstruct featureless surfaces (e.g. glass walls) in the 3D model. According to a field test in a library, the indoor map generated by SnapTask successfully reconstructs 100% of the library walls and 98.12% of objects and traversal areas within the library.

Unlike other systems proposed in the past, we filter information sources to check for crowdsourcing feasibility and then assess the drug's effectiveness based on its reported detrimental effect on a patient. This helps in eliminating certain drugs that would almost certainly have an adverse effect on the patient's health and thereby obtain a set of recommendable drugs. These recommendations are further refined by analyzing the sentiment behind the opinions of patients who have been administered these drugs in the past. The resultant set of prescribable drugs agrees with those suggested by the consulted physicians for the considered sample set of diabetes patients. The critical assessment of the prototype system for Diabetes Type II drugs by both doctors and patients also reiterates the need for a feedback system that can possibly go a long way in improving patient experience of a drug. This leads us to conclude that PeopleSave, as a combination of the recommendation system prototype and the proposed feedback system, can be successful in improving the process of prescription of medicines for a varied range of medical conditions.","2155-2509","978-1-4673-9622-6","10.1109/COMSNETS.2016.7440000","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7440000","","Drugs;Medical diagnostic imaging;Portals;Diabetes;Sentiment analysis","","3","","18","IEEE","24 Mar 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To do so, the activity log of the user under investigation is considered and his/her attention at previous intervals is analyzed. Another novel point of the proposed approach is the incorporation of friends' attention into the relevance feedback scheme. In particular, interactions among users and posted multimedia items are considered as an explicit crowdsourcing activity. By this way some multimedia items receive more attention, while some others receive less or no attention. By analyzing these social interactions, a social computing framework is formed, which affects the evolution of the content selection process. Overall, the iterative relevance feedback algorithm takes into consideration visual features, activity log and social attention, in order to select the wall information of each social media user.

With evolving information and communication technologies (ICT) and the internet of things (IoT), novel and customized business models emerged, moving toward decentralized network systems where individuals (peer-to-peer) may participate in the so-called crowdsourcing. This paper focuses particularly on the delivery of products in crowd shipping, creating a delivery service through crowd usage. A generic business model for applications in crowd shipping is addressed, whereby we proposed a crowd shipping delivery model, that utilizes commercial airplanes for low weight packages (below 1 Kg). The responsiveness is advantageous for the continuous flight schedules, while the lightweight involves more travelers for facilitating the delivery of products.

In this paper, we propose a crowdsourcing based search approach named CrowdAPS to effectively find the appropriate APIs. Specifically, CrowdAPS leverages Twitter lists, which is a tool used by individual users to organize accounts that interest them on semantics. List meta-data, including list name and description, is generated from collective intelligence and can be used by Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) model to acquire semantic similarity between APIs and queries. Furthermore, CrowdAPS exploits list number to infer the popularity of APIs. The final search result relies on the integration of semantic similarity and popularity.

Typically fingerprinting localization is realized, which requires a site survey process where radio signatures of a localization area are annotated with their actual recorded locations. The site survey is time-consuming and labor-intensive that intensifies practical limits and challenges in realizing a reliable and scalable IPS. In this paper, we propose a crowdsourcing-based approach to acquire the training data set for Gaussian process regression (GPR). In particular, we suggest combining access point (AP) proximity information and pedestrian dead reckoning (PDR) to collect labeled data without any human intervention. The crowdsourced training data are fed to model a Gaussian process, which predicts the mean RSS and its corresponding variance across the testbed. To validate the proposed method, we compared the predicted data with the manually measured one and utilized the predicted data for localization using weighted k-nearest neighbor (Wk-NN) and maximum likelihood (ML) based fingerprinting localization. Experimental results obtained by real field deployment show that the average difference between the predicted RSS and manually measured RSS is 3.87 dBm and 80% of the localization estimation error are below 5.5m.","2471-917X","978-1-7281-1788-1","10.1109/IPIN.2019.8911776","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8911776","Bluetooth low energy;fingerprinting localization;gaussian process regression;and pedestrian dead reckoning","Training data;Ground penetrating radar;Crowdsourcing;IP networks;Wireless fidelity;Gaussian processes;Data models","","3","","20","IEEE","28 Nov 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The design of the incentive mechanism in VBC is necessary because the amount of the sensing tasks accomplished depend on the scale and the willingness of the participants. In general, every sensing task has two dimensions, which are the time dimension and place dimension. That is to say, each task in VBC corresponds to different Places of Interest(PoIs) and time slot. However, most of the existing incentive mechanisms only allow users to enter the system one by one without considering both the two characteristics of the sensing task, only take into account the user's margin contribution value rather than the margin contribution ratio. On the contrary, we fully consider the user's margin contribution ratio, which takes into account the system's requirements for the task and the ability of the user to do the task. In addition, our mechanism can be effectively applied to a time-sensitive task scenario. In this paper, we propose an online incentive mechanism, RIM, with the properties: truthfulness, budget feasible, computational efficiency, individual rationality, consumer sovereignty.

They target business growth by increasing their efficiencies, by improving their internal operations and/or delivering novel value-added products and services. This is not easy to accomplish, as it requires defining a new strategy, changing the way of working, training and engaging employees and interacting with the customers to address different global trends.One major challenge companies are facing is how to shift to collaboratively designing new services enabled by digital technologies, integrating talent from an ecosystem of experts. To design new services, organizations can start by reflecting on how they currently execute their innovation process. This latter is all about transforming ideas, data and knowledge into products or services launched successfully to the market. To accelerate their performance, organizations have been changing their practices, from working exclusively in-house to openly collaborating with external talent. Crowdsourcing refers to the necessary activities to collect “out-of-the-box” ideas in order to benefit from the collective brainpower of diverse entrepreneurial individuals and/or their own employees. A Hackathon could be defined as a crowd-sourcing contest, in which a diverse talented crowd is asked to solve a business challenge within 1 to 2 days and only the winners receive compensation or an award. Although hackathons originally focused on coding, lately organizations have been increasingly organizing them to solve business challenges while applying customer-centric approaches such as Design Thinking. This paper provides the foundations to link these approaches and provide insights about a hackathon that enabled innovation experts from different organizations to provide their ideas and identify key services to be delivered by an innovation hub.","","978-1-7281-7177-7","10.1109/SDS49233.2020.00009","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9145024","crowdsourcing;hackathon;innovation;design thinking;service design","Technological innovation;Crowdsourcing;Companies;Prototypes;Acceleration","","3","","31","IEEE","21 Jul 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Yet ranked lists offer the most informative knowledge for training and testing in various data mining and information retrieval tasks such as learning to rank. In this paper, we propose a novel generative model called ""Thurstonian Pairwise Preference"" (TPP) to infer the true ranked list out of a collection of crowdsourced pairwise annotations. The key challenges that TPP addresses are to resolve the inevitable incompleteness and inconsistency of judgements, as well as to model variable query difficulty and different labeling quality resulting from workers' domain expertise and truthfulness.

Various truth analysis techniques have been proposed to identify truth from the noisy data either in a heuristic manner or using statistical models. However, if the available data are limited or have large conflicts, it is difficult to identify the truth or ensure the data credibility (quality). In this paper, we address this problem by utilizing the communication networks to adaptively collect data from mobile users, especially when the existing data are not enough to ensure data credibility. Considering the requirement on data credibility and the constraint of network resources, we quantify the tradeoff between the enhanced data credibility and the increased network overhead, and propose resource-aware approaches for truth analysis. Specifically, we formalize two problems in resource-constrained mobile opportunistic networks: max-credibility which aims to maximize data credibility with some network overhead, and min-overhead which aims to achieve a specified data credibility while minimizing the network overhead. Simulation and experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed solutions in terms of data credibility and network overhead.","2155-6814","978-1-5090-2833-7","10.1109/MASS.2016.014","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7815008","","Mobile communication;Mobile computing;Reliability;Sensors;Servers;Estimation error;Crowdsourcing","","2","","21","IEEE","16 Jan 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This work combines crowdsourcing and gamification to leverage human intelligence, enhancing the object recognition and attribute estimation aspects of robot perception. The framework employs an attribute matching system that encodes visual information into an online puzzle game, utilizing the collective intelligence of players to expand an initial attribute database and react to real-time perception conflicts.

At the same time, we know that misinformation is easily detectable by a certain few, very skeptical, or very informed users. In this study, we demonstrate how blending artificial intelligence and human skills can create a new paradigm for credibility prediction. The crowdsourcing part of the detection mechanism is implemented implicitly, by simply observing the natural interaction between users encountering the messages. Specifically, we explore the spread of information on Twitter at the microscopic (user-to-user propagation) level and propose a model that predicts if a message is True or False by observing the latent attributes of the message, along with those of the users interacting with it, and their reactions to the message. We demonstrate the application of this model to the detection of misinformation and rank the relevant message and user features that are most critical in influencing the spread of rumor over the network.

Nevertheless, most of the current researches on this problem assume that the system should get the entire information about the participants. As a result, the suitable tasks are always not allocated to the suitable participants. This practice contributes an inaccurate match between a task and participants, which leads to energy and incentives waste. In view of this challenge, we aim to select participants under a more accurate prediction model, rather than assuming that the information of each participant should be obtained in advance. The prediction model is enabled by the big data of participants' historic evaluation, which are used to predict the user action. Furthermore, a greedy method based on an improved singular value decomposition (SVD), named as SVD_G, is proposed to solve this problem.

The kind of tasks are composite and called Composite Tasks (CTs) , which are said to be completed and return reward only after all of their sub-tasks are finished successfully. Meanwhile, users may have various capabilities to implement diverse sub-tasks (STs) with corresponding cost so users are heterogeneous. In this paper, we study the problem of how users choose the STs to maximize their payoff (reward minus cost) when there are multiple such CTs. This payoff maximization problem with multiple CTs and heterogeneous users turns out to be NP-completed. We then propose a Local Composite Task Selection (LCTS) algorithm to help the users choose their subtask strategies. Its convergence and complexity are analyzed theoretically. For comparison, we design a centralized Composite Task Selection (CTS) algorithm and a Low Cost and Random sub-task selection (LCR) algorithm as benchmarks. Numerical results suggest that the LCTS algorithm achieves a similar payoff and task completion ratio to the CTS when the number of users is large. The performance of LCTS is highly over LCR on both of the payoff and the task completion ratio. The results also illustrate the quick convergence of the LCTS algorithm.","2155-5494","978-1-5090-6599-8","10.1109/SAHCN.2017.7964917","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7964917","","Crowdsourcing;Sensors;Algorithm design and analysis;Games;Complexity theory;Benchmark testing;Approximation algorithms","","2","","21","IEEE","3 Jul 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Our problem is motivated by the limitations of current fairness approaches that only focus on a single human face dataset from a particular application and require a large amount of pre-annotated demographic attribute labels to develop fair human facial models. To address these limitations, we develop ExgFair, a crowdsourcing-based fair data exchange framework to generate a set of augmented fair face image datasets by leveraging the crowdsourced demographic attribute labels of human face images. We evaluate ExgFair using a set of real-world human face image datasets with different demographic distributions.

In particular, new technologies such as robocalling systems have been a new resource of harassment. Traditional approaches in detecting such activities simply rely on the construction of blacklisting number systems. However, criminals can easily masquerade their phone numbers simply by changing their numbers through VoIP (Voice over IP) or use virtual mobile numbers (VMN) with relatively low pricing, laxed ID checks and high-level API automation. In this paper, we present a novel situation-enabled approach to blacklist unwanted phone numbers while keeping high detection rate through distributed crowd sourcing. The system consists of two parts. First, we collect a user’s daily schedule in time series as situational data and use the data to train Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) deep learning model. This model is used to predict the user’s situation in the future. Then, we implement a semi-automatic tagging application to tag each incoming call by reading the call history against the predicted situation. An incoming phone number can be automatically tagged as malicious if it is in a wrong situation or could be benign otherwise. A user is also allowed to manually change the tagging afterwards if it is necessary. Second, a distributed crowdsourcing is used to aggregate highly ranked calling numbers from different devices in the same area. When a higher-level blacklist has been built, it can be used to update local ones by propagating back to end user devices with edge local blacklist and edge foreign blacklist. A simple evaluation has been made against real incoming calls on Android phones. The results show that our system design can attain decent detection rates.","","978-1-7281-7624-6","10.1109/CSCI51800.2020.00146","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9457920","Situation;Blacklisting;Scam;Edge Computing;Long Short Term Memory (LSTM);Crowd Sourcing","Crowdsourcing;Image edge detection;Aggregates;System performance;Time series analysis;Tagging;Blacklisting","","2","","10","IEEE","23 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Complex tasks are decomposed into interdependent subtasks that can be executed cooperatively by individual workers. In the case of sequential tasks, the output of a task becomes the input to another task, and the quality of the final artifact thus depends on the qualities of the preceding tasks. In crowdsourcing, the abilities of workers are often difficult to learn in advance. Thus, a fixed budget allocation for the component subtasks cannot deal with a dynamic situation. Also, it is often difficult for a requester to accurately evaluate the quality of intermediate artifacts, which can result in budget misallocation and waste. To overcome these difficulties, we formalize the budget allocation problem as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) by introducing quality evaluation actions and developing a contingent budget allocation method, which generates a conditional plan given uncertainty about the intermediate states and action effects.

To improve the quality of the ranking service, we propose a Privacy- Preserving Adaptive Ranking algorithm called PPAR, which can solve the problem with a high probability while differential privacy can be ensured. The total cost of the proposed algorithm is ${\mathcal{O}}(K\ln K)$, which is near optimal compared with the trivial lower bound Ω(K), where K is the number of arms. Our proposed algorithm can also be used to solve the well-studied fully ranking problem and the best arm identification problem, by proper setting the granularity parameter.

Currently, there are three types of monitoring approaches: government-led monitoring, Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) approaches and Participatory Urban Sensing (PUS). There are three limitations in these state-of-the-art research approaches: a) the coarse-grained limitation of government-led monitoring, b) the deployment and maintenance cost of WSN approaches, c) the ""Black Hole"" problem and the ""Black Time Window"" problem of PMTI-based approaches in PUS. How to overcome these three main limitations is the biggest challenge. To address these limitations, we need a new way to collect PM2.5 data. Nowadays, IoT (Internet of Things) smart devices sold to various customers could steadily and directly collect the PM2.5 data in vast urban areas, but how to obtain wide-spread real PM2.5 data from tens of thousands of smart devices is another challenge. While no existing work has addressed these two challenges, how to address them is an open problem. In this paper, we propose PMViewer, a novel PUS approach to address these two challenges. PMViewer's data are collected from tens of thousands of smart devices called AirBox through a crowdsourcing approach. We aim to offer a fine-grained spatial-temporal resolution for the public to monitor the urban PM2.5 pollution near their locations. PMViewer scrawls data from AirBox's vendor server and parses the data to generate a map view to display real-time urban PM2.5 measurements. In this study, we design, implement and evaluate PMViewer. Evaluation results show that PMViewer efficiently and economically addressed these two challenges described above.","2155-6814","978-1-5386-2324-4","10.1109/MASS.2017.44","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8108761","","Servers;Monitoring;Air quality;Crowdsourcing;Wireless sensor networks;Smart devices;Pollution measurement","","1","","15","IEEE","16 Nov 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, it is often infeasible to get experts to label all of this data, which leads many practitioners to crowdsourcing solutions. In this paper, we present new techniques to improve the quality of the labels while attempting to reduce the cost. The naive approach to assigning labels is to adopt a majority vote method, however, in the context of data labelling, this is not always ideal as data labellers are not equally reliable. One might, instead, give higher priority to certain labellers through some kind of weighted vote based on past performance. This paper investigates the use of more sophisticated methods, such as Bayesian inference, to measure the performance of the labellers as well as the confidence of each label. The methods we propose follow an iterative improvement algorithm which attempts to use the least amount of workers necessary to achieve the desired confidence in the inferred label. This paper explores simulated binary classification problems with simulated workers and questions to test the proposed methods. Our methods outperform the standard voting methods in both cost and accuracy while maintaining higher reliability when there is disagreement within the crowd.","","978-1-7281-4162-6","10.1109/SAUPEC/RobMech/PRASA48453.2020.9041099","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9041099","Crowdsourcing;Maximum Likelihood;Bayesian Inference;Inter-rater Agreement;Consensus","Crowdsourcing;Costs;Machine learning;Iterative algorithms;Inference algorithms;Bayes methods;Classification algorithms","","1","","13","IEEE","19 Mar 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The aim from such hybridity is to support human tasks. For example, TopCoder could be used to develop hybrid computing elements to be used in crowdsourcing software. Developing human-based computing elements is a more complex process than developing machine-based computing elements, as the task must be ""structured"" well as the Turing machines. This leads to the most difficult question of the ""unknown unknown"" requirements and having to deal with more macro-sociological factors on tasks than formal languages usually work with. In this paper, we model the hybridity using two types of computing elements: the humanbased, with whatever purposes the crowd envision, and the machine-based, which is used to develop it. We present a new framework to help provide such hybridity. It identifies the underlying building-blocks by using a biological metaphor. We call these building-blocks the ""genes"" of collective intelligence systems, the conditions under which each gene is useful, and the possibilities for combining and re-combining these genes to harness crowds effectively. Employing an analogy from biology where the operator relating the crowd and the parameter to be social phenomena is assumed to belong to semi-algebraic sets.

To build more accurate Wi-Fi positioning system (WPS), a more precise radio map should be prepared in advance. Despite GPS signals are usually unreachable in most indoor venues, GPS signals are commonly used as reference locations to tag the collected fingerprints. As a result, WPS has not been able to achieve high performance in accuracy indoors, even if the place is rich in Wi-Fi signals. This paper introduces a novel method to construct a radio map without any use of GPS signals. Users' home or office address is used instead to tag the locations of collected Wi-Fi signals. Since the method utilizes Wi-Fi signals collected indoors, a more precise radio map construction is possible. For evaluation, we tested the method at four deliberately selected residential and downtown areas in Daejeon and Seoul, Korea. Once the data collection rate rises above 50%, the average error distance was within 10m or less. This indicates that address-based crowdsourcing radio map construction can be an effective means to construct global-scale but precise radio maps at low cost.","","978-1-4673-8054-6","10.1109/IPIN.2014.7275468","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7275468","Indoor localization;WLAN;Crowdsourcing","Fingerprint recognition;Buildings;Global Positioning System;Smart phones;IEEE 802.11 Standard;Tagging;Indoor navigation","","1","","25","IEEE","28 Sep 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Nevertheless, we propose one with a profound crowdsourcing scheme that addresses the drawback by merging the paths of different leaders' into a global map. To realize the idea, we further deal with entailed challenges, namely the unidirectional disadvantage, the scale ambiguity, and large computational overhead. We design a navigation strategy to solve the unidirectional problem and turn to VIO to tackle scale ambiguity. We devise a mobile-edge architecture to enable real-time navigation (30fps, 100ms end-to-end delay) and lighten the burden of smartphones (35% battery life for 2h35min) while assuring the accuracy of localization and map construction. Through experimental validations, we show that P2P navigation, previously relying on the abundance of independent paths, can enjoy a sufficiency of navigation paths with a crowdsourced global map.

On the other hand, the SC server usually intends to finish all tasks with a low cost. Considering these factors, in this paper, we study a Bi-Objective Task Planning (BOTP) problem in SC, where the workers are assigned and scheduled to perform the appropriate tasks, such that the workers' familiarity with the locations of the spatial tasks and the SC server's cost for recruiting workers are jointly optimized.

However, regional local governments have neither the resources nor the appropriate tools needed to understand and respond to the infrastructure needs of older persons. As mobile devices such as tablets and phones proliferate, there is an opportunity to use mobile apps to engage older people more effectively with their local government associations in planning the future of their regional city centres. In this paper we discuss the potential of this application for crowdsourcing older people's opinions as a form of community engagement. The application was developed in partnership with the Local Government Association and the partnership of the two regional local governments who participated in our pilot. We begin by describing the architecture of our platform, addressing choices regarding user interface design, modes and models for data capture, and standards guidelines.

The performance of tasks assignment is generally evaluated by the makespan. However, not only the makespan, but also the quality of performed tasks is important. Therefore, in this paper, we propose two task assignment schemes. One is the quality-aware task assignment (QA-TA) that tries to maximize the quality of tasks for given a deadline; the other is the minimum quality threshold task assignment (MQT-TA) that tries to minimize the makespan for a given minimum quality requirement. To this end, we apply the optimal stopping, which is one of the widely used techniques in mathematics, to the algorithm designs. The simulations using real mobility traces demonstrates that the proposed schemes successfully achieve their design goals.","2374-9628","978-1-5386-6808-5","10.1109/PCCC.2018.8711306","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8711306","Task assignment;Mobile crowdsourcing;quality-aware;optimal stopping","Task analysis;Crowdsourcing;Mathematical model;Time-frequency analysis;Wireless fidelity;Ad hoc networks","","1","","17","IEEE","13 May 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper reports the results of the assessment of the quality and quantity of OpenStreetMap mountain information: different types of information and world regions have different gaps and improvement requirements. To address this issue, we propose a hybrid approach, in which an open Digital Elevation Model data set is processed with a heuristic algorithm to find candidate mountain information and uncertainty in the automatically extracted candidates is reduced by means of voluntary expert crowdsourcing.

This paper describes an experimental crowdsourcing system to evaluate the potential improvement in situation assessment resulting from the fusion of hard and soft data. The paper then applies a new combination of Bayesian inference algorithms, Particle Filtering and Softmax learning, to a canonical test problem: tracking a single moving object moving along a road network. The fusion of soft reports with intermittent hard data is shown to yield a marked improvement in situation assessment performance. Key to achieving such gains in practice will be appropriate incentives to reward trustworthy reporters along with methods to reduce sensitivity to any remaining untrustworthy reports.","","978-1-4799-0284-2","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6641345","crowdsourcing;tracking;fusion;uncertainty;trust","Sensors;Roads;Data integration;Noise;Bayes methods;Data models;Training data","","1","","22","","21 Oct 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) ensures this by providing a system for digital certificates that authenticate the identities of entities involved, securing data and command transmissions between drones and their operators. However, the centralized trust model of traditional PKI, dependent on Certificate Authorities (CAs), presents a vulnerability due to its single point of failure, risking security breaches. To counteract this, the paper presents D2XChain, a blockchain-based PKI framework designed for the Internet of Drone Things (IoDT). By decentralizing the CA infrastructure, D2XChain eliminates this single point of failure, thereby enhancing the security and reliability of drone communications. Fully compatible with the X.509 standard, it integrates seamlessly with existing PKI systems, supporting all key operations such as certificate registration, validation, verification, and revocation in a distributed manner. This innovative approach not only strengthens the defense of drone services against various security threats but also showcases its practical application through deployment on a private Ethereum testbed, representing a significant advancement in addressing the unique security challenges of drone-based services and ensuring their trustworthy operation in critical tasks.","2836-3868","979-8-3503-6855-0","10.1109/ICWS62655.2024.00084","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10707566","Data Integrity;Decentralized Trust;Public Key Infrastructure;Spatial Crowdsourcing;Certificate Authority","Crowdsourcing;Web services;Surveillance;Smart contracts;Public key;Spatial databases;Security;Trust management;Standards;Drones","","1","","41","IEEE","15 Oct 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

QuickSketch employs multiple vehicles equipped with 3D sensors (stereo cameras) to explore different areas of an unknown territory and then combines 3D data from all the vehicles to build a single 3D map. QuickSketch annotates the 3D map with important landmarks and enables rapid contextualization of visual intelligence (photos) received from first responders and disaster victims to guarantee timely backup and rescue operations.

Prior research has found that although students learn more from active learning activities, they do not feel like they are learning more, which can have a detrimental impact to their satisfaction with the activity and the course. Studies have found that with more training and promotion, students' attitudes can change; however, this takes additional time and effort which instructors and students can find discouraging. Our research reports on the experience of using a crowdsourcing activity to create exam questions.

Compared with traditional centralized data collecting methods, obtaining environmental data by distributed “crowds” can largely reduce the cost. However, designing such crowdsourcing systems requires an appropriate incentive mechanism to encourage providing accurate and rare environmental data. In this paper, we propose to utilize blockchain-based incentive mechanisms to address the problem. We design and evaluate a blockchain-based system for large scale environmental data acquisition, which consists of a sensor layer to collect distributed environmental data, a valuation layer to evaluate the quality of the data collected, a consensus layer to incentive and motivate high quality data collection, and a ledger layer to record the incentive transactions and the qualified environmental data. The incentive mechanism in the consensus layer is achieved with a Proof-of-Data-Value (PODV) protocol adapted from the Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) [11] consensus algorithm. We carry out experiments to compare the PODV with contemporary blockchain census protocols including Proof-of-Work (POW) [16] and Proof-of-Stake (POS)[18]. The experimental results show that the proposed system outperforms in encouraging crowds to provide accurate and rare environmental data, and imply that the PODV are superior in terms of throughput and environmental friendliness.","","978-1-7281-6597-4","10.1109/CSCWD49262.2021.9437882","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9437882","environmental data acquisition;crowdsourcing system;blockchain;incentive mechanism","Crowdsourcing;Protocols;Scalability;Data acquisition;Distributed databases;Blockchain;Throughput","","1","","18","IEEE","28 May 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For instance, a task based on reviews of a product can be degraded when malicious users copy each other with minimal edits of the review, giving a misrepresentation of the true quality of the product. More specifically, we investigate the case where different malicious crowd sizes cooperate on different tasks, known as overlapping groups. Such sophisticated and hard to detect malicious crowds provide unfair evaluations and misleading results to the crowdsourcers.

In this paper, we introduce the pattern of armed reconnaissance in urban operations and summarize Few Squads-More Tasks (FSMT) as the problem of mobile crowd sourcing one-to-many task allocation. Then, we treat the problem as a Multiple Traveling Salesman Problem (MTSP) model of multiple starting points, which is solved by maximizing the number of reconnaissance tasks under the constraints of reconnaissance squad distances. To find the solutions, we propose the cluster partitioning and improved genetics based Two-Stage Heuristic Algorithm (TSHA).

Existing error correction approaches often suffer accuracy loss when the hybrid reads present diversity or the coverage varies. In this paper, we propose a novel method based on crowdsourcing strategy, which is implemented as CLTC. CLTC is also a hybrid correction algorithm, which consists of four steps. The second generation reads are first collected and mapped to the third generation reads. Then, the base difficult level is defined to describe the diversities on a base among a group of 2nd-generation reads covered it. The capability is evaluated for each 2nd-generation read, which considers the base difficult levels across the read, the consistency among overlapped reads and the mapping quality between the 2nd- and 3rd-generation reads. A heuristic algorithm is designed for the calculation of capabilities. An expectation-maximization algorithm is finally used to compute the corrected result for each base-pair. We test CLTC on different datasets and compare to the existing approaches. The results demonstrate that CLTC is able to achieve higher accuracy and performs faster than the existing ones.","","978-1-5090-3050-7","10.1109/BIBM.2017.8217903","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8217903","third generation sequencing data;sequencing error;error correction method;hybrid crowdsourcing algorithm","Sequential analysis;Genomics;Crowdsourcing;Algorithm design and analysis;Bioinformatics;Error correction;Mathematical model","","","","20","IEEE","18 Dec 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To address these challenges, this paper provides a new and effective annotation method in which the annotator no longer just provides annotations, but also plays the role of a reviewer to review the annotation results of other annotators. This method focuses on surveillance video data, in addition, it also supports adding additional custom tasks (e.g., action tagging, person relationship recognition, video summarization, etc.). And in this paper we mainly consider the additional custom temporal action annotation task. In this paper, we develop rules for filtering frames or segments that need to be re-labeled based on the temporal information of the model inference results and rely on the correlation between target and time to determine the task relevance, and asynchronously assign the task to different annotators for and dynamically portray the ability of the annotators while annotation is in progress, so as to allocate tasks to achieve annotation and mutual review of annotators. We have experimentally demonstrated that this method can reduce costs and improve labeling accuracy.","","978-1-6654-7384-2","10.1109/BigCom57025.2022.00055","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10064394","Object annotation;tracking;task assignment","Crowdsourcing;Costs;Correlation;Annotations;Surveillance;Manuals;Tagging","","","","26","IEEE","20 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To ensure service quality, the VCS service provider prefers to assign multi-location tasks to the workers whose future trajectories have high spatial proximity with the task locations. However, this process requires workers and task owners to upload their precise locations to a not-fully-trusted service provider, thereby raising location privacy concerns. Although several privacy-preserving trajectory similarity evaluation schemes have been proposed, they either fail to match the multi-location task allocation scenario, or incur nontrivial computational costs due to homomorphic encryption. To address these challenges, we propose a novel efficient privacy-preserving multi-location task allocation scheme in fog-assisted VCS. Specifically, we design a lightweight secure Euclidean distance computation protocol based on arithmetic secret sharing (ASS), which can compute Euclidean distance without revealing the two input locations. Then, based on this protocol, we build our scheme that supports multi-location task allocation based on Hausdorff semi-distance (HSD). Our security analysis demonstrates the location privacy preservation of our scheme, and the experiment results on a real dataset also validate the efficiency of our scheme.","1938-1883","978-1-7281-9054-9","10.1109/ICC51166.2024.10623008","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61871290); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10623008","Vehicular crowdsourcing;privacy preservation;task allocation;secret sharing","Crowdsourcing;Privacy;Data privacy;Protocols;Euclidean distance;Trajectory;Computational efficiency","","","","8","IEEE","20 Aug 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Most of the existing researches only carry out algorithm design on the premise of fully determining the scene information. However, due to the interference of many factors in the real scene, information such as workers and task costs in the scene is usually not completely uncertain. To solve the above problems, a spatial crowdsourcing task pricing algorithm is proposed. Firstly, the algorithm uses the proposed dimension-up gray wolf algorithm and support vector regression(DU_GWO-SVR) to predict the task price, and then sets the price based on the obtained price. In order to solve the instability of average price and matching number caused by dynamic supply and demand, an adjustment mechanism is designed to stabilize the average price of tasks. The experiment uses a real data set-the New York taxi data set, and compares it with the classic greedy algorithm and binary matching algorithm. The experimental results show that the matching rate of the proposed algorithm is above 75% when the scene information is not completely uncertain.","2577-1655","979-8-3503-3702-0","10.1109/SMC53992.2023.10393968","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10393968","task pricing;binary matching;self-assignment;uncertain information;incomplete information","Crowdsourcing;Support vector machines;Uncertainty;Supply and demand;Heuristic algorithms;Pricing;Prediction algorithms","","","","22","IEEE","29 Jan 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Furthermore, these approaches fail to address the potential threats arising from continuously disclosing location information during the execution of various sensing tasks. To address these issues, it becomes essential to maintain a comprehensive historical record of workers who have performed diverse sensing tasks and leverage this historical information to accurately quantify location-privacy disclosure. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that integrates blockchain technology to enhance privacy protection in MCS. We investigate how an attacker could infer the true location by exploiting noisy location data shared on the blockchain, along with their basic knowledge of users and frequently visited places.

To address this issue, this paper proposes a new network paradigm where potential small cell sites are encouraged to participate in facilitating HetNet deployment. This idea is inspired by the emerging phenomena of crowdsourcing, a distributed problem-solving approach tapping into the potential of a large and open crowd for a specific goal. In the proposed scheme, we let Donor eNB (DeNB) of existing marco cell be a crowdsourcers who would announce some transmission tasks to potential distributed small cell sites (belonging to individual or third-party community), when the existing network cannot shoulder users requirements. As for the recruited small cell sites, they help the DeNB through relay transmission mode. In order to stimulate more third-party small cell participating in such a paradigm, we proposed an incentive mechanism by using game theory. Moreover, if the serviced UE still cannot be reached after one-hop, we allow those involved small cell sites to play as crowdsourcers, and recruit more potential sites into relay transmission, until the transmission is completed. Extensive simulations are conducted to not only demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed transmission paradigm, but also validate the correctness of the proposed incentive mechanisms.","2155-2509","978-1-4673-9622-6","10.1109/COMSNETS.2016.7439964","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7439964","Crowdsourcing;Transmission Paradigm;Heterogeneous Networks (HetNets);Multi-Hop Cellular Network (MCN)","Games;Crowdsourcing;Signal to noise ratio;Computer architecture;Relays;Microprocessors;Computational modeling","","","","15","IEEE","24 Mar 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

While such a system is innovative, and has solidified its prevalence to the public, it is still in its infancy with many improvements yet to come. One of the largest issues present is the imbalance of the Bike Sharing System (BSS), or more broadly ridesharing systems, the unavailability of bikes or empty parking spaces in areas with a high density of users. In this paper, we propose a spatial crowdsourcing approach where users receive monetary incentives to rebalance bikes by returning bikes to stations that need it rather than users' intended locations to improve the system's overall bike utilization. However, how to determine the best incentive mechanism is challenging. We formulate this problem into an optimal matching problem and convert it into a minimum-cost flow problem to find the best way to choose which stations to rebalance and the optimal rebalancing amount. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we validate our approach using D.C. Capital BikeShare data and extensive simulation shows that our approach on average can improve the efficiency and cost of simple greedy algorithms by 32.1%.","","978-1-6654-2621-3","10.1109/ICCSI53130.2021.9736162","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9736162","Ridesharing;crowdsourcing;intelligent transportation systems","Greedy algorithms;Crowdsourcing;Costs;Urban areas;Interference;Bicycles;Data models","","","","15","IEEE","23 Mar 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
