We propose a new concept learning method to solve this problem and also implement it using multiagent technology together with the IBMpsilas UIMA (Unstructured Information Management Architecture) into a semantic search application. In this method an agent in one system can learn a concept which it does not know by getting advices from agents in other systems and integrate the learnt concept into its local ontology.","0840-7789","978-1-4244-1642-4","10.1109/CCECE.2008.4564551","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4564551","supervised learning;ontology;MAS;knowledge repository","Ontologies;Learning systems;Knowledge management;Knowledge engineering;Software systems;Information management;Supervised learning;Collaborative work;Multiagent systems;Autonomous agents","","1","","5","IEEE","15 Jul 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The use of CoPs is one of the practices that agile practitioner literature suggests for knowledge sharing and coordination in large-scale agile software development. Even though CoPs are largely used and studied in other industrial contexts, their usage in industrial large-scale software development has not received much research attention. In this paper we describe our findings from a case study of a large software development organization that successfully used CoPs to support their large-scale agile implementation, as well as their transformation from the waterfall model to Lean and Agile. In this case, the use of CoPs was one of the a key success factors. To advance both research and practice we suggest that future research should pay more attention on CoPs in large-scale agile, e.g. By studying how CoPs should be cultivated in the organization, how they work in practice, what they are used for, as well as the benefits and challenges of cultivating and implementing CoPs.","","978-1-4799-5798-9","10.1109/AGILE.2014.18","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6910401","large-scale agile development;communities of practice;Scrum","Organizations;Communities;Software;Buildings;Context;Software engineering;Agile software development","","1","","11","IEEE","29 Sep 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Such knowledge sharing will bring major advancement on society and the economy. A translation groupware, that allows two or more human translators to edit the output of machine translation at different times and different places, is developed in order to overcome the limitation of human translators and machine translation. However, translation groupware still not widely adopted by current human translators and the effectiveness is not known. An understanding of how multiple translators work and interact within a group is vital to develop a usable groupware. It is hypothesised that collaborative awareness can improve the translation groupware usability. Collaborative awareness components, such as interpersonal space and shared workspace, are identified as important characteristics to enhance the usability of translation groupware.","","978-0-7695-3922-5","10.1109/ICIMT.2009.71","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5381247","Translation Groupware;Collaborative Awareness;Interpersonal Space;Shared Workspace","Collaborative software;Collaborative work;Humans;Dictionaries;Online Communities/Technical Collaboration;Usability;Terminology;Databases;International collaboration;Information technology","","1","","28","IEEE","15 Jan 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

There are two main methodologies in the existing project management (PM): the Last Planner and Scrum, which are rooted in the foundation of the conventional PM doctrine: planning and control. When customers as co-creators are directly engaged in PM processes, the traditional concept of control in PM is unsuitable to a value co-creation project. Therefore, a new managerial methodology is essential for value co-creation activities in new PM. We apply the KIKI model for the new PM based on a service-centered view and a service systems thinking. The model is focused on value co-creation through knowledge creation by such steps as knowledge sharing; identifying needs; knowledge integrating; implementation to meet needs. Those steps are spirally developed such that the knowledge creating process is able to efficiently develop to convert into values.

The paper starts from the emerging concept of learning designs (LDs) that are increasingly used to express teaching/learning scenarios that could be based on any pedagogical model (e.g. problem-based learning, role-playing etc). To address the identified research problem, the paper proposes to extend the existing model of LD lifecycle to capture various knowledge management processes necessary for sharing and reuse of innovative practices. To illustrate the proposed approach, the paper uses an example of problem-based learning.

Smart libraries make use of IoT devices to enhance its processes, with in turn reduce manpower costs. A university campus consists of several smart applications such as smart classrooms, smart parking and smart building among others. To be able to interoperate with these systems and promote decision-making among these smart systems, it is important to represent data of a smart library in formalized ways. Ontologies have played important roles in modelling data of a particular domain, promoting knowledge sharing and reuse as well as enhancing semantic interoperability. After analyzing existing ontologies, it was observed that none fitted a smart library.

Business researchers, such as Hill, Prahalad, Hamel, Miller, Eisenstat and Foote, are recognising the importance of using enterprise architecture methodologies in bringing together people, process and ICT resources and their capabilities to create core competencies for strategic advantage. In light of this recognition, there is value in incorporating EA governance in DBE development. Another value add to DBE development is using emerging ontology methodologies in defining DBE knowledge structures. Ontology is the study and conceptualisation of domain knowledge based on agreements of formal methods and product frameworks. In DBE development, ontology methodologies can be used to foster social and technology semantic knowledge sharing in DBE project management and SDLC workflows, and DBE product designs through using open standards in DBE data modelling. One such ontology methodology that fulfils these two role requirements is the MSPM ontology methodology, a Curtin University research product nearing completion.

Economic complexity reflects the diversity and uniqueness of the products produced in the country. The hypothesis is that economic complexity depends on information policy that promotes knowledge sharing, collective intelligence, research, and decision-making. The ICT-infrastructure provides information policy through formation of the rich information environment. The impact of ICT-infrastructure on economic complexity is assessed using dynamic panel data models based on 44 countries across 14 indicators. Models have shown that economic complexity is influenced by all components of the ICT-infrastructure. Based on this, information policy can be a resource to facilitate diversity and innovation. The main implications for information policy are: (1) creating control networks for accessing information through different technologies, (2) implementing a connectivity-based approach, and (3) prioritizing the open environment for collective creativity rather than spreading a particular point of view. Thus, economic complexity can develop due to the heterogeneity of the information environment, which corresponds to the law of requisite variety.","2832-0514","978-1-6654-7064-3","10.1109/SYNCHROINFO55067.2022.9840976","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9840976","information policy;ICT-infrastructure;economic complexity;innovation economy;information society","Economics;Technological innovation;Organizations;Production;Telephone sets;Data models;Complexity theory","","1","","12","IEEE","4 Aug 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper develops a preliminary Chinese ontology automatic modeling tool (COAMT) to support the automatic acquisition of SRSC. First, SRSC is divided into 4 unified classes, namely, human behavior risks, equipment risks, environment risks, and organizational management risks, and the text information is used to collect knowledge. Then the information is preprocessed by natural language processing technology to obtain the asserted text information. Finally, the obtained assertions are added to the ontology with the support of cognitive operations, and the ontology is continuously expanded or modified to update the ontology knowledge base. In this paper, the COAMT can promote knowledge sharing and reuse between engineers and computer applications, and solve the problems of low efficiency and error-prone by manual modeling.","","978-1-7281-8832-4","10.1109/ICUEMS50872.2020.00025","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9151793","component;safety risk knowledge;subway construction;ontology;automatic modeling","Ontologies;Safety;Public transportation;Tools;Risk management;Natural language processing","","1","","15","IEEE","29 Jul 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Before use at the O-level, the lETM's are validated. However, practical situations arise which are not covered in sufficient detail by an IETM. In these situations, maintainers must rely on their own knowledge and experience to facilitate a successful repair. The larger body of navy maintainers cannot easily benefit from a single maintainer's practical lessons learned. No medium currently exists to facilitate timely knowledge-sharing. The naval air systems command (NAVAIR) utilizes the Technical Publications Deficiency Reporting (TPDR) program for reporting deficiencies in technical manuals and taking corrective action. However, in the case of non-safety-related deficiencies, this program takes too much time to be of immediate use to a maintainer. A ""wiki"" is a type of Web-based document that allows participants to easily add and edit content. It is especially suited for collaborative writing. This paper describes one mechanism for leveraging the wiki concept to allow maintainers to communicate with each other regarding non-safety-related maintenance issues via editable web pages outside of and in addition to current validated technical manuals. A wiki IETM has been created by the integrated diagnostics and automated test systems (IDATS) team at NAVAIR Lakehurst to demonstrate this concept. Experiments were carried out in which participants were asked to complete a laboratory task following a procedure created by the authors. A control group was asked to follow the procedure as it was written. Another group was given the benefit of using the wiki comments in addition to the procedure. The experiences of both groups were then compared. This effort has shown that it is useful to establish a Navy-wide forum through which maintainers can quickly communicate lessons learned using the wiki philosophy.","1558-4550","1-4244-0051-1","10.1109/AUTEST.2006.283694","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4062407","","Manuals;Lakes;Road transportation;Writing;Collaboration;Web pages;Automatic testing;System testing;Automatic control;Standardization","","1","","6","IEEE","15 Jan 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, m-learning platforms that are currently in place are not viable solution in all contexts and not necessarily the best solution. Therefore, the design of m-learning content should focus on learning profile and personal needs such as location and affordability.

In such systems, safety assurance cases (SACs) are an emerging approach that adopts a proactive strategy to produce structuralized safety justifications and arguments. While SACs are recommended in many software-intensive safety-critical domains, the lack of knowledge regarding the practitioners' perspectives on using SACs hinders effective adoption of this approach. To gain such knowledge, we interviewed nine practitioners and safety experts who focused on safety-critical software systems. In general, our participants found the SAC approach beneficial for communication of safety arguments and management of safety issues in a multidisciplinary setting. The challenges they faced when using SACs were primarily associated with (1) a lack of tool support, (2) insufficient process integration, and (3) scarcity of experienced personnel. To overcome those challenges, our participants suggested tactics that focused on creating direct safety arguments. Process and organizational adjustments are also needed to streamline SAC analysis and creation. Finally, our participants emphasized the importance of knowledge sharing about SACs across software-intensive safety-critical domains.","2574-1837","978-1-4503-5725-8","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8445537","safety-assurance case;practitioner perspectives;empirical study;safety critical systems","Safety;Interviews;Software systems;Tools;Best practices;Uncertainty","","1","","16","","26 Aug 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The National University Commissions (NUC) - the regulatory body for university education in Nigeria is proposing such. Nevertheless, in its drive to attain world-class status, Covenant University (CU) has developed and adopted an Open Access Policy (OAP) on the use and sharing of research findings, as well as dissemination of technical and pedagogical information. At CU efforts are geared towards the entrenchment of an OA culture in the management of interactions on knowledge sharing and use. Since its introduction in November 2011, OA has been on a steady rise in awareness and application in various strata of the university's interactions both internally and in relation to the external context. CU through its OA office (OACU) engaged in awareness exercises to sensitize its researchers, faculty and other workers alike on OA issues as well as develop and adopt an OAP. At present, the university has a functional repository system (http://eprints.covenantuniversity.edu.ng/) to which it requires faculty and staff to self-archive scholarly publications. The University runs a Green Open Access Journal (OAJ) platform comprising of seven journals (http://journals.covenantuniversity.edu.ng) covering the sciences to human development. Similarly, CU has adopted a publication and incentive system for its researchers and faculty that drives the publication of research works from the university in OA journals and conferences. The University only recently launched a lifelong teaching program and is about concluding the development of an Open and Distance Learning (ODL) policy to drive distance learning.","","978-1-4799-5739-2","10.1109/ICWOAL.2014.7009197","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7009197","Covenant University;Open Access;Repository;Open Access Journal;Lifelong Learning;ODL","Educational institutions;Open Access;Computer aided instruction;Communities;Africa","","1","","13","IEEE","15 Jan 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The purpose of ontology matching is to reuse the ontologies and integrate them in different fields. It is the basement of the other semantic Web application, such as, semantic Web-based service, ontology alignment. Nowadays most ontology mapping approaches integrate multiple individual matchers to explore both linguistic and structure similarity of different ontologies. Thus how to effectively aggregating different similarities is pervasive in ontology mapping. However, the achievements of similarities aggregation are very limited. Addressing this issue, the work presented in this paper puts forward an ontology matching approach, which uses as a backbone a multi-similarity matching technique and explores both linguistic and structure similarity. In the process of similarities aggregation, the method based on statistical learning is used. Our approach takes the different similarities into one whole, as a similarity vector. All of them form the similarity space, by this way, matching discovery can be converted into binary classification. SVM (support vector machine) is used to carry on this task. For making full use of the message of ontology, our implementation and experimental results are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the matching approach.","2156-7387","978-1-4244-4994-1","10.1109/ICIECS.2009.5363494","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5363494","","Ontologies;Support vector machines;Support vector machine classification;Semantic Web;Databases;Data analysis;Artificial intelligence;Computer science;Knowledge engineering;Spine","","1","","14","IEEE","28 Dec 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Employees' knowledge as an important domain of the organization is an essential asset to build an organizational competitive advantage, increase innovation, and provide a valuable contribution to a company. The role of knowledge management is needed in an effort to achieve those goals. Many companies do not yet realize the importance of knowledge management. Even though there have been efforts to implement knowledge management, it is still limited. One example is the company that is our case study which does a knowledge management process traditionally, relying on face-to-face meetings and communication, face-to-face knowledge sharing, and storing a documentation file only in Google Drive. Employee knowledge is not managed properly by the company, resulting in less-than-optimal utilization of employee knowledge. Therefore, the company needs an information system as a platform for managing employee knowledge. Knowledge Management Systems (KMS) can be developed to support the optimization of the knowledge management process. This study aims to build a web based KMS for the company. As a result, the KMS was developed and deployed successfully. Three main activities were successfully carried out by utilizing the KMS, that are preserving, sharing, and enhancing the knowledge of employees. The system has also been tested and successfully passed all test scenarios. The results of this study can be taken into consideration by other researchers or practitioners who will develop KMS in the future.","","979-8-3503-9455-9","10.1109/ICICyTA60173.2023.10429005","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10429005","Knowledge management system;preserving the knowledge;sharing the knowledge;enhancing the knowledge","Technological innovation;Key performance indicator;Companies;Knowledge management;Real-time systems;Usability;Testing","","1","","19","IEEE","13 Feb 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The extraction of human centered descriptions, matching end users cognition, and specifically the detection and identification of events in videos is a particularly challenging problem, due to the volume and diversity of both the low-level features that can be extracted from multimedia data, and also of the corresponding high-level information conveyed. Numerous efforts have begun, attempting to bridge the semantic gap between low-level data and higher level descriptions, often resorting to domain-specific learning-based approaches. The advent, however of the Semantic Web paved a new direction in knowledge management and utilization, advancing aspects such as knowledge sharing and reuse. In this paper we present a novel, generally applicable approach, for hierarchical semantic analysis of spatiotemporal video features (trajectories) in order to localize and detect events of interest. Dynamically changing trajectories are extracted by processing the optical flow, based on its statistics. The temporal evolution of the trajectories' geometrical and spatiotemporal characteristics forms the basis on which event detection is performed. This is based on the exploitation of prior knowledge, which provides the formal conceptualization needed to enable the automatic inference of high level event descriptions. To enhance extensibility, a modular approach has been followed, employing different ontologies for the individual types of knowledge required, namely geometrical, spatiotemporal and domain related. Thus, knowledge and consequently derived descriptions, propagate along successively higher abstraction levels. Experimental results with a variety of surveillance videos are presented to exemplify the usability and effectiveness of the proposed system.","","978-0-7695-2997-4","10.1109/ICSC.2007.33","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4338417","","Ontologies;Event detection;Videos;Spatiotemporal phenomena;Data mining;Data analysis;Image analysis;Multimedia databases;Image databases;Humans","","1","","11","IEEE","8 Oct 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Precision machining includes complex professional technical knowledge. Technician uses a self-understanding way to label the machining setting. This setting implies important technical knowledge, but is difficult to teach others. Furthermore, when changes machining parts, technician needs to review and modify machining parameter and program due to the limit of human memory, Manufacturing process may be delayed when machining adjusting can not achieve program optimization. It is common problem face small and medium enterprises. The topic of knowledge management has wide application in knowledge-intensive industry, but less attention in technical field. Technical knowledge tends to be tacit. Personal tacit knowledge must convert to explicit knowledge, and then personal knowledge is possible to preserve and spread to organization. In this research, we select a typical CNC milling parts in precision machining, systematic analyze machining procedure, and utilize documentation strategy to construct machining knowledge management system. The outcome of this knowledge sharing platform can be a template for other precision machining.","","978-1-4673-0024-7","10.1109/FSKD.2012.6234164","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6234164","technology-intensive industry; precision machining;tacit knowledge;explicit knowledge;documentation strategy;knowledge management system","Knowledge management;Milling;Computer numerical control;Industries;Organizations;Knowledge engineering","","1","","17","IEEE","9 Jul 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In knowledge management, experiences are an example of tacit knowledge. Tacit knowledge is regarded as one of the main challenges in knowledge management. One of the best ways in sharing tacit knowledge is using storytelling. As part of knowledge management, storytelling offers sharing of a more structured and absorbable form of tacit knowledge.

In the ontology hierarchy, vertical information is the main factor used in many mapping methods, while the horizontal relation is not employed fully yet. In this paper, from the aspect of the dimensions of the concept in ontologies, which describes the horizontal relation of ontology concepts, an ontology mapping approach is proposed. The values on concept dimensions could be named concepts, intersections, unions, complements or restrictions. They are compared with ontology concepts to help ontology mapping.

This approach takes lots of effort in searching, retrieving and integrating knowledge. To overcome this issue, we propose an approach to do this task. We first represent knowledge by some ontologies in internet and each of them represents a subdomain knowledge respectively, and then we integrate it through a web service platform. Sharing ontology in internet based on web service provides a simple and flexible manner for knowledge sharing, retrieval and integration. To demonstrate the feasibility of our approach, we use diabetes care as an example to use this system because it needs different professionals to make up a care plan.

The general exam system is based on three layers: the user layer, the application logic layer and the data services layer with ontology base, user feature base, method base and knowledge base. In the system, ontology is used to describe the knowledge, realize knowledge sharing and exchange, and the multi-agents, agents' coordination and collaboration are used respectively to realize various functions and application of the system. This model is successfully applied to computer basic course examinations.","","978-1-4244-4076-4","10.1109/MAPE.2009.5355790","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5355790","Ontology;multi-agent;three-tier structure;Examination System","Ontologies;Collaboration;Paper technology;Computer networks;Network servers;Multiagent systems;Knowledge management;Logic;Application software;Educational technology","","1","","9","IEEE","18 Dec 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"How can knowledge management improve the Tendering process in railway transport","D. Penciuc; D. V. D. Abeele; M. -H.

Therefore, a process of further adapting the reference solution is necessary and this adaptation starts with the Tendering phase which thus becomes one of the most critical of a product life-cycle. A study carried out in the company A revealed that knowledge management could bring further improvements to the Tendering, in particular as regard to knowledge primordial for this process, which we generically call “intangibles” and to knowledge sharing. In this context, we think that knowledge management should be joined to organizational learning to support the Tendering process. Furthermore, we want to build a dedicated workspace to respond to these needs. In this paper we explain how knowledge management can contribute to the enhancement of the Tendering process in the company A and we propose an approach to support knowledge management and organizational learning through a dedicated workspace.","","978-1-4577-0387-4","10.1109/CSCWD.2011.5960212","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5960212","Knowledge management;tacit knowledge;organisational learning;intangibles;organisational memory;product-line development","Knowledge management;Ontologies;Companies;Collaboration;Rail transportation;Communities","","1","","15","IEEE","21 Jul 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
