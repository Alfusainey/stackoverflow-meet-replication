General SA tools are trained based on movie or product review data. Research has shown that these SA tools can produce negative results when applied to the field of SE. In order to overcome the above limitations, developers need to customize tools (e.g., SentiStrength-SE, SentiCR, Senti4SD). In recent years, the pre-trained transformer-based models have brought great breakthroughs in the field of natural language processing. Therefore, we intend to fine-tune the pre-trained model BERT for downstream text classification tasks. We compare the performance of SE-specific tools. Meanwhile, we also studied the performance of SE-specific tools in a cross-platform setting. Experimental results show that our approach (BERT-FT) outperforms the existing state-of-the-art models in terms of F1-scores.","","978-1-6654-4045-5","10.1109/ICSS53362.2021.00026","Research and Development; Natural Science Foundation of Hainan Province; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9492202","sentiment analysis;software engineering;Natural Language processing","Sentiment analysis;Bit error rate;Text categorization;Tools;Motion pictures;Task analysis;Software engineering","","6","","33","IEEE","26 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Empirical evidence suggests that studying the human factor in software-related issues is multifaceted. Although analyses on different levels of developer networks have been performed, there is no existing work that moves beyond developer technical skills to take into account other important factors that might affect development work, such as personality and non-technical skills. For this reason, in this work we propose an approach that aims at finding links between badges – a sort of gamification awarded for developer's participation – personality traits, and interpersonal skills from Stack Overflow developers' community. The Generalized Linear Models (GLM) approach is adopted in order to examine the effects of personality traits and interpersonal skills on the non-technical awarded badges. Experimental results from the application of the proposed framework revealed statistically significant effects of both personality traits and interpersonal skills on the award gamification process.","","978-1-5386-7383-6","10.1109/SEAA.2018.00042","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8498209","people analytics;software repositories;personality traits;competence mining","Feature extraction;Software;Data mining;Human factors;Software engineering;Encoding;Linguistics","","5","","28","IEEE","21 Oct 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Under the hood, Expositor efficiently implements traces as lazy, sparse interval trees whose contents are materialized on demand. Expositor also provides a novel data structure, the edit hash array mapped trie, which is a lazy implementation of sets, maps, multisets, and multimaps that enables programmers to maximize the efficiency of their debugging scripts.

In addition, texts produced by Portuguese-speaking developers mix languages since many keywords and programming concepts are referred to by their English name. In this paper, we provide empirical insights into the challenges of analyzing software artifacts written in Portuguese. We analyzed 100 question titles from the Portuguese version of Stack Overflow with two Portuguese language tools and identified multiple problems which resulted in very few sentences being tagged completely correctly.

Thus, they post related questions on external online sources to seek better commenting practices. In this paper, we analyze code comment discussions on online sources such as Stack Overflow (SO) and Quora to shed some light on the questions developers ask about commenting practices. We apply Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to identify emerging topics concerning code comments. Then we manually analyze a statistically significant sample set of posts to derive a taxonomy that provides an overview of the developer questions about commenting practices.Our results highlight that on SO nearly 40% of the questions mention how to write or process comments in documentation tools and environments, and nearly 20% of the questions are about potential limitations and possibilities of documentation tools to add automatically and consistently more information in comments. On the other hand, on Quora, developer questions focus more on background information (35% of the questions) or asking opinions (16% of the questions) about code comments. We found that (i) not all aspects of comments are covered in coding style guidelines, e.g., how to add a specific type of information, (ii) developers need support in learning the syntax and format conventions to add various types of information in comments, and (iii) developers are interested in various automated strategies for comments such as detection of bad comments, or verify comment style automatically, but lack tool support to do that.","2470-6892","978-1-6654-4897-0","10.1109/SCAM52516.2021.00027","National Science Foundation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9610635","Mining online sources;Stack Overflow;Quora;Code Comment analysis;Software documentation","Codes;Taxonomy;Documentation;Manuals;Tools;Syntactics;Maintenance engineering","","5","","51","IEEE","24 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To bridge this gap and accelerate such an understanding, we extracted posts from Stack Overflow to identify the most commonly discussed issues in microservice development and testing and we categorised the concerns. Our results indicate that (i) missing parameters and operations are the most common concerns in service routing; (ii) wrong versions of libraries, annotations, protocols, and clusters appear as the main concerns on service discovery; (iii) the absence of authorisation operation and web tokens exposed for a long time are the main concerns related to service authentication and authorisation; and (iv) the absence of configuration parameters for cache and inadequate patterns for long-running transactions emerge as trending concerns in service invocation.

We find that this issue does not affect the quality of random numbers that are generated by the PRNG and used in Android applications because recent Android devices do not lack entropy sources. However, we identify a vulnerability in which the stack canary for all future Android applications is generated earlier than the PRNG is properly setup. This vulnerability makes stack overflow simpler and threats Android applications linked with native code (through NDK) as well as Dalvik VM instances. An attacker could nullify the stack protecting mechanism, given the knowledge of the time of boot or a malicious app running on the victim device. This vulnerability also affects the address space layout randomization (ASLR) mechanism on Android, and can turn it from a weak protection to void.

Empirical software engineering researchers can mine the artifacts from these tools to better understand how FLOSS is made. As the landscape of distributed software development has grown and changed, the tools needed to make FLOSS have changed as well. There are three newer tools at the center of FLOSS development today: distributed version control based forges (like Github), programmer question-and-answer communities (like Stack Overflow), and paste bin tools (like Gist or Pastebin.com). These tools are extending and changing the toolset used for FLOSS development, and redefining what a software forge looks like.

Knowledge units often contain semantically relevant knowledge, and thus linkable for different purposes, such as duplicate questions, directly linkable for problem solving, indirectly linkable for related information. Recognising different classes of linkable knowledge would support more targeted information needs when users search or explore the knowledge base. Existing methods focus on binary relatedness (i.e., related or not), and are not robust to recognize different classes of semantic relatedness when linkable knowledge units share few words in common (i.e., have lexical gap). In this paper, we formulate the problem of predicting semantically linkable knowledge units as a multiclass classification problem, and solve the problem using deep learning techniques. To overcome the lexical gap issue, we adopt neural language model (word embeddings) and convolutional neural network (CNN) to capture word- and document-level semantics of knowledge units. Instead of using human-engineered classifier features which are hard to design for informal user-generated content, we exploit large amounts of different types of user-created knowledge-unit links to train the CNN to learn the most informative wordlevel and document-level features for the multiclass classification task. Our evaluation shows that our deep-learning based approach significantly and consistently outperforms traditional methods using traditional word representations and human-engineered classifier features.","","978-1-4503-3845-5","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7582745","Link prediction;Semantic relatedness;Multiclass classification;Deep learning;Mining software repositories","Semantics;Knowledge engineering;Software;Uniform resource locators;Complex networks;Machine learning;Social network services","","4","","51","","6 Oct 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Therefore, these annotations are important for the correct execution of programs. In practice, however, developers often find it hard to correctly use annotations and the misuse of annotations has led to real bugs in Java programs. In this paper, we conduct an empirical study on Stack Overflow questions to investigate the major development frameworks that are involved in questions about Java annotations and the main problems encountered by developers in the use of Java annotations. Based on the findings of the study, we propose DeepAnna, a deep learning based Java annotation recommendation and misuse detection approach.

DeepAnna can recommend annotations at both class level and method level. Our evaluation with a large corpus of open-source Java projects shows that DeepAnna outperforms state-of-the-art text multi-label classification approaches in annotation recommendation and can effectively detect annotation misuses.

To solve this problem, high-quality answer prediction or best answer prediction has been one of important topics in social media. These user-generated answers often consist of multiple “views”, each capturing different (albeit related) information (e.g., expertise of the asker, length of the answer, etc.). Such views interact with each other in complex manners that should carry a lot of information for distinguishing a potential best answer from others.

Based on these findings, we propose a knowledge graph based approach APIComp that automatically extracts API knowledge from API reference documentation to support the comparison of a pair of API classes or methods from different aspects.

The goal of this paper is to help current and potential configuration as code (CaC) adoptees in identifying the challenges related to CaC through an analysis of questions asked by programmers on a major question and answer website. We extract 2,758 Puppet-related questions asked by programmers from January 2010 to December 2016, posted on Stack Overflow. We apply qualitative analysis to identify the questions programmers ask about Puppet. We also investigate the trends in questions with unsatisfactory answers, and changes in question categories over time. From our empirical study, we synthesize 16 major categories of questions. The three most common question categories are: (i) syntax errors, (ii) provisioning instances; and (iii) assessing Puppet's feasibility to accomplish certain tasks.

Especially, for business organizations such as technology companies, the human resource is the driving factor of the company's growth which depends on employees' motivation, skills and quality of work. Employees often change their jobs when they are not satisfied with it. Different factors may cause a change in the level of job satisfaction of an employee. For example, the dynamic nature of the Information Technology (IT) industry is an impactful factor that determines the job satisfaction of IT professionals. Foreseeing the employees' job satisfaction makes it easy for a company to take swift actions to improve the job satisfaction of its employees. In this research, we analyzed the effectiveness of machine learning (ML) methods for predicting job satisfaction using employee job profiles. There are job-specific factors in each job domain, and those factors may influence job satisfaction levels. Therefore, this research focused on the following fundamental questions: 1) How do existing ML models perform when predicting job satisfaction of software developers? 2) Can the job satisfaction prediction models be generalized to the other job roles in the IT industry? This study compared the performance of classification models: Random Forest (RF), Logistic Regression (LR), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Neural Network (NN) in predicting the level of job satisfaction. Our experiments used two benchmark datasets: Stack Overflow developer survey and IBM HR analytics dataset. The experimental analysis shows that both employee-related factors and company-related factors contribute similarly to predicting job satisfaction. On average, the above ML models predict the job satisfaction of software developers with an accuracy of around 79%.","2613-8662","978-1-6654-0965-0","10.1109/SCSE53661.2021.9568331","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9568331","classification models;data mining;job satisfaction;machine learning","Industries;Support vector machines;Radio frequency;Companies;Artificial neural networks;Predictive models;Benchmark testing","","2","","28","IEEE","25 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This potential justifies the enthusiasm and growing interest in DRL in both academia and industry. However, the community currently focuses mostly on the development phase of DRL systems, with little attention devoted to DRL deployment. In this paper, we propose an empirical study on Stack Overflow (SO), the most popular Q&A forum for developers, to uncover and understand the challenges practitioners faced when deploying DRL systems. Specifically, we categorized relevant SO posts by deployment platforms: server/cloud, mobile/embedded system, browser, and game engine. After filtering and manual analysis, we examined 357 SO posts about DRL deployment, investigated the current state, and identified the challenges related to deploying DRL systems. Then, we investigate the prevalence and difficulty of these challenges. Results show that the general interest in DRL deployment is growing, confirming the study’s relevance and importance. Results also show that DRL deployment is more difficult than other DRL issues. Additionally, we built a taxonomy of 31 unique challenges in deploying DRL to different platforms. On all platforms, RL environment-related challenges are the most popular, and communication-related challenges are the most difficult among practitioners. We hope our study inspires future research and helps the community overcome the most common and difficult challenges practitioners face when deploying DRL systems.","2576-3148","979-8-3503-2783-0","10.1109/ICSME58846.2023.00015","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10336261","Empirical;Deep Reinforcement Learning;Software Deployment;Taxonomy of Challenges;Stack Overflow","Deep learning;Video games;Software maintenance;Service robots;Soft sensors;Taxonomy;Reinforcement learning","","2","","82","IEEE","11 Dec 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Our technique, POSIT, simultaneously provides abstract syntax tree tags for source code tokens, part-of-speech tags for natural language words, and predicts the source language of a token in mixed text. To realize POSIT, we trained a biLSTM network with a Conditional Random Field output layer using abstract syntax tree tags from the CLANG compiler and part-of-speech tags from the Standard Stanford part-of-speech tagger.

SO allows its users to suggest edits to improve the quality of the posts (i.e., questions and answers). Such posts can be rolled back to an earlier version when the current version of the post with the suggested edit does not satisfy the user. However, subjectivity bias in deciding either an edit is satisfactory or not could introduce inconsistencies in the rollback edits. For example, while a user may accept the formatting of a method name (e.g., getActivity()) as a code term, another user may reject it. Such bias in rollback edits could be detrimental and demotivating to the users whose suggested edits were rolled back. This problem is compounded due to the absence of specific guidelines and tools to support consistency across users on their rollback actions. To mitigate this problem, we investigate the inconsistencies in the rollback editing process of SO and make three contributions. First, we identify eight inconsistency types in rollback edits through a qualitative analysis of 777 rollback edits in 382 questions and 395 answers. Second, we determine the impact of the eight rollback inconsistencies by surveying 44 software developers. More than 80% of the study participants find our produced catalogue of rollback inconsistencies to be detrimental to the post quality. Third, we develop a suite of algorithms to detect the eight rollback inconsistencies. The algorithms offer more than 95% accuracy and thus can be used to automatically but reliably inform users in SO of the prevalence of inconsistencies in their suggested edits and rollback actions.","2574-3864","978-1-7281-8710-5","10.1109/MSR52588.2021.00050","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; Canada First Research Excellence Fund; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9463153","Stack Overflow;rollback edits;inconsistency","Software algorithms;Tools;Software;Encoding;Reliability;Data mining;Standards","","2","","52","IEEE","28 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this work, we investigate the usefulness of stop word removal in a software engineering context. To do this, we replicate and experiment with three software engineering research tools from related work. Additionally, we construct a corpus of software engineering domain-related text from 10,000 Stack Overflow questions and identify 200 domain-specific stop words using traditional information-theoretic methods.

Plot2API is a very challenging task, since each plot is often associated with multiple APIs and the appearances of the graphics drawn by the same API can be extremely varied due to the different settings of the parameters. Additionally, the samples of different APIs also suffer from extremely imbalanced.Considering the lack of technologies in Plot2API, we present a novel deep multi-task learning approach named Semantic Parsing Guided Neural Network (SPGNN) which translates the Plot2API issue as a multi-label image classification and an image semantic parsing tasks for the solution. In SPGNN, the recently advanced Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) named EfficientNet is employed as the backbone network for API recommendation. Meanwhile, a semantic parsing module is complemented to exploit the semantic relevant visual information in feature learning and eliminate the appearance-relevant visual information which may confuse the visual-information-based API recommendation. Moreover, the recent data augmentation technique named random erasing is also applied for alleviating the imbalance of API categories.We collect plots with the graphic APIs used to drawn them from Stack Overflow, and release three new Plot2API datasets corresponding to the graphic APIs of R and Python programming languages for evaluating the effectiveness of Plot2API techniques. Extensive experimental results not only demonstrate the superiority of our method over the recent deep learning baselines but also show the practicability of our method in the recommendation of graphic APIs.","1534-5351","978-1-7281-9630-5","10.1109/SANER50967.2021.00049","Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9425892","API Recommendation;Data Visualization;Image Recognition","Deep learning;Visualization;Semantics;Neural networks;Data visualization;Software;Task analysis","","2","","48","IEEE","11 May 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Several frameworks have been proposed to simplify the development of cross-platform mobile applications and, therefore, to reduce development and maintenance costs. Between them, cross-compiler mobile development frameworks, such as Xamarin from Microsoft, transform the application's code written in intermediate (aka non-native) language to native code for each target platform (Android, iOS). However, to our best knowledge, there is not much research about the advantages and disadvantages of the use of those frameworks during the development and maintenance phases of mobile applications. The objective of this paper is to present two datasets of questions and answers (Q&A) related to the development of mobile applications using Xamarin. Our datasets have 85,908 questions mined from the Xamarin Forum and 44,434 from Stack Overflow. To show their usefulness, we present two experiments. First, we replicate a study for discovering the main discussion topics of Xamarin development present in the two datasets using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), and we compare them with topics previously reported about mobile development. Between the main topics discovered from those questions, we found that some of them are exclusively related to Xamarin and Microsoft technologies such as the design pattern 'MVVM'. Secondly, we aim at improving the official Xamarin documentation, which does not provide a complete description of the error codes that the Xamarin platform throws during development. We use our datasets of Q&A for complementing the error codes with information mined from accepted answers. We could complement the documentation of 23,9% of the error codes.","","978-1-7281-3395-9","10.1109/MOBILESoft.2019.00032","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8816909","mobile;xamarin;cross platform mobile applications;mobile development;LDA;Latent Dirichlet Allocation;Stack Overflow;Mining Software Repositories;Questions and Answers;Android;Documentation;topic modeling","Mobile applications;Documentation;Maintenance engineering;Libraries;Facebook;Resource management;Data mining","","2","","55","IEEE","29 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To address this, we propose point process and neural network-based algorithms for three prediction tasks regarding a user's response to a question: whether the user will answer, the net votes that will be received on the answer, and the time that will elapse before the answer. These algorithms learn over a set of 20 features we define for each pair of user and question that quantify both topical and structural aspects of the forums, including discussion post similarities and social centrality measures. Through evaluation on a Stack Overflow dataset consisting of 20,000 question threads, we find that our method outperforms baselines on each prediction task by more than 20%. We also find that the importance of the features varies depending on the task and the amount of historical data available for inference.

If applied to any religious text, it can help to relate how similar pieces of knowledge are described in different places. This paper uses Word2Vec and Sent2Vec models to facilitate the process of knowledge extraction from a given corpus. The paper makes use of several English translations of the Holy Quran which is the most sacred book for Muslims. Sent2vec models have been trained from several translations of the book and the trained models are then subsequently utilized to study the semantic relationship between different words and sentences. The performance of the custom-built word embeddings is compared against the pre-trained embeddings provided by the Spacy library.","","978-1-7281-7113-5","10.1109/ICETST49965.2020.9080691","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9080691","Word Embedding;Word2vec;Holy Quran;Semantic Text Similarity(STS);Quranic Verses Similarity","","","1","","14","IEEE","30 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Interestingly, there were only two questions related to attacks against cryptography. There were 63 discussions in which developers had interoperability issues when working with more than a crypto library. The majority of posts (112) were about encryption/decryption problems and 111 were about installation/compilation issues of crypto libraries. Overall, we realize that the crypto libraries are frequently involved in more than five themes of discussions. We believe the current initial findings can help team leaders and experienced developers to correctly guide the team members in the domain of cryptography.

This makes it challenging for predictive models to understand the social connections between forum users. In this paper, we propose a novel framework to solve the comment prediction problem in online forums. Specifically, the framework incorporates attention mechanisms to capture users’ interests in the post contents and a stacked graph convolutional network to perceive users’ implicit social relationships from their past temporal interactions. The multi-modal features learned by the framework would be combined together through a fusion layer and used for the final prediction.

In contrast to technical knowledge, strategic knowledge provides insight into how to approach problem-solving. Prior work has demonstrated that developers can make use of written strategies to improve their problem-solving. However, there is currently no way for developers to share, curate, and search for this knowledge at scale. To address this gap, we contribute HowToo, a platform for sharing, finding, and using programming strategies. Its key insight is that there are many different approaches to the same problem, and developers may need different strategies depending on their situation. In a longitudinal evaluation with more than 30 students in a project-based software engineering course, we found that: 1) students viewed HowToo as complementary to technical resources; 2) students viewed strategies as helping them be more systematic and complete in their work; 3) HowToo helped students be more confident in their problem solving; 4) when students were under time pressure, they were less inclined to use HowToo to structure their work, as being mindful required them to slow down.","1943-6106","978-1-6654-4592-4","10.1109/VL/HCC51201.2021.9576337","National Science Foundation(grant numbers:CCF-1703734,CCF-1703304); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9576337","Q&A;knowledge sharing;programming strategies","Visualization;Systematics;Blogs;Documentation;Programming;Problem-solving;Software engineering","","1","","43","IEEE","29 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper introduces an approach, called Scout, that automatically analyzes search results to extract API signature information. These signatures are used to group and rank examples and allow for a unique API-based presentation that reduces the amount of information the developer needs to consider when looking for API information on the web. This succinct representation enables Scout to be integrated fully within an IDE panel so that developers can search and view API examples without losing context on their development task. Scout also uses this integration to automatically augment queries with contextual information that tailors the developer's queries, and ranks the results according to the developer's needs. In an experiment with 40 developers, we found that Scout reduces the number of queries developers need to perform by 19% and allows them to solve almost half their tasks directly from the API-based representation, reducing the number of complete SO posts viewed by approximately 64%.","1558-1225","979-8-4007-0217-4","10.1145/3597503.3639089","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10549139","API signatures;code search;controlled experiment","Information resources;Codes;Source coding;Search engines;Programming;Data mining;Task analysis","","","","50","","14 Jun 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For example, for a task that requires upgrading to a new version of an API component, a developer may seek information in the API's official documentation, check community discussions about the newer version, and so on. To aid developers in locating the portion of the text that might be useful in these artifacts, prior work has used syntactic properties of the text, and an artifact's meta-data, to automatically identify relevant text for particular kinds of artifacts. Although effective, these techniques rely on assumptions about an artifact's structure or content that prevent applying them across the different types of artifacts that a developer may come across in their daily work. In this paper, we investigate whether techniques building on approaches to interpret the meaning, or semantics, of the text help to overcome these limitations. Particularly, we introduce six semantic-based techniques and evaluate that they can identify up to 58% of the text that developers deem relevant to Android development tasks. When compared to a state-of-the-art approach, we find that our techniques achieve comparable recall values, identifying 63% of the small fraction of the task-relevant text of Stack Overflow artifacts, but without the need for artifact-specific information.","1534-5351","978-1-6654-3786-8","10.1109/SANER53432.2022.00039","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) Discovery; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9825905","Empirical Software Engineering;Software Tasks;Natural Language Artifacts","Conferences;Semantics;Natural languages;Buildings;Documentation;Syntactics;Software","","","","71","IEEE","21 Jul 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Currently, the rules that are more effective are the ones that are defined manually, but the creation of such rules is resource-consuming as it requires experts to define them. In this paper, we develop a method of automatic rule definition for pattern-based text mining. Our method is investigated in terms of aspect classification and sentiment analysis. We also examine combining pattern-based text mining with machine learning techniques. The evaluations were performed using two text data, namely, those mentioning API from Stack Overflow and those of Amazon review on PC peripherals.

It is the successor of the Android Support library since Android 9.0. Since then, many apps that originally relied on Android Support needed to be adapted to use AndroidX. However, for app developers, such a migration task can be challenging and error-prone. Yet, there is no systematic study on the migration status of real-world Android apps or the issues that may arise during the migration to AndroidX. To fill this knowledge gap, we conducted the first comprehensive study concerning the adoption and adaptation of the AndroidX library. In this study, we inspected 171 Stack Overflow posts about AndroidX and identified common categories of issues that can occur when adapting apps to use AndroidX, as well as the causes. We also examined the trend of these issues in recent five years to assess their impact over time. Then, we investigated the utilization status of both Android Support and AndroidX libraries in 15,334 top commercial apps and 2,470 open-source apps. Finally, we developed an algorithm that utilizes cosine similarity to identify Java class mappings between Android Support and AndroidX. The algorithm allows us to recover an additional mapping of 579 Java class pairs, which can supplement the official class mapping. Our study reveals the following key findings: (1) Improper API usage, misuse of dependencies, and incorrect build configurations are common challenges faced by developers during the adoption of AndroidX; (2) Around 13.3% commercial apps and 17% open-source apps still rely on the Android Support library; (3) Inconsistencies are observed between the API migration table in Android Studio and the API mapping table provided in AndroidX documentation. (4) On average, the migrated AndroidX classes achieve a 0.978 code similarity score with the original Android Support classes.","2693-9177","979-8-3503-1958-3","10.1109/QRS60937.2023.00048","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10366772","Android;AndroidX;Android Support Library;API Migration","Java;Systematics;Taxonomy;Software quality;Market research;Libraries;Software reliability","","","","36","IEEE","25 Dec 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Numerous AIGC detectors have been developed and evaluated on natural language data. However, their performance on code-related content generated by LLMs remains unexplored.To fill this gap, in this paper, we present an empirical study evaluating existing AIGC detectors in the software domain. We select three state-of-the-art LLMs, i.e., GPT-3.5, WizardCoder and CodeLlama, for machine-content generation. We further created a comprehensive dataset including 2.23M samples comprising code-related content for each model, encompassing popular software activities like Q&A (150K), code summarization (1M), and code generation (1.1M). We evaluated thirteen AIGC detectors, comprising six commercial and seven open-source solutions, assessing their performance on this dataset. Our results indicate that AIGC detectors perform less on code-related data than natural language data.

According to our analysis of 154 questions about challenges of understanding pythonic idioms on Stack Overflow, we find that Python users face various challenges in comprehending pythonic idioms. And the usage of pythonic idioms in 7,577 GitHub projects reveals the prevalence of pythonic idioms. By using a statistical sampling method, we find pythonic idioms result in not only lexical conciseness but also the creation of variables and functions, which indicates it is not straightforward to map back to non-idiomatic code. And usage of pythonic idioms may even cause potential negative effects such as code redundancy, bugs and performance degradation. To alleviate such readability issues and negative effects, we develop a transforming tool, DeIdiom, to automatically transform idiomatic code into equivalent non-idiomatic code. We test and review over 7,572 idiomatic code instances of nine pythonic idioms (list/set/diet-comprehension, chain-comparison, truth-value-test, loop-else, assign-multi-targets, for-multi-targets, star), the result shows the high accuracy of DeIdiom.

They either learn to construct plans from scratch in a bottom-up manner or steer the plan generation behavior of traditional optimizer using hints. While these methods have achieved some success, they face challenges in either low training efficiency or limited plan search space. To address these challenges, we introduce FOSS, a novel framework for query optimization based on deep reinforcement learning. FOSS initiates optimization from the original plan generated by a traditional optimizer and incrementally refines suboptimal nodes of the plan through a sequence of actions. Additionally, we devise an asymmetric advantage model to evaluate the advantage between two plans. We integrate it with a traditional optimizer to form a simulated environment. Leveraging this simulated environment, FOSS can bootstrap itself to rapidly generate a large amount of high-quality simulated experiences. FOSS then learns from these experiences to improve its optimization capability. We evaluate the performance of FOSS on Join Order Benchmark, TPC-DS, and Stack Overflow. The experimental results demonstrate that FOSS outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of latency performance.

The paper demonstrates this methodology with large language models for code generation. A benchmark called ScenEval is constructed from problems in textbooks, an online tutorial website and Stack Overflow. Filtering by scenario is demonstrated and the test sets are used to evaluate ChatGPT for Java code generation. Our experiments found that the performance of ChatGPT decreases with the complexity of the coding task. It is weakest for advanced topics like multi-threading, data structure algorithms and recursive methods. The Java code generated by ChatGPT tends to be much shorter than reference solution in terms of number of lines, while it is more likely to be more complex in both cyclomatic and cognitive complexity metrics, if the generated code is correct. However, the generated code is more likely to be less complex than the reference solution if the code is incorrect.","2835-3560","979-8-3503-6505-4","10.1109/AITest62860.2024.00015","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10685215","Machine learning;Large language models;ChatGPT;Code Generation;Benchmark;Performance evaluation;Scenario-based testing","Measurement;Java;Codes;Tutorials;Manuals;Metadata;Benchmark testing","","","","28","IEEE","25 Sep 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

MicroRec utilizes a dual-encoder architecture that combines contrastive learning and semantic similarity learning, allowing us to achieve robust and accurate retrieval and ranking of relevant posts based on user queries. Using LLMs, MicroRec builds up a deep understanding of both user queries and microservices through the information they provide (e.g., README files and Dockerfiles). Our empirical evaluations demonstrate significant improvements brought by MicroRec over the existing methods across a variety of performance metrics including MRR, MAP, and precision@k. In addition, the results returned by MicroRec were fourteen times more accurate than those provided by the existing recommendation tool on the widely-used Docker Hub platform.CCS CONCEPTS• Computing methodologies → Semantic networks; Natural language processing; • Applied computing → Document searching; • Information systems → Recommender systems.","2574-3864","979-8-4007-0587-8","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10555678","Microservices;Recommendation System;Semantic Search;Large Language Models;Docker Hub","Measurement;Accuracy;Semantics;Microservice architectures;Software;Natural language processing;Data mining","","","","37","","18 Jun 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Deciding which design pattern to use for a given software problem often requires practical knowledge acquired with experience in a similar domain and can be highly subjective and error-prone. Further, for novice programmers, an automated approach would be of tremendous help as it would provide practical knowledge required for deciding which design pattern to use for a particular software problem. The majority of research in software design pattern prediction involves using software structure and features in determining which design pattern to implement. However, there are circumstances where software engineers would prefer to know which design pattern to be used by looking at the design problem during or before the implementation phase. Existing design pattern prediction tools cannot be utilized in this scenario due to the absence of code and class structures. To address this issue, this paper proposes a new approach that analyzes the context of the software problem from text and predicts a suitable design pattern for the given problem context using feature learning, neural embedding, and classification. We evaluate our approach on a case study from Stack Overflow with more than 66,000 questions that discuss problems and consequences related to 23 design patterns. Results show that our approach can predict design patterns from the text with 82% overall accuracy.","2151-0830","978-1-4503-8128-4","10.1145/3417113.3423372","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9319300","Software Design Patterns;Feature learning;Classification;Neural Embedding","Software;Training;Predictive models;Software design;Programming;Data mining;Natural languages","","","","23","","20 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, like any other software system, DRL-based software systems are susceptible to faults that pose unique challenges for debugging and diagnosing. These faults often result in unexpected behavior without explicit failures and error messages, making debugging difficult and time-consuming. Therefore, automating the monitoring and diagnosis of DRL systems is crucial to alleviate the burden on developers. In this paper, we propose RLExplorer, the first fault diagnosis approach for DRL-based software systems. RLExplorer automatically monitors training traces and runs diagnosis routines based on properties of the DRL learning dynamics to detect the occurrence of DRL-specific faults. It then logs the results of these diagnoses as warnings that cover theoretical concepts, recommended practices, and potential solutions to the identified faults. We conducted two sets of evaluations to assess RLExplorer. Our first evaluation of faulty DRL samples from Stack Overflow revealed that our approach can effectively diagnose real faults in 83% of the cases. Our second evaluation of RLExplorer with 15 DRL experts/developers showed that (1) RLExplorer could identify 3.6 times more defects than manual debugging and (2) RLExplorer is easily integrated into DRL applications.","2576-3148","979-8-3503-9568-6","10.1109/ICSME58944.2024.00019","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10795107","Deep Reinforcement Learning;DRL Bugs;Fault Diagnosis;Software tools;Software Engineering","Fault diagnosis;Training;Video games;Software maintenance;Runtime;Debugging;Manuals;Software systems;Deep reinforcement learning;Monitoring","","","","82","IEEE","19 Dec 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper presents a controlled experiment that explores ChatGPT's role in CS1 in a classroom setting. Specifically, we aim to investigate the impact of ChatGPT on student learning outcomes and their behaviors when working on programming assignments. Participants were tasked with creating a UML diagram and subsequently implementing its design through programming, followed by a closed-book post-evaluation and a post-survey. All the participants were required to screen-record the whole process. In total, 56 participants were recruited, with 48 successful screen recordings. Participants in the Experimental Group can access ChatGPT 3.5 and other online resources, such as Google and Stack Overflow when creating the UML diagram and programming; however, participants in the Control Group can access all online resources except for ChatGPT (i.e., the only design variable is the access to ChatGPT). Finally, we measured and analyzed participants' learning outcomes through their UML diagram, programming, and post-evaluation scores. We also analyzed the time participants took to complete the tasks and their interactions with ChatGPT and other resources from the screen recordings. After finishing the tasks, student participants also provided their perceptions of using ChatGPT in CS1 through a post-survey. With rigorous quantitative and qualitative analysis, we found that (1) using ChatGPT does not present a significant impact on students' learning performance in the CS1 assignment-style tasks; (2) once using ChatGPT, students' tendency to explore other traditional educational resources is largely reduced (though available) and they tend to rely solely on ChatGPT, and this reliance on ChatGPT did not guarantee enhanced learning performance; (3) the majority of students hold neutral views on ChatGPT's role in CS1 programming but most of them raised concerns about its potential ethical issues and inconsistent performance across different tasks. We hope this study can help educators and students better understand the impact of ChatGPT in CS1 and inspire future work to provide proper guidelines for using ChatGPT in introductory programming classes.","2832-7578","979-8-4007-0498-7","10.1145/3639474.3640076","NSF(grant numbers:CCF-2211429); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10554703","CS education;CS1;Generative AI;ChatGPT;OOP","Training;Ethics;Generative AI;Unified modeling language;Chatbots;Recording;Computer science education","","","","39","","19 Jun 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The users, however, often need packages from different repositories, and thus may suffer from compatibility issues. We refer to these issues as Cross-repository Compatibility (CC) issues. Existing works typically focus on a single software repository and are insufficient to detect CC issues.To fill this gap, we use both Python and Ubuntu repositories as representatives to study the root cause of CC issues, then summarize their triggering patterns and failure symptoms. Guided by the above analysis, we design Hera, an automatic tool to solve CC issues. Hera first builds a cross-repository compatibility database offline, and then online predicts, detects and fixes CC issues in the user’s system environment.

Such images could therefore be used as prior information to summarize videos containing a similar set of objects. In this work, we apply our novel insight to develop a summarization algorithm that uses the web-image based prior information in an unsupervised manner.

This paper proposes “FreeLoc”, an efficient localization method addressing three major technical issues posed in crowdsourcing based systems. Our novel solution facilitates 1) extracting accurate fingerprint values from short RSS measurement times 2) calibration-free positioning across different devices and 3) maintaining a single fingerprint for each location in a radio map, irrespective of any number of uploaded data sets for a given location. Through experiments using four different smartphones, we evaluate our new indoor positioning method.

We present TVSum, an unsupervised video summarization framework that uses title-based image search results to find visually important shots. We observe that a video title is often carefully chosen to be maximally descriptive of its main topic, and hence images related to the title can serve as a proxy for important visual concepts of the main topic. However, because titles are free-formed, unconstrained, and often written ambiguously, images searched using the title can contain noise (images irrelevant to video content) and variance (images of different topics). To deal with this challenge, we developed a novel co-archetypal analysis technique that learns canonical visual concepts shared between video and images, but not in either alone, by finding a joint-factorial representation of two data sets. We introduce a new benchmark dataset, TVSum50, that contains 50 videos and their shot-level importance scores annotated via crowdsourcing. Experimental results on two datasets, SumMe and TVSum50, suggest our approach produces superior quality summaries compared to several recently proposed approaches.","1063-6919","978-1-4673-6964-0","10.1109/CVPR.2015.7299154","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7299154","","Videos;Yttrium;Visualization;Optimization;Approximation methods;Crowdsourcing;Focusing","","167","","52","IEEE","15 Oct 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In particular in case of bad network conditions, network and service providers have to trade off between these two impairment types, i.e. between the devil and the deep blue sea. In this paper we investigate this tradeoff in order to guide the design and development of Internet applications and network management approaches. The contribution of this paper is twofold. Firstly, we quantify the impact of initial delays on the user perceived Quality of Experience (QoE) for different application scenarios by means of subjective laboratory and crowdsourcing studies. We show that QoE for a given waiting time strongly depends on the concrete application at hand but that rating diversity remains fairly application-invariant. Secondly, using the example of YouTube video streaming we compare the influence of initial delays and interruptions (stallings) during watching. Our results demonstrate that users are extremely sensitive to interruptions and that services should be designed accordingly e.g. by increasing initial delay for prebuffering to overcome lack of resources.","","978-1-4673-0726-0","10.1109/QoMEX.2012.6263849","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6263849","","Delay;Streaming media;YouTube;Internet;Authentication;Laboratories","","166","1","23","IEEE","9 Aug 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As a result, different people with the same age can have quite different appearances due to different rates of facial aging. We propose a hierarchical approach for automatic age estimation, and provide an analysis of how aging influences individual facial components. Experimental results on the FG-NET, MORPH Album2, and PCSO databases show that eyes and nose are more informative than the other facial components in automatic age estimation.

Developing new solutions for SED often relies on the availability of strongly labeled audio recordings, where the annotation includes the onset, offset and source of every event. Generating such precise annotations manually is very time consuming, and as a result existing datasets for SED with strong labels are scarce and limited in size. To address this issue, we present Scaper, an open-source library for soundscape synthesis and augmentation. Given a collection of iso-lated sound events, Scaper acts as a high-level sequencer that can generate multiple soundscapes from a single, probabilistically defined, “specification”. To increase the variability of the output, Scaper supports the application of audio transformations such as pitch shifting and time stretching individually to every event. To illustrate the potential of the library, we generate a dataset of 10,000 sound-scapes and use it to compare the performance of two state-of-the-art algorithms, including a breakdown by soundscape characteristics.

We study how mobile CPU designs trends have impacted the end-user, hardware design, and the holistic mobile device. We analyze the evolution often cutting-edge mobile CPU designs released over the past seven years. Specifically, we report measured performance, power, energy and user satisfaction trends across mobile CPU generations. A key contribution of our work is that we contextualize the mobile CPU's evolution in terms of user satisfaction, which has largely been absent from prior mobile hardware studies. To bridge the gap between mobile CPU design and user satisfaction, we construct and conduct a novel crowdsourcing study that spans over 25,000 survey participants using the Amazon Mechanical Turk service. Our methodology allows us to identify what mobile CPU design techniques provide the most benefit to the end-user's quality of user experience. Our results quantitatively demonstrate that CPUs play a crucial role in modern mobile system-on-chips (SoCs). Over the last seven years, both single-and multicore performance improvements have contributed to end-user satisfaction by reducing user-critical application response latencies. Mobile CPUs aggressively adopted many power-hungry desktop-oriented design techniques to reach these performance levels. Unlike other smartphone components (e.g. display and radio) whose peak power consumption has decreased over time, the mobile CPU's peak power consumption has steadily increased. As the limits of technology scaling restrict the ability of desktop-like scaling to continue for mobile CPUs, specialized accelerators appear to be a promising alternative that can help sustain the power, performance, and energy improvements that mobile computing necessitates. Such a paradigm shift will redefine the role of the CPU within future SoCs, which merit several design considerations based on our findings.","2378-203X","978-1-4673-9211-2","10.1109/HPCA.2016.7446054","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7446054","","Mobile communication;Market research;Multicore processing;Hardware;Benchmark testing;Power demand;Technological innovation","","103","","60","IEEE","4 Apr 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The goal of the player (i.e., the decision maker) here is to maximize the cumulative reward in the face of uncertainty. However, the basic MAB model neglects several important factors of the system in many realworld applications, where multiple arms (i.e., actions) can be simultaneously played and an arm could sometimes be “sleeping” (i.e., unavailable). Besides reward maximization, ensuring fairness is also a key design concern in practice. To that end, we propose a new Combinatorial Sleeping MAB model with Fairness constraints, called CSMAB-F, aiming to address the aforementioned crucial modeling issues. The objective is now to maximize the reward while satisfying the fairness requirement of a minimum selection fraction for each individual arm. To tackle this new problem, we extend an online learning algorithm, called Upper Confidence Bound (UCB), to deal with a critical tradeoff between exploitation and exploration and employ the virtual queue technique to properly handle the fairness constraints. By carefully integrating these two techniques, we develop a new algorithm, called Learning with Fairness Guarantee (LFG), for the CSMAB-F problem. Further, we rigorously prove that not only LFG is feasibility-optimal, but it also has a time-average regret upper bounded by N/2η + β1√mNT log T +β2N/T, where N is the total T number of arms, m is the maximum number of arms that can be simultaneously played, T is the time horizon, β1 and β2 are constants, and η is a design parameter that we can tune. Finally, we perform extensive simulations to corroborate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. Interestingly, the simulation results reveal an important tradeoff between the regret and the speed of convergence to a point satisfying the fairness constraints.","2641-9874","978-1-7281-0515-4","10.1109/INFOCOM.2019.8737461","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8737461","","Stochastic processes;Resource management;Simulation;Wireless communication;Optimization;Crowdsourcing;Face","","58","","31","IEEE","17 Jun 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the existing GPM methods do not consider the multiple constraints on edges in GQ, which are commonly exist in various applications such as, crowdsourcing travel, social network based e-commerce and study group selection, etc. In this paper, we first conceptually extend Bounded Simulation to Multi-Constrained Simulation (MCS), and propose a novel NP-Complete Multi-Constrained Graph Pattern Matching (MC-GPM) problem. Then, to address the efficiency issue in large-scale MC-GPM, we propose a new concept called Strong Social Component (SSC), consisting of participants with strong social connections. We also propose an approach to identify SSCs, and propose a novel index method and a graph compression method for SSC. Moreover, we devise a heuristic algorithm to identify MC-GPM results effectively and efficiently without decompressing graphs. An extensive empirical study on five real-world large-scale social graphs has demonstrated the effectiveness, efficiency and scalability of our approach.","2375-026X","978-1-4799-7964-6","10.1109/ICDE.2015.7113297","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7113297","","Pattern matching;Social network services;Indexes;Data models;Context;Time complexity;Data mining","","54","","34","IEEE","1 Jun 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Most of current solutions rely on Received Signal Strength (RSS) of wireless signals as location fingerprint, to discriminate locations of interest. Fingerprint uniqueness with respect to locations is a basic requirement in these fingerprinting-based solutions. However, due to insufficient number of signal sources, temporal variations of wireless signals, and rich multipath effects, such requirement is not always met in complex indoor environments, which we refer to as fingerprint ambiguity. In this work, we explore the potential of leveraging user motion against fingerprint ambiguity. Our basic idea is that user motion patterns collected by built-in sensors of mobile phones add to the diversity built by RSS fingerprints. On this basis, we propose MoLoc, a motion-assisted localization scheme implemented on mobile phones. MoLoc can easily be integrated in existing localization systems by simply adding a motion database that is constructed automatically by crowdsourcing. We conducted experiments in a large office hall. The experiment results show that MoLoc doubles the localization accuracy achieved by the fingerprinting method, and limits the mean localization error to less than 1m.","1063-6927","978-0-7695-5000-8","10.1109/ICDCS.2013.41","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6681592","Indoor Localization;User Motion;RSS Fingerprint;Crowdsourcing","Databases;Mobile handsets;Accuracy;IEEE 802.11 Standards;Sensors;Hidden Markov models;Fingerprint recognition","","52","1","26","IEEE","12 Dec 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Meanwhile, short online videos shared on social media platforms, or micro-videos, have arisen as a new medium for creative expression. In this paper we study creative micro-videos in an effort to understand the features that make a video creative, and to address the problem of automatic detection of creative content. Defining creative videos as those that are novel and have aesthetic value, we conduct a crowdsourcing experiment to create a dataset of over 3, 800 micro-videos labelled as creative and non-creative. We propose a set of computational features that we map to the components of our definition of creativity, and conduct an analysis to determine which of these features correlate most with creative video. Finally, we evaluate a supervised approach to automatically detect creative video, with promising results, showing that it is necessary to model both aesthetic value and novelty to achieve optimal classification accuracy.","1063-6919","978-1-4799-5118-5","10.1109/CVPR.2014.544","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6909940","computational aesthetics;video creativity;microvideo analysis","Videos;Visualization;Feature extraction;Computational modeling;Media;Cameras;Blogs","","51","","32","IEEE","25 Sep 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A fundamental problem in social sensing applications lies in effectively ascertaining the correctness of claims and the reliability of data sources without knowing either of them a priori, which is referred to as truth discovery. While significant progress has been made to solve the truth discovery problem, some important challenges have not been well addressed yet. First, existing truth discovery solutions did not fully solve the dynamic truth discovery problem where the ground truth of claims changes over time. Second, many current solutions are not scalable to large-scale social sensing events because of the centralized nature of their truth discovery algorithms. Third, the heterogeneity and unpredictability of the social sensing data traffic pose additional challenges to the resource allocation and system responsiveness. In this paper, we developed a Scalable Streaming Truth Discovery (SSTD) solution to address the above challenges. In this paper, we developed a Scalable Streaming Truth Discovery (SSTD) solution to address the above challenges. In particular, we first developed a dynamic truth discovery scheme based on Hidden Markov Models (HMM) to effectively infer the evolving truth of reported claims. We further developed a distributed framework to implement the dynamic truth discovery scheme using Work Queue in HTCondor system. We also integrated the SSTD scheme with an optimal workload allocation mechanism to dynamically allocate the resources (e.g., cores, memories) to the truth discovery tasks based on their computation requirements. We evaluated SSTD through real world social sensing applications using Twitter data feeds. The evaluation results on three real-world data traces (i.e., Boston Bombing, Paris Shooting and College Football) show that the SSTD scheme is scalable and outperforms the state-of-the-art truth discovery methods in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency.","1063-6927","978-1-5386-1792-2","10.1109/ICDCS.2017.196","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7980038","Crowdsourcing;Socical Sensing;Truth Discovery;Distributed Computing;Control Theory;Hidden Markov Model","Sensors;Reliability;Hidden Markov models;Twitter;Scalability;Aerodynamics","","50","","46","IEEE","17 Jul 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A key difficulty is the lack of well annotated large scale datasets. Most existing datasets only provide a limited number of annotations for good views, while ignoring the comparative nature of view selection. In this work, we present the first large scale Comparative Photo Composition dataset, which contains over one million comparative view pairs annotated using a cost-effective crowdsourcing workflow. We show that these comparative view annotations are essential for training a robust neural network model for composition. In addition, we propose a novel knowledge transfer framework to train a fast view proposal network, which runs at 75+ FPS and achieves state-of-the-art performance in image cropping and thumbnail generation tasks on three benchmark datasets. The superiority of our method is also demonstrated in a user study on a challenging experiment, where our method significantly outperforms the baseline methods in producing diversified well-composed views.","2575-7075","978-1-5386-6420-9","10.1109/CVPR.2018.00570","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8578668","","Proposals;Training;Agriculture;Task analysis;Knowledge transfer;Protocols;Virtual private networks","","50","","49","IEEE","16 Dec 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, customers of video services usually watch longer sequences of videos which are more and more delivered via adaptive streaming methods such as HTTP adaptive streaming (HAS). A viewing session in such a setting contains several different video qualities over time. In order to express this in an overall score for the whole viewing session, several temporal pooling methods have been proposed in the related work. Within this paper, we set out to compare the performance of different temporal pooling methods for the prediction of Quality of Experience (QoE) for HTTP video streams with varying qualities. We perform this comparison based on ground truth rating data gathered in a crowdsourcing study in the context of the NGMN P-SERQU project. As input data for the models, we use objective video quality metrics such as PSNR, SSIM but also very basic inputs such as the bitrate of the clips only. Our results show that certain pooling methods perform clearly better than others. These results can help in identifying well performing temporal pooling methods in the context of HAS.","","978-1-4799-0738-0","10.1109/QoMEX.2013.6603210","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6603210","adaptive streaming;HTTP streaming;video QoE;temporal pooling;mobile video;variable video quality","Streaming media;PSNR;Video recording;Quality assessment;Bit rate;Video sequences","","46","","21","IEEE","19 Sep 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
