The challenge for the public transportation system is that its demands are non linear and the passengers' experience depends on many human factors. UnCrowdTPG is a mobile service and a research platform that has been developed for understanding the mobility patterns of the users of public transportation services in Geneva (TPG), as well as their experience with respect to the crowds perceived aboard the vehicles. UnCrowdTPG models algorithmically this experience using crowdsourcing techniques and it provides to the individual estimations of the future expected experiences aboard, thus enabling them to better plan their journeys with respect to the crowds. In this paper we position the UnCrowdTPG service as a research platform. Additionally we discuss the research questions in areas like local governance and public healthcare supported by the data analysed collectively from all UnCrowdTPG users. We also discuss the challenges for implementing the truly smart transportation system in a small-sized European city like Geneva.","2160-4894","978-1-4799-5041-6","10.1109/WiMOB.2014.6962141","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6962141","Intelligent Transportation System;crowdsourcing;smart city;user experience;mobility patterns;crowd;public health","Vehicles;Cities and towns;Mobile communication;Estimation;Real-time systems;Educational institutions","","4","","17","IEEE","24 Nov 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Many research works have used mobility generators to simulate realistic mobility, and evaluated the performance and reliability of the proposed applications and protocols. Although such mobility generators might be useful for producing typical mobility patterns, those mobility patterns are just snapshots and they cover only some part in the possible mobility patterns. Since many S&CC applications are used as social systems, their reliability and efficiency are very important. In order to improve the reliability of such mobility aware applications and accurately evaluate their performance, we need to collect many mobility patterns via simulation and/or observation from the real world, analyze their mobility influence statistically and provide adequate design platforms. In this paper, we first show the fact that many research works adopt snapshot-based mobility analyses.

The number of both vehicle miles traveled and traffic accidents has increased in the past two years, and is mainly attributed to human error, mainly due to inattentiveness during hazardous driving situations. By crowdsourcing traffic data (e.g. vehicle position, speed, direction, etc.) through vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication, connected vehicles (CV) can detect upcoming hazards at lane level with reasonable lead time. The work described in this paper aimed to develop and simulate an innovative V2V-based application to perform lane-level hazard prediction, and a corresponding driver response model. The concept of Lane Hazard Prediction (LHP) is to improve the mobility and safety of both individual users and the entire traffic system. LHP identifies the position of a downstream lane-level hazard (within seconds after it occurs) based on a spatial and temporal data mining and machine learning techniques. It then guides the LHP-equipped vehicles with recommended lateral maneuvers to avoid traffic jams resulting from the hazards. Simulation results demonstrate reliable hazard prediction, even when the V2V penetration rate is as low as 20%. A comprehensive evaluation of the developed LHP application from the perspectives of both user benefits and system benefits has been conducted over different CV penetration rates. The results demonstrate that the proposed LHP application can significantly improve both the safety and mobility performance of the equipped vehicles without compromising the mobility and safety performance of the overall traffic.","2153-0017","978-1-7281-0323-5","10.1109/ITSC.2018.8569340","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8569340","","Hazards;Predictive models;Mathematical model;Vehicles;Logistics;Analytical models","","4","","16","IEEE","9 Dec 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

By crowdsourcing a large population of individual car owners, it can provide more flexible services with a lower serving cost, comparing with the traditional taxi system. Due to the autonomous nature of car owners (drivers), a decentralized driver dispatching algorithm that can achieve a stable (self-motivated) and optimal passenger-driver matching is highly desired for a ride-sharing system. In this paper, we will study such a driver dispatching algorithm systematically. We first show that the optimal passenger-driver matching achieved by the centralized driver dispatching algorithm is often not stable, in the sense that some drivers and passengers may break with their matched partners and form new matching pairs. To this end, we introduce a virtual order fee on each passenger (which the platform will charge the drives who want to serve the passenger) to motivate the behaviors of drivers. Specifically, we propose a novel auction-based decentralized driver dispatching algorithm, where each driver proposes the most profitable passenger that he wants to serve, considering the potential profit that he can achieve and the order fee that he needs to pay from/to serving each passenger. The virtual order fee on a passenger will be gradually increased when multiple drivers want to serve the passenger, until there exists only one driver who is willing to serve. We analytically show that such a decentralized driver dispatching algorithm will converge to an equilibrium (stable) outcome, which achieves the optimal passenger-driver matching (i.e., that maximizes the social income of the whole system). Simulation results further show how the converging speed and the achieved social income change with the system parameters such as the step size of order fee increasement. Moreover, it is easy to implement the proposed distributed algorithm in a practical system.","2155-6814","978-1-5386-5580-1","10.1109/MASS.2018.00027","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8567549","ride sharing;stable matching","Public transportation;Distributed algorithms;Dispatching;Real-time systems;Servers;Automobiles","","4","","23","IEEE","9 Dec 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

While these biases need to be considered when designing any empirical study, they can be particularly significant in the context of replication studies which can stray from the studies being replicated in only a few admissible ways. Although there are general guidelines for making valid, unbiased choices in each of the several steps in experimental design, making such choices when conducting replication studies has not been well explored. We reviewed 16 replication studies in information visualization published in four top venues between 2008 to present to characterize how the study designs of the replication studies differed from those of the studies they replicated. We present our characterization categories which include the prevalence of crowdsourcing, and the commonly-found replication types and study-design differences. We draw guidelines based on these categories towards helping researchers make meaningful and unbiased decisions when designing replication studies.

With the gadget, tourist can find information about the destination, or supporting information like transportation, hotel, weather and exchange rate. They need prediction of traveling and visiting time, to arrange their journey. If traveling time has predicted accurately by Google Map using the location feature, visiting time has another issue. Until today, Google detects the user's position based on crowdsourcing data from customer visits to a specific location over the last several weeks. It cannot be denied that this method will give a valid information for the tourists. However, because it needs a lot of data, there are many destinations that have no information about visiting time. From the case study that we used, there are 626 destinations in East Java, Indonesia, and from that amount only 224 destinations or 35.78% has the visiting time. To complete the information and help tourists, this research developed the prediction model for visiting time. For the first data is tested statistically to make sure the model development was using the right method. Multiple linear regression become the common model, because there are six factors that influenced the visiting time, i.e. access, government, rating, number of reviews, number of pictures, and other information. Those factors become the independent variables to predict dependent variable or visiting time. From normality test as the linear regression requirement, the significant value was less than p that means the data cannot pass the statistic test, even though we transformed the data based on the skewness. Because of three of them are ordinal data and the others are interval data, we tried to exclude and include the ordinal by transform it to interval. We also used the Ordinal Logistic Regression by transform the interval data in dependent variable into ordinal data using Expectation Maximization, one of clustering algorithm in machine learning, but the model still did not fit even though we used 5 functions. Then we used the classification algorithm in machine learning by using 5 top algorithm which are Linear Regression, k-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree, Support Vector Machines, and Multi-Layer Perceptron. Based on maximum correlation coefficient and minimum root mean square error, Linear Regression with 6 independent variables has the best result with the correlation coefficient 20.41% and root mean square error 48.46%.

Authorship identification can be used in a wide range of software domains, e.g., code authorship disputes, plagiarism detection, exposure of attackers’ identity. Besides the inherent challenges from legacy software development, framework programming and crowdsourcing mode in Android raise the difficulties of authorship identification significantly. More specifically, widespread third party libraries and inherited components (e.g., classes, methods, and variables) dilute the primary code within the entire Android app and blur the boundaries of code written by different authors. However, prior research has not well addressed these challenges.To this end, we design a two-phased approach to attribute the primary code of an Android app to the specific developer. In the first phase, we put forward three types of strategies to identify the relationships between Java packages in an app, which consist of context, semantic and structural relationships. A package aggregation algorithm is developed to cluster all packages that are of high probability written by the same authors. In the second phase, we develop three types of features to capture authors’ coding habits and code stylometry. Based on that, we generate fingerprints for an author from its developed Android apps and employ several machine learning algorithms for authorship classification. We evaluate our approach in three datasets that contain 15,666 apps from 257 distinct developers and achieve a 92.5% accuracy rate on average.

Hence, how to achieve image privacy-preserving while guaranteeing to reconstruct a complete 3D model is important and significant.

In this paper, we leverage the G PS traces of commuters to infer five different transportation modes frequently used in urban areas including foot, bike, bus, car and metro. We compare three different approaches commonly reported in the literature for transportation mode detection from the family of machine learning algorithms (random forest -RF) and deep learning architectures (convolutional neural network -CNN and ensemble of autoencoders -EAE). By splitting the dataset into train-test by the period of data collection, as well as the conventional 80–20 split, we evaluate the impact of several data pre-processing decisions on overall classifiers' performance.

In this paper, we conduct crowdsourcing experiments to investigate this impact on both the annotations themselves and on the performance of these algorithms. We focus on one critical question: the effect of context. We present a new emotion dataset, Multimodal Stressed Emotion (MuSE), and annotate the dataset using two conditions: randomized, in which annotators are presented with clips in random order, and contextualized, in which annotators are presented with clips in order. We find that contextual labeling schemes result in annotations that are more similar to a speaker's own self-reported labels and that labels generated from randomized schemes are most easily predictable by automated systems.","2379-190X","978-1-4799-8131-1","10.1109/ICASSP.2019.8682793","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8682793","emotion;crowdsourcing;annotation;emotion perception;classifier performance","Labeling;Crowdsourcing;Stress;Emotion recognition;Reliability;Training;Task analysis","","4","","30","IEEE","17 Apr 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Alternative workforce refers to a pool of workers who work for the organization as contract workers or as crowd workers for a set of specific tasks or duration. Adoption of crowd workers as an alternative workforce is gaining a lot of attention these days. However, it is still not widely adopted by big organizations because of the concerns related to quality, timeliness, and confidentiality. A partial adoption of crowd workforce is a natural next step to leverage the benefits of crowdsourcing. The above partial adoption creates a hybrid workforce structure where different type of workers, such as full time employees, contractors, and crowd workers, work for the organization. A number of challenges need to be addressed for the above model to succeed. For instance, hiring right workers, establishing a proper collaboration among the workers distributed across geographies, and assessing the workers for confidentiality and privacy. This paper proposes a platform that alleviates some of the above challenges. We present a pilot performed on the platform and initial experiences gained from the adoption of the platform.","2329-6313","978-1-5090-2680-7","10.1109/ICGSE.2016.16","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7577414","Crowdsourcing;software development;workforce","Organizations;Crowdsourcing;Software;Software engineering;Collaboration;Context;Monitoring","","4","","28","IEEE","29 Sep 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Manufacturers thus use perceptual quality criteria throughout the development of smartphone cameras. This costly procedure can be partially replaced by automated learning-based methods for image quality assessment (IQA). Due to its subjective nature, it is necessary to estimate and guarantee the consistency of the IQA process, a characteristic lacking in the mean opinion scores (MOS) widely used for crowdsourcing IQA. In addition, existing blind IQA (BIQA) datasets pay little attention to the difficulty of cross-content assessment, which may degrade the quality of annotations. This paper introduces PIQ23, a portrait-specific IQA dataset of 5116 images of 50 predefined scenarios acquired by 100 smartphones, covering a high variety of brands, models, and use cases. The dataset includes individuals of various genders and ethnicities who have given explicit and informed consent for their photographs to be used in public research. It is annotated by pairwise comparisons (PWC) collected from over 30 image quality experts for three image attributes: face detail preservation, face target exposure, and overall image quality. An in-depth statistical analysis of these annotations allows us to evaluate their consistency over PIQ23. Finally, we show through an extensive comparison with existing baselines that semantic information (image context) can be used to improve IQA predictions.

For these two problems, the common theme is how to `match' an arriving left vertex in an online fashion with any of the available right vertices, if at all, so as to maximize the sum of the value of the matched edges, subject to satisfying a sum-weight constraint on the matched left vertices. Assuming that the left vertices arrive in an uniformly random order (secretary model), two almost similar algorithms are proposed for the two problems, that are 2e competitive and 24 competitive, respectively. The proposed online bipartite matching algorithm is also shown to be truthful: there is no incentive for any left vertex to misreport its bid/weight. Direct applications of these problems include job allocation with load balancing, generalized adwords, crowdsourcing auctions, and matching wireless users to cooperative relays in device-to-device communication enabled cellular network.","","978-1-5090-5336-0","10.1109/INFOCOM.2017.8057223","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8057223","","Device-to-device communication;Impedance matching;Conferences;Resource management;Load management;Crowdsourcing;Wireless communication","","4","","23","IEEE","5 Oct 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The automatic digitization of these historical documents is a complex machine learning process that usually produces poor results, requiring costly interventions by experts, who have to transcribe and interpret the content. This paper describes hybrid (Human- and Machine-Intelligent) workflows for scientific data extraction, combining machine-learning and crowdsourcing software elements. Our results demonstrate that the mix of human and machine processes has advantages in data extraction time and quality, when compared to a machine-only workflow. More specifically, we show how OCRopus and Tesseract, two widely used open source Optical Character Recognition (OCR) tools, can improve their accuracy by more than 42%, when text areas are cropped by humans prior to OCR, while the total time can increase or decrease depending on the OCR selection. The digitization of 400 images, with Entomology, Bryophyte, and Lichen specimens, is evaluated following four different approaches: processing the whole specimen image (machine-only), processing crowd cropped labels (hybrid), processing crowd cropped fields (hybrid), and cleaning the machine-only output.

Many existing solutions rely on noisy magnetic and inertial sensor data, leading to limited accuracy, while others leverage multiple, dense anchor points to improve the accuracy, requiring significant deployment efforts. This paper presents LiCompass, the first system that enables a commodity camera to accurately estimate the object orientation using just a single optical anchor. Our key idea is to allow a camera to observe varying intensity level of polarized light when it is in different orientations and, hence, perform estimation directly from image pixel intensity. As the estimation relies only on pixel intensity, instead of the location of the anchor in an image, the system performs reliably at long distance, with low resolution images, and with large perspective distortion. LiCompass' core designs include an elaborate optical anchor design and a series of signal processing techniques based on trigonometric properties, which extend the range of orientation estimation to full 360 degrees. Our prototype evaluation shows that LiCompass produces very accurate estimates with median errors of merely 2.5 degrees at 5 meters and 7.4 degrees at 2.5 meters with an irradiance angle of 55 degrees.","","978-1-5090-5336-0","10.1109/INFOCOM.2017.8057100","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8057100","","Cameras;Estimation;Optical polarization;Adaptive optics;Optical imaging;Optical distortion;Optical receivers","","4","","31","IEEE","5 Oct 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Furthermore, consumer preferences allow ranking of different assumptions about products or services based on the expected or to-be-experienced satisfaction of consuming them. In our previous work, we proposed a conceptualization of consumer preferences - the Consumer Preference Meta-Model (CPMM) - to enable a classification and ranking of the preferences that would be the basis for deciding which of would be considered to be developed into supporting information systems/services. In this study we collect consumer preferences through crowdsourcing, and in particular Twitter, because of its increasing popularity as a source of up-to-date comments and information about current services and products. The tweets of four major American airlines were processed using different techniques from natural language processing (NLP) that enabled the classification of their objectives, content, and importance within CPMM.

In this paper, we present a credentialing system called TrustForge, which enables effective and flexible access control for the AVMcrowd-sourced repository. Credentialing systems are essential in crowdsourcing to ensure quality, since it is potentially open to contributions made by anyone. The open source software community has developed elaborate manual approaches of managing its contributor community, which are often very labor-intensive and inefficient. Our aim with TrustForge is to improve the automation of the credentialing and access control process in the context of component-based systems, where users contribute components at various levels of abstraction. TrustForge takes a hybrid approach that combines trust policy and reputation to address this problem. In TrustForge, a policy language is used to specify the access control rules for users in the system to contribute components. In addition, reputation values computed for users based on the quality of their past component contributions are used to tune the static policies to enable flexibility and adaptiveness. The contributions of this work are as follows: (1) the design of TrustForge - an effective and flexible access control mechanism that combines policy and reputation approaches; (2) the identification of heuristics for component quality measurement and a novel reputation computation algorithm for evaluating user trustworthiness; (3) a data model based on provenance graphs that allows efficient repository information storage and retrieve. We have implemented TrustForge system and integrate it with the VehicleForge repository system to support the operation of the AVM challenge program. The evaluation results based on realworld deployment and systematic simulation demonstrate that TrustForge can effectively discern the trustworthiness of users within the crowd-sourced system.","","978-1-4673-5839-2","10.1109/PST.2013.6596065","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6596065","","Access control;Algorithm design and analysis;Software quality;Open source software;History;Vehicles","","4","1","22","IEEE","12 Sep 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It does not rely on any Wi-Fi infrastructure, and does not need to war-drive the metro line. Leveraging crowdsourcing, we collect accelerometer, magnetometer and barometer readings on smartphones, and analyze these sensor data to extract patterns. Through advanced data manipulating techniques, we build the pattern map for the entire metro line, which can then be used for localization. We conduct field studies to demonstrate the accuracy, scalability, and robustness of M-Loc. The results of our field studies in 3 metro lines with 55 stations show that M-Loc achieves an accuracy of 93% when travelling 3 stations, 98% when travelling 5 stations.","","978-1-4799-4786-7","10.1109/WoWMoM.2014.6918958","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6918958","Metro train;smartphone;localization;barometer;magnetometer","Acceleration;IEEE 802.11 Standards;Mobile communication;Accelerometers;Magnetometers;Pattern matching;Fingerprint recognition","","4","","21","IEEE","9 Oct 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

With the diversity of people using eLS, there is a need for continuous improvement, and software development teams need to better understand the stakeholders' requirements for faster delivery, enhancement, or personalization of eLS. Requirements elicitation is an activity within requirements engineering that is concerned with discovering needs of stakeholders, either for software development from scratch or evolution. In this paper we identify the special properties of eLS that characterize them from other software systems to help with better understanding of such domain, discuss the special requirements elicitation challenges that the special properties introduce, and introduce the main current requirements elicitation approaches used for the domain. Our research so far revealed that there are very limited approaches that are especially tailored for such domain. Hence we propose in this paper the use of crowdsourcing, which means exploiting the power of the crowd in performing tasks, as a new approach for eliciting requirements of eLS, the paper presents a framework of the necessary elements needed under the umbrella of this new approach to fill in the identified current research gap in the domain.","","978-1-5090-2863-4","10.1109/ICENCO.2016.7856459","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7856459","Requirements engineering;RE;requirements elicitation;electronic learning;eLearning","Stakeholders;Software;Crowdsourcing;Electronic learning;Portals","","4","","42","IEEE","16 Feb 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A new formulation is proposed under the assumption of an optimal student, where optimality is defined in the usual machine learning sense of empirical risk minimization. This is a sensible assumption for machine learning students and for human students in crowdsourcing platforms, who tend to perform at least as well as machine learning systems. It is shown that, if allowed unbounded effort, the optimal student always learns the optimal predictor for a classification task. Hence, the role of the optimal teacher is to select the teaching set that minimizes student effort. This is formulated as a problem of functional optimization where, at each teaching iteration, the teacher seeks to align the steepest descent directions of the risk of (1) the teaching set and (2) entire example population. The optimal teacher, denoted MaxGrad, is then shown to maximize the gradient of the risk on the set of new examples selected per iteration. MaxGrad teaching algorithms are finally provided for both binary and multiclass tasks, and shown to have some similarities with boosting algorithms. Experimental evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of MaxGrad, which outperforms previous algorithms on the classification task, for both machine learning and human students from MTurk, by a substantial margin.","2575-7075","978-1-6654-4509-2","10.1109/CVPR46437.2021.00144","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9577293","","Training;Machine learning algorithms;Education;Sociology;Classification algorithms;Pattern recognition;Risk management","","4","","52","IEEE","2 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It is important to design an effective incentive strategy to attract enough users' participation to guarantee the success of participatory sensing applications. Most of existing incentive mechanisms lack sufficient evaluation on the feasibility and effectiveness in a practical application scenario. Although some recent studies consider several practical factors in psychology and sociology, and evaluate different incentive strategies in practical experiments, but still fail to consider the time and location dependence of sensing data or the long-term sensing data collection requirements. In this paper, we focus on a new participatory sensing application, namely to recruit users to take time and geo-tagged images of the sky for a long duration to build a large-scale dataset, which is used in the research on outdoor air quality level inference. Three incentive strategies, linear reward, competitive and random red envelope are considered. Furthermore, we explore to combine three incentive strategies in different orders to investigate their effects on long-term data collections and perform practical experiments in three universities for a long duration (6 weeks). A number of sky images are collected, from which we obtain some interesting insights, providing important guidelines for designing diversified incentive strategies for long-term participatory sensing data collections.","","978-1-5386-3349-6","10.1109/BIGCOM.2017.27","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8113042","participatory sensing;crowdsourcing;incentive strategies;data collection","Sensors;Data collection;Air quality;Crowdsourcing;Smart phones;Indexes","","3","","24","IEEE","16 Nov 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We consider multiple parameters such as the nature of the activities to be labeled, and the annotation tool, to quantify the annotation quality and time needed. 15 participants were tasked to annotate a total of 40 minutes of data from two publicly available benchmark datasets for inertial activity recognition, being simultaneously displayed both video and accelerometer data during annotation. We compare the resulting labels with the ground truth provided by the original dataset authors. Our participants annotated the data using two representative tools. Metrics like F1-Score and Cohen’s Kappa showed experience did not ensure better labels. While experts were more accurate on the complex Wetlab dataset (51% vs 46%), Novices had 96% F1 on the simple WEAR dataset versus 92% for experts. Comparable Kappa scores (0.96 and 0.94 for WEAR, 0.53 and 0.59 for Wetlab) indicated similar quality for both groups, revealing differences in dataset complexity. Furthermore, experts annotated faster regardless of the tool.

Detecting these accessibility problems using embedded cameras is a plausible remedy. However, current computer vision algorithms for object detection rely on exhaustive search with high-dimensional features that present a heavy computational burden and incur a long latency, making them non-ideal for real-time object detection on embedded platforms. To address this problem, inspired by prior-based searching schemes from human vision, we accelerate the machine vision process by using scene-specific features to select candidate regions in the view for further processing. Our system, {\hav} achieves speedup by trading off the workload from on-line detection to off-line prior data collection and extraction. We demonstrate a complete, scalable PreSight prototype to accelerate general computer vision object detection algorithms with focus on detecting of sidewalk accessibility problems. Our prototype system automates the process of creating a geo- tagged database of object-specific priors using crowdsourcing and utilizes this prior knowledge to speedup object detection on embedded platforms. Evaluating under two benchmark object detection algorithms, we demonstrate that the detection latency can be reduced by around 8 times with the aid of PreSight.","2155-5494","978-1-5090-6599-8","10.1109/SAHCN.2017.7964930","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7964930","","Image color analysis;Object detection;Real-time systems;Acceleration;Computer vision;Feature extraction;Databases","","3","","27","IEEE","3 Jul 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The first objective is achieved with the help of Lloyd's algorithm to divide the enforcement area into a set of uniformly sized coverage regions.

Electronic dictionaries are an important form of data frequently stored in XML format that frequently have errors introduced through a mixture of manual typographical entry errors and optical character recognition errors. In this paper we describe methods for flagging statistical anomalies as likely errors in electronic dictionaries stored in XML format. We describe six systems based on different sources of information. The systems detect errors using various signals in the data including uncommon characters, text length, character-based language models, word-based language models, tied-field length ratios, and tied-field transliteration models. Four of the systems detect errors based on expectations automatically inferred from content within elements of a single field type. We call these single-field systems. Two of the systems detect errors based on correspondence expectations automatically inferred from content within elements of multiple related field types. We call these tied-field systems. For each system, we provide an intuitive analysis of the type of error that it is successful at detecting. Finally, we describe two larger-scale evaluations using crowdsourcing with Amazon's Mechanical Turk platform and using the annotations of a domain expert. The evaluations consistently show that the systems are useful for improving the efficiency with which errors in XML electronic dictionaries can be detected.","","978-1-5090-0662-5","10.1109/ICSC.2016.38","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7439308","","Dictionaries;XML;Cleaning;Optical character recognition software;Data models;Standards;Context","","3","","21","IEEE","24 Mar 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This information extraction (IE) process is complex, thus slow and typically involving human tasks. We propose a hybrid (Human-Machine) information extraction model that efficiently uses resources of different cost (machines, volunteers and/or experts) and speeds up the biocollections' digitization process, while striving to maintain the same quality as human-only IE processes. In the proposed model, called SELFIE, self-aware IE processes determine whether their output quality is satisfactory. If the quality is unsatisfactory, additional or alternative processes that yield higher quality output at higher cost are triggered. The effectiveness of this model is demonstrated by three SELFIE workflows for the extraction of Darwin-core terms from specimens' images. Compared to the traditional human-driven IE approach, SELFIE workflows showed, on average, a reduction of 27% in the information-capture time and a decrease of 32% in the required number of humans and their associated cost, while the quality of the results was negligibly reduced by 0.27%.","","978-1-5386-2686-3","10.1109/eScience.2017.19","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8109124","information extraction;self-awareness;digitization;human-machine;biocollections","Information retrieval;Imaging;Optical character recognition software;Data mining;Computational modeling;Biological system modeling","","3","","39","IEEE","16 Nov 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, understanding this provenance can be difficult. First, making sense of the reasoning in intermediate steps is time-consuming. Especially in distributed sensemaking, the provenance is less cohesive because each analyst only sees a small portion of the data without an understanding of the overall collaboration workflow. Second, analysis errors from one step can propagate to later steps. Furthermore, in exploratory sensemaking, it is difficult to define what an error is since there are no correct answers to reference. In this paper, we explore provenance analysis for distributed sense-making in the context of crowdsourcing, where distributed analysis contributions are captured in microtasks. We propose crowd auditing as a way to help individual analysts visualize and trace provenance to debug distributed sensemaking.

The aim of this study is to evaluate how the preference of one image over another one is related with the knowledge of the participant in photography. In previous work the two discriminant evaluation concepts “presence of a main subject” and “exposure” were found to distinguish group participants with different degrees of knowledge in photography. Each of these groups provided different means of aesthetic appeal ratings when asked to rate on an absolute category scale. The present paper extends previous work by studying preference ratings on a set of image pairs as a function of technical knowledge and more specifically adding a focus on the variance of rating and agreement between participants. The conducted study was composed of two different steps where the participants had to first report their preference of one image over another (paired comparison), and an evaluation of the technical background of the participant using a specific set of images. Based on preference-rating patterns groups of participants were identified. These groups were formed by clustering the participants who saw and shared the same preference rating on images in one group, and the participants with low agreement with other participants in another group. A per-group analysis showed that a high agreement between participants could be observed when participants have technical knowledge. This indicates that higher consistency between participants can be reached when expert users are being recruited, and therefore participants should be carefully selected in image aesthetic appeal evaluation to ensure stable results.","","978-1-5090-0354-9","10.1109/QoMEX.2016.7498934","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7498934","","Photography;Media;Crowdsourcing;Context;Observers;Context modeling;Art","","3","","12","IEEE","27 Jun 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Its main advantages compared with traditional dedicated monitoring architecture includes enhanced coverage, effectiveness and lower costs. However, how to optimally assign mobile users to monitor the channel usage has not been studied in the crowdsourced setting. The main challenges are: the large number of channels to monitor while mobile users may not be available all the time, the need to consider monitoring costs and incentives, as well as the uncertainty of each channel's traffic patterns. In this paper, we tackle such challenges by formulating a stochastic optimization problem that optimizes the spectrum monitoring task for crowdsourced mobile users. We consider the availability pattern of the mobile users and we assume they are given payments as incentives for participating in monitoring. Simulations show that our method outperforms the risk-averse scenario and has a small gap with the solution under perfect information.","","978-1-5090-5019-2","10.1109/GLOCOM.2017.8254093","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8254093","","Monitoring;Mobile communication;Stochastic processes;Channel allocation;Channel estimation;Cognitive radio;Uncertainty","","3","","21","IEEE","15 Jan 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Given the ubiquitous nature of the Web, its importance in today's society, and its increasing use in education, it is an urgent need to help children search the Web effectively. In this paper, we present a QS module, denoted CQS, which assists children in finding appropriate query keywords to capture their information needs by (i) analyzing content written for/by children, (ii) examining phrases and other metadata extracted from reputable (children's) websites, and (iii) using a supervised learning approach to rank suggestions that are appealing to children. CQS offers suggestions with vocabulary that can be comprehended by children and with topics of interest to them.

Second language acquisition (SLA) studies have tackled such assessment tasks wherein only a single short vocabulary test result is available to assess a learner; such studies have shown that the text-coverage, i.e., the percentage of words the learner knows in the text, is the key assessment measure. Currently, count-based percentages are used, in which each word in the given text is classified as being known or unknown to the learner, and the words classified as known are then simply counted. When each word is classified, we can also obtain an uncertainty value as to how likely each word is known to the learner. Although such values can be informative for a readability assessment, how to leverage these values to guarantee their use as an assessment measure that is comparable to that of the previous values remains unclear. We propose a novel framework that allows assessment methods to be uncertainty-aware while guaranteeing comparability to the text-coverage threshold. Such methods involve a computationally complex problem, for which we also propose a practical algorithm. In addition, we propose a neural-network based classifier from which we can obtain better uncertainty values. For evaluation, we created a crowdsourcing-based dataset in which a learner takes both vocabulary and readability tests. The best method under our framework outperformed conventional methods.","","978-1-7281-4550-1","10.1109/ICMLA.2019.00307","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8999180","Uncertainty;Vocabulary Testing;Natural Language Processing","Vocabulary;Uncertainty;Task analysis;Random variables;Crowdsourcing;Syntactics;Indexes","","3","","20","IEEE","17 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The performance of a recommender is typically evaluated in terms of prediction accuracy; a recommender is considered to be better if a larger number of its recommended items are purchased. However, accurate prediction is not enough for increasing user actions. The items might have been purchased even without recommendations, that is, the purchases are not triggered by the recommendations. Conversely, a user might be reluctant to purchase any items and a mere recommendation alone cannot motivate the user to purchase an item even if the recommended item is the best among all the items. In this work, we pursue recommender systems for triggering user actions. For this purpose, we tackle two issues: 1) uplift optimization and 2) persuasive explanation. For the first issue, we propose uplift-based evaluation and optimization methods for recommenders. Uplift, which is defined as an increase in user actions caused by recommendations, cannot be observed directly. We apply a causal inference framework to estimate the average uplift for the offline evaluation of recommenders. For optimization, we derive positive and negative samples specific to uplift and construct pointwise and pairwise optimization methods. Through experiments with three public datasets, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our optimization methods in improving uplift. For the second issue, we propose a new explanation style using context. The context style explanation presents contexts suitable for consuming the recommended items. The exhibited contexts make users imagine situations of items' usage and motivate them to purchase the items. Via a crowdsourcing-based user study, we confirm that the persuasiveness of our explanation style is better than conventional styles. The hybridization of context style with other styles further improves the persuasiveness.","2375-9259","978-1-7281-4896-0","10.1109/ICDMW.2019.00155","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8955640","recommendation effect, causal inference, uplift modeling, explainable recommendation, context-awareness","Recommender systems;Optimization methods;Predictive models;Measurement;Training;Protocols","","3","","48","IEEE","13 Jan 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These platforms aim to incentivize heterogeneous workers to exert effort finishing the tasks and truthfully report their solutions. When the verification for the workers' solutions is absent, the crowdsourcing problem is challenging and is known as information elicitation without verification (IEWV). Majority voting is a common approach to solve an IEWV problem, where a worker is rewarded based on whether his solution is consistent with the majority. However, most prior related work relies on a strong assumption that workers' solution accuracy levels are public knowledge. We relax such an assumption and propose an online learning mechanism based on majority voting, which allows the platform to learn the distribution of the workers' solution accuracy levels. In the mechanism, workers will be asked to report their private accuracy levels (which do not need to be the true values), in addition to deciding their effort levels and solution reporting strategies. The mechanism computes the workers' rewards based on their reported accuracy levels, and the workers obtain rewards if their reported solutions match the majority. We show that our mechanism induces workers to truthfully report their solution accuracy levels in the long run, in which the platform asymptotically achieves zero regret. Moreover, we show that our online mechanism converges faster when the workers are more capable of solving the tasks.","","978-3-903176-29-4","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9155265","","Task analysis;Learning systems;Electronic mail;Crowdsourcing;Labeling;Robots;Real-time systems","","3","","17","","4 Aug 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Therefore, the paradigm of information-driven distributed sensing (IDDS) is essential to achieve efficient inference, where the resources are spent only on sensing and communicating valuable information. In this paper, we consider the problem of IDDS for efficient Bayesian inference with exponential family distributions. We first propose a centralized algorithm (C-IDDS) where a centralized controller exists to make sensing decisions for the sensing agents. As the centralized algorithm does not scale well in large systems, we continue to design a distributed algorithm (D-IDDS) where each individual sensing agents can make their own sensing decisions independently. Both C-IDDS and D-IDDS are online algorithms which can adapt to stochastic system conditions without any future information. Through rigorous theoretical analysis, we prove that the proposed algorithms can achieve an asymptotically optimal system-wide utility. A real testbed has been built to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithms in real-world environments. Using the data from the real-world testbed and comparing with some baseline methods, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed C-IDDS and D-IDDS algorithms.","2155-5494","978-1-5386-4281-8","10.1109/SAHCN.2018.8397111","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8397111","","Sensors;Inference algorithms;Energy consumption;Bayes methods;Task analysis;Internet of Things;Scheduling","","3","","24","IEEE","28 Jun 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, when using crowdsourced fingerprints to construct an indoor radio map, the following challenges should be first addressed: inaccurate location information, nonuniform spatial density, fingerprint dimension diversity and collection device diversity. In this paper, we propose a radio map construction scheme based on crowdsourced fingerprint splitting and fitting to deal with the first three challenges. Our objective is to construct a grid radio map from crowdsourced fingerprints. We propose to split a crowdsourced fingerprint into several neighboring grid cells with some probability. For each grid cell, we propose to first filter out some unimportant features when composing a grid cell fingerprint. Furthermore, for a grid cell with very few or non supporting crowdsourced fingerprints, we propose to construct its fingerprint by using the surface fitting technique. We conduct field measurements and experiments to examine the localization performance. Results show that the proposed scheme can achieve 1.48m mean localization error and is more robustness to location annotation errors.","1558-2612","978-1-5090-4183-1","10.1109/WCNC.2017.7925655","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7925655","","Crowdsourcing;Indoor environments;Trajectory;Indoor radio communication;Manuals;Mobile handsets;Time measurement","","3","","18","IEEE","11 May 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In the past fifteen years, each department of Chinese government has established its own information service system to provide public services to people. However, these systems are isolated from each other and the services they have provided are not well organized. To tackle this problem, this paper proposes a novel platform for the service management and application development in smart cities. Based on this platform, different people can collaborate and make their contributions, such as requirement acquisition and service development. First, we gather all information and services from existing system to the platform. Second, the platform can publish application or service development requirements based on the crowdsourcing paradigm. Third, small-to-medium service vendors and developers could undertake these development tasks and make use of services provided by our open platform to develop innovative applications. Finally, it provides human-centered services to citizens in appropriate channels when necessary. In this paper, we present the architecture design of the platform and key technologies to implement it. Besides, two practice cases in smart cities of China are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the platform.","2329-6313","978-1-4799-5206-9","10.1109/ICGSEW.2014.15","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6912086","Smart city;human-centered services;integrated service platform;service supermarket","Cities and towns;Government;Software;Educational institutions;Crowdsourcing;Information services","","3","","10","IEEE","29 Sep 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Recent research has explored more nuanced ways to perform emotion analysis. Unsupervised emotion analysis methods require a critical resource: a lexicon that is appropriate for the task at hand, in terms of the emotional range and diversity captured. Emotion analysis lexicons are created manually by domain experts and usually assign one single emotion to each word. We propose an automated workflow for creating and evaluating a multi-valued emotion lexicon created and evaluated through crowdsourcing. We compare the obtained lexicon with established lexicons and appoint expert English Linguists to assess crowd peer-evaluations.

In this context, a central challenge in delivering trustworthy parking services is to ensure a truthful behavior of the involved (possibly unreliable) users. Towards this direction, we present two rewarding schemes that provably incentivize users to behave truthfully.

With the recent advances of Internet of Things (IoTs), cloud computing, and 5G network, MCS has drawn great attention in recent years. Worker selection is one of the most fundamental problems in MCS, as the selected workers’ qualifications play a significant role in the service quality. In this paper, by extending the research scope of previous literature, we formulate a novel worker selection problem in MCS that incorporates spatial-temporal constraints over workers’ tentative future trajectories. Specifically, each worker is required to submit a tentative future trajectory in advance and the MCS platform only selects qualified workers who meet both the spatial and temporal constraints. To increase the efficiency of worker selection, we propose a hybrid indexing approach to efficiently index workers’ spatial-temporal information by combining MX-CIF quadtree and Interval tree. Besides, we design a greedy algorithm, which considers both the reliability of the selected workers and the overall budget at the same time. Furthermore, to protect workers’ sensitive spatial-temporal information from being disclosed to untrusted parties, we design a privacy-preserving technique by transferring workers’ real spatial-temporal information to the approximate data with restricted information. Security analysis shows that the proposed solution is privacy-preserving. Extensive experiments are conducted, and the results demonstrate that our scheme outperforms the baseline methods.","","978-1-6654-7398-9","10.1109/PST55820.2022.9851973","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9851973","spatial-temporal constraint;mobile crowdsensing;worker selection","Greedy algorithms;Roads;Reliability engineering;Real-time systems;Trajectory;Sensors;Security","","2","","20","IEEE","18 Aug 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Non-government organizations and local government units are faced with having to identify, assess, and monitor rapidly growing migrant communities in order to provide urgent humanitarian aid. However, with many of these displaced populations living in informal settlements areas across the country, locating migrant settlements over large territories can be a major challenge. To address this problem, we propose a novel approach for rapidly and cost-effectively locating new and emerging informal settlements using machine learning and publicly accessible Sentinel-2 time series satellite imagery. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach in identifying potential Venezuelan migrant settlements that have emerged between 2015 and 2020 in Colombia. Finally, we emphasize the importance of post-classification verification and present a two-step validation approach consisting of (1) remote validation using Google Earth and (2) on-the-ground validation through the Premise App, a mobile crowdsourcing platform.","","978-1-7281-7031-2","10.1109/AI4G50087.2020.9311041","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9311041","poverty mapping;informal settlements;remote sensing;machine learning","Time series analysis;Satellites;Indexes;Earth;Vegetation mapping;Computational modeling;Sociology","","2","","20","IEEE","12 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"Synthetization of bicycle route data from aggregate GPS-based cycling data and its utility for bicycle route choice analysis","S.

This disaggregate data, which provides information on revealed preference of cyclists choosing their routes through a city road network, is often used to analyze bicycle route choice. However, the required data is usually not available for most city areas. In recebt years, more and more commercial companies and nongovernmental initiatives provide aggregate GPS-based cycling data. Due to crowdsourcing, the data is relatively cheap to acquire and available for most cities around the globe (e.g. data from Strava). However, the data do not provide detailed information on single routes because companies usually process the data and provide aggregate data instead of single route data. Thus, the data do not meet the requirements for detailed analysis. Few studies investigated how to exploit the aggregate data or even how to derive single routes. Disaggregating the available aggregate data to synthetic single routes could help to generate detailed cycling route data on low costs. However, there is currently no knowledge about feasibility of route disaggregation and the validity of resulting routes. Therefore, the article presents results of the evaluation of a developed route synthetization approach. To evaluate the approach, a large bicycle GPS data sample is aggregated first. This ensures that the used aggregate data possess the same data structure as the data provided e.g. by commercial providers. In a second step, detailed routes are synthesized using a state-of-research multistep route synthetization approach. The comparison of synthesized routes with the original ones reveals an impressive match (up to 97%). However, accuracy strongly depends on zonal size of the aggregate input data.","","978-1-7281-8995-6","10.1109/MT-ITS49943.2021.9529316","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9529316","GPS data;synthetization;bicycle route choice;aggregate data","Crowdsourcing;Roads;Urban areas;Bicycles;Companies;Data aggregation;Data structures","","2","","29","IEEE","7 Sep 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It provides numerous applications, varying from detecting potholes to monitoring pollution levels and temperature in a given area. However, a major challenge that MCS faces is the high cost of sensing which includes incentive costs for participants and energy costs for computation. Thus, a new paradigm of sparse mobile crowdsensing has been introduced where only a small number of values are sensed, and the rest of the values are inferred using an inference algorithm. Recent research indicates that the accuracy of the inferred values depends on the inference algorithm as well as the subset of cells selected by the MCS platform for sensing. This paper discusses how the shortcomings of traditional MCS led to the discovery of a new research area, sparse MCS. Further, the paper describes the components of an MCS framework and provides a comprehensive review of various state-of-the-art frameworks, together with potential future research areas.","","978-1-6654-8453-4","10.1109/AIIoT54504.2022.9817212","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9817212","Sparse Mobile Crowdsensing (Sparse MCS);Inference Algorithm;Cell Selection;IOT;Compressive Sensing","Temperature sensors;Costs;Pollution;Crowdsensing;Inference algorithms;Mobile handsets;Sensors","","2","","42","IEEE","13 Jul 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

An analysis of physical features is generally used to analyze sound properties; however, human beings not only analyze but also emotionally connect to sounds. If we want to visualize the sounds according to the characteristics of the listener, we need to collect not only the raw sound, but also the subjective feelings associated with them. For this purpose, we developed a sound collection system using a crowdsourcing approach to collect physical sounds, their statistics, and subjective evaluations simultaneously. We then conducted a sound collection experiment using the developed system on ten participants. We collected 6,257 samples of equivalent loudness levels and their locations, and 516 samples of sounds and their locations. Subjective evaluations by the participants are also included in the data. Next, we tried to visualize the sound on a map. The loudness levels are visualized as a color map and the sounds are visualized as icons which indicate the sound type. Finally, we conducted a discrimination experiment on the sound to implement a function of automatic conversion from sounds to appropriate icons. The classifier is trained on the basis of the GMM-UBM (Gaussian Mixture Model and Universal Background Model) method.

Therefore, it is important to design systems which perform reliably even in the presence of such unreliable components. Coding theory based techniques provide a possible solution to this problem. In this position paper, we survey some of our recent work on the use of coding theory based techniques for the design of some signal processing applications.

Information collected through conventional sources (e.g., incident reports, 911 calls, physical volunteers, etc.) are proving to be insufficient [1]. Responsible organizations are now leaning towards research grounds that explore digital human connectivity and freely available sources of information. U.S. Geological Survey and Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) introduced Critical Lifeline (CLL) s which identifies the most significant areas that require immediate attention in case of natural disasters. These organizations applied crowdsourcing by connecting digital volunteer networks to collect data on the critical lifelines from data sources including social media [3], [4], [5]. In the past couple of years, during some of the deadly hurricanes (e.g., Harvey, IRMA, Maria, Michael, Florence, etc.), people took on different social media platforms like never seen before, in search of help for rescue, shelter, and relief. Their posts reflect crisis updates and their real-time observations on the devastation that they witness. In this paper, we propose a methodology to build and analyze time-frequency features of words on social media to assist the volunteer networks in identifying the context before, during and after a natural disaster and distinguishing contexts connected to the critical lifelines. We employ Continuous Wavelet Transform to help create word features and propose two ways to reduce the dimensions which we use to create word clusters to identify themes of conversations associated with stages of a disaster and these lifelines. We compare two different methodologies of wavelet features and word clusters both qualitatively and quantitatively, to show that wavelet features can identify and separate context without using semantic information as inputs.","","978-1-7281-1689-1","10.1109/SMARTCOMP.2019.00072","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8783996","Hurricanes;Disaster response;Social media;Wavelet analysis;Clustering","Hurricanes;Continuous wavelet transforms;Twitter;Feature extraction","","2","","23","IEEE","1 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Although the spatial locality of the collected geospatial terms can only be temporary, such time variability difference among the geospatial terms have not been considered in the existing work. Thus, in order to separately collect the stationary and temporary geospatial terms with proper timing, we propose an on-line method for constructing a geographical dictionary containing the up-to-date geospatial terms and their locations by continuously examining the spatial locality of terms in streaming geotagged posts. The geospatial terms can be distinguished between stationary and temporary terms according to their usage patterns in the recent set of geotagged posts and their locations recorded in the geographical dictionary.

However, using all features in these sets may delay the decision. Since we are interested in reaching an accurate decision in a timely manner, an optimal way of selecting features from multiple feature sets is needed. To this end, we propose a novel approach that sequentially reviews available features and feature sets to decide whether the feature review process must continue in the current set or move to the next one. In the end, when all feature sets have been reviewed, the issue is classified using all available information. It is shown that the proposed approach is guaranteed to review the least number of features in all feature sets before reaching a decision, while the optimum decision rule is shown to minimize the average Bayes risk.

In this specific context, we prove the equivalence of well-studied criteria of active learning like entropy minimization and expected error reduction. Interestingly, we observe that we can decouple the problems of identifying an optimal unlabeled instance and identifying an annotator to label it. We observe a useful connection between the multi-armed bandit framework and the annotator selection in active learning. Due to the nature of the distribution of the rewards on the arms, we use the Robust Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) scheme with truncated empirical mean estimator to solve the annotator selection problem.

The development of convergence of computing and telecommunication which have been shown in the evolution of WAN, GSM, 2G, 3G, WiMAX, LTE, 4G up to 5 are triggered by worldwide competition and collaboration among researchers and engineers from all over the world. Open source software, operating systems and network simulators have been used in many ways in improving the Internet Protocol. The trend is going towards big data mining based on wireless sensor networks and crowdsourcing based information. At the University of Indonesia, we have used NS-2 and NS-3 as the de facto open source network simulator. In 2018, our work on the LoRaWAN, NB-IoT and Blockchain are based on NS-3. We have trained the next information infrastructure engineers using open source simulator. Meanwhile, cellular communications are evolving toward the fifth generation (5G). For testing the 5G network, we use The OpenAirInterface as the experimental platform to teach and to learn mobile communication networks. In delivering networking course at the UI, a comprehensive case study experience has led to a significant enhancement in teaching process, capability of students to master networking skills. The use of open source tools is more flexible, cheaper and available to be used for protocol engineering. We review the phases of installation, contributed code development, testing, and functions of 5G technology using the OpenAirInterface and NS-3. We present the result of the comparison of those tools.","","978-1-7281-3461-1","10.1109/ICEED47294.2019.8994943","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8994943","Network simulator;LoRaWAN;5G;OAI;Infrastructure Information Engineer","","","2","","29","IEEE","13 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"Finding potential influences of a specific financial market in Twitter","N. Kanungsukkasem; T.

In this paper, we start by mainly focusing on the first step of our framework, selecting potential influencers based on their association with a particular stock market. With numerous limitations of Twitter service to access and acquire Twitters data, a new methodology is also proposed to use a List feature to select potential financial influencers. It requires only Lists of accounts that contain an official Twitter account of the specific financial market, provided by Twitter's users, through Twitter API. Our methodology is designed to use only a small amount of data, by which it can be practically used under the limitation of Twitter API's crawling rate. Experimental results show that most of the potential influencers returned by our methodology are similar and related to the specific financial markets, which are companies listed on S&P 500 in this experiment. Most of the returned influencers are the official accounts of company or organization from the same sector and news media with a special emphasis on the same industry. Comparing to Twitter's user recommendation service (Who-To-Follow) and a crowdsourcing search for topic experts (Cognos), our methodology returns more related accounts in both percentage and the number.","","978-1-4673-7863-5","10.1109/ICITEED.2015.7408982","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7408982","","Twitter;Companies;Stock markets;Correlation;Information technology;Electric potential;Crowdsourcing","","2","","24","IEEE","18 Feb 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To date we have collected videos for and against Antifa and other anti-Fascist groups, Black Lives Matter, Proud Boys, Oath Keepers and QAnon and manually labelled subsets for style, stance toward the group, persuasiveness, techniques used and other features. We have also extracted video features including titles, descriptions, time of upload, captions and ASR transcripts, topic categories, and users’ likes, dislikes, comments, and views. We are currently using these to automatically identify information such as the stance of the video (for or against a group), changes in popularity and in the sentiment of viewers toward the videos over time, correlating these changes with major events. We are also extracting text and audio features from videos and their comments to develop multimodal Machine Learning models for use in identifying different types of videos (e.g. pro- and anti- a group, extremely popular or unpopular) and eventually to use in identifying new radical groups and tracking their success. We will also be crowdsourcing surveys of subsets of these videos to understand how persons with different demographics and personality types perceive and are potentially influenced by different groups and different types of videos.","","978-1-6654-3902-2","10.1109/BigData52589.2021.9671635","Air Force Office of Scientific Research; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9671635","radicalization;videos;far-right groups;far-left groups;popularity","Support vector machines;Crowdsourcing;Visualization;Social networking (online);Multimedia Web sites;Machine learning;Big Data","","2","","21","IEEE","13 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, due to heterogeneous features of MUs and dynamic of wireless channel state, this have a significant effect on the global model performance and the training efficiency, where the MU scheduling problem becomes crucial. In this paper, we focus on unknown MU scheduling problem for mobile crowdsourcing system in wireless network to enable FL, where MUs' quality of local model knowledge are unknown a priori. Our objective is to find a scheduling strategy from the perpective of maximizing MUs' quality of local model and improving the FL communication efficiency. We model MU scheduling problem as an integrated Combinatorial Multi-Armed Bandit (CMAB) program taking into account reputation mechanism, and then propose a discounted-UCB and reputation-based scheduling algorithm to balance between exploration and exploitation, as well as to reduce the FL communication latency. Moreover, we validate the superiority of the proposed scheduling algorithm via experiments conducted on an image classification task. The results show that the proposed scheduling algorithm can well promote the convergence performance of federated learning and save the training latency, compared with the state-of-the-art scheduling strategy.","","978-1-6654-5085-0","10.1109/WCSP55476.2022.10039253","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2020YFB2104004); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62071252,62201285); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10039253","federated learning;client scheduling;multi-armed bandit (MAB);reputation mechanism;high-quality model","Training;Knowledge engineering;Scheduling algorithms;Crowdsensing;Wireless networks;Signal processing;Dynamic scheduling","","2","","14","IEEE","15 Feb 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
