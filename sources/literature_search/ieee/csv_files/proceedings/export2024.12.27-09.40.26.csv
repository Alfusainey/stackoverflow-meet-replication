Our framework uses two machine learning algorithms, namely XGBoost and Neural Network, to estimate the received energy. The result shows that the Neural Network model is better than XGBoost at predicting the received energy.

After the processing of the measurements, the estimated spatial field of signal strength is updated. We use a propagation model of the signal that includes an unknown path loss exponent. Furthermore, our model takes into account the inaccurate locations of the reporting users. In this paper, we employ a Bayesian approach for crowdsourcing that is based on Gaussian Processes.

This paper discusses the interpretation of the signal strength indicators measured by mobile phones in LTE networks when connected to the base station and explains how the instantaneous or maximum exposure is related to them. Longterm measurements of a smartphone and a field strength meter are presented in comparison, which show the time-dependent variation of the utilization of the radio cell during the day. In addition, it is demonstrated how the measurement data of the smartphone have to be adjusted due to the measurement characteristics resulting from the considered signal components in order to correspond correctly with the exposure.

Despite the huge investment in HIS in the Namibian health sector, the challenge of interoperability remains a problem due to the fact that the silo HIS in the Namibian health environment are not integrated in order to exchange and communicate disease surveillance data with each other. The challenge is the HIS are heterogeneous systems with unstructured data, different data formats, developed by different vendors and are running on different software. One source of disease surveillance data is provided by communities in a phenomenon normally referred to as crowdsourcing. As a result, the objective of this study was to develop a prototype that allows crowdsource users to utilise their mobile devices to access, exchange and communicate disease surveillance data in real time directly to the District Health Information Systems (DHIS-2) in regional offices and the national office of the Ministry of Health and Social Services (MoHSS) in Namibia for semantic interoperability. The current method used for communicating disease surveillance information between the MoHSS, and its agency, the Centre for Disease Control (CDC) and public health institutions is a manual system which is not appropriate as it causes delays in the exchange of information among them.

However, they mostly compared games or genres with each other and neglected the fact even two levels of the same game may have different sensitivity toward delay. In order to understand the game characteristics that cause this difference in delay sensitivity, a bottom-up approach by means of modifiable open source games can be of high value. In this paper we present a game designed to tackle this issue. The game allows to artificially change characteristics of the game, such as the pace and size of objects, and also simulate influences like delay, packet loss or a reduced frame rate.

The applicability of IoT to the entire process of hazard identification has not been fully harnessed. This paper conceptualized a smart IoT architecture for air quality monitoring and hazard identification. Notably, a data governance layer is part of the proposed cloud centric database architecture, to tackle the concerns about data governance. For the architecture, JavaScript Object Notation was adopted as a standard for data exchange to enable interoperability among components from different service providers and device manufacturers. As a proof of concept, an IoT node for air quality monitoring was prototyped. A web application with crowdsourcing capability was developed to provide a platform through which users can report and be notified of hazardous incidents. The results obtained during the testing phases of the two architectural components developed herein shows that the proposed architecture is characterized with adequate interoperability.

We can improve the quality of work, and also we can decrease time and wages if we eliminate poor workers and give extra instruction to their workers. Therefore, estimating work quality is essential for uncovering poor workers. In existing studies, the response behavior of workers was used to estimate their quality. However, in these studies, the authors only apply to complicated tasks that have many types of response behavior. In this paper, we propose a method for estimating the quality of workers by their response behavior by intentionally complicating a simple task. By doing so, we can get more accurate and detailed response behavior. By using accurate and detailed response behavior even in simple tasks that have few types of response behavior, the estimation accuracy of low-quality workers improved. However, workers had to work for slightly longer.","","978-1-5386-2715-0","10.1109/BigData.2017.8258476","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8258476","crowdsourcing;quality;behavior;task complication","Redundancy;Estimation;Crowdsourcing;Mice;Web pages;Support vector machines","","2","","14","IEEE","15 Jan 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

With these systems, it is easy to collect multiple noisy labels for the same object when conducting annotation for supervised learning. Because non-expert labelers lack expertise and dedication, and have strong personal preference, they may have bias when labeling. These cause Imbalanced Multiple Noisy Labeling. In this paper, we propose an agnostic algorithm Positive LAbel frequency Threshold (PLAT) to deal with imbalanced labeling. Because of the dynamics of social networks, in most cases no information about the qualities of labelers and underlying class distributions can be acquired. PLAT does not require prior knowledge of the labeling qualities of labelers, the underlying class distributions, and the level of labeling imbalance. Simulations on eight real-world datasets with different underlying class distributions demonstrate that PLAT not only effectively deals with the imbalanced multiple noisy labeling that off-the-shelf agnostic methods cannot cope with, but also performs nearly the same as majority voting under the circumstances that labelers have no bias.","","978-1-4503-2240-9","10.1145/2492517.2492640","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6785688","crowdsourcing;outsourcing;classification;multiple noisy labels;imbalance labeling","Labeling;Noise measurement;Accuracy;Conferences;Training;Social network services;Data mining","","2","","16","","10 Apr 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Four reference types were examined in the experiment; Correct, Random, Machine prediction trained by correct answers, and that trained by human answers. Learning effects were observed only in presenting machine prediction, although those accuracy rates were far from correct (100%). Moreover, there were no learning effects in ""Correct"" and ""Random"". This suggests the following hypothesis: Since machine learners make some ""models"" for the problem, it is easier for humans to interpret the outputs of machine learners than the results without via them; it is more difficult to interpret not only random answers but also the correct answers in a case where the perfect interpretation of the problem is difficult. Furthermore, some workers answered with higher accuracy rate than machines in the post-test.

A flood occurs when the overflow of water that melts relatively dry land. In the hydrology discipline, floods are a field of study and they are the most common and widespread unpredictable weather occurrence of natural sources. Floods can look quite different because anywhere from a few inches of water to several feet is affected by flooding. They can also come on suddenly, or slowly increase. Therefore frequent identification of flood impact levels is very important. This study aims to create a multimedia big data platform with a deep learning approach for flood emergency management. It uses multimedia data as they are freely available as social media data (Twitter and Facebook), satellite image data, crowdsourcing, and sensor network data for mining purposes. As this research based on deep learning and image processing cutting edge technologies, authorities can identify impact level using satellite images and provide a real-time warning for the people or people can use this for self-estimation of flood risk level when they want in their day to day life like detecting passable or low-risk roads in flooding time. The deep neural network plays a major role in feature extraction and data augmentation helps to increase the number of images in the dataset. This study provides a comparative study between VGG16, VGG19, Densetnet169, and MobileNet deep learning models and evaluates the performance by using training and testing data. Dataset compromises of over 1500 data and the conclusions drawn from work prove that the MobileNet model worked with 86% accuracy with high performance.

Estimating the abundance, movement, and survival of brook trout in the wild is an important task for environmental management, and current methods often involve physical tagging or collection of DNA samples for each of the fish as their unique identifier. However, this process is expensive and inefficient. Meanwhile, although deep learning methods have proven effective for individual recognition of humans, it remains challenging to apply this system to wildlife biology due to fewer available images, different biometric patterns, and relatively poor image quality. In this paper, we develop a framework to automate the process of individual recognition of brook trout. Distinguished from simply adopting traditional feature descriptors (e.g., SIFT and HOG) or using deep neural networks on the raw images, our framework utilizes multiple modalities consisting of the region of interest and gray-scaled pigmentation patterns. We use these multiple modality features in a Convolutional Neural network to generate feature vectors as fish descriptors. These descriptors are then used to distinguish individual brook trout by ranking their relative distance in latent space. Our experimental framework demonstrates better results than baseline methods such as SIFT and HOG while being more robust to distortions characteristic of large imagery datasets collected through crowdsourcing and citizen science.","","978-1-6654-8045-1","10.1109/BigData55660.2022.10020966","U.S. Geological Survey; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10020966","biometrics;aquaculture;deep learning;individual recognition;ecology","Deep learning;Visualization;Biometrics (access control);Computational modeling;Wildlife;Big Data;Fish","","2","","10","IEEE","26 Jan 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Data sharing with a central server is a common approach of crowdsourcing, but also brings privacy and security concerns. The emerging federated learning offers a promising pathway to achieve an accurate model through distributed machine learning while ensuring data privacy. The existing federated learning process is not tailored to the mobile and adhoc nature of IoT systems where devices are of varying data and system qualities and may not be able to participate the entire training process. Therefore, in this paper, a new federated learning framework is proposed to support asynchronous model fusion with clustering-based participant selection.

Since the amount of tasks are fixed, it is reasonable to assume the cost is constant, and the consumed time becomes an important index. To minimize the cost time, the main challenges lie in how to allocate tasks to complete these tasks in a decentralized way and avoid solving a new optimization problem at each step. The advantages and novelty of our work are threefold: i) Leveraging the consensus and distributed method, we transform the minimum-time problem into a solvable distributed optimization problem. By consensus algorithm, the allocation method is expressed explicitly and easily. ii) We prove that the convergence of assignment process and optimal allocation is achieved geometrically. iii) The proposed algorithm is extended to the case where the efficiencies of agents are stochastic, and simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.","2577-2465","978-1-7281-9484-4","10.1109/VTC2020-Fall49728.2020.9348860","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9348860","","Vehicular and wireless technologies;Maximum likelihood estimation;Transforms;Resource management;Task analysis;Optimization;Convergence","","2","","18","IEEE","15 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For this, we constructed a novel open-source data set consisting of 4000 URI-oriented images of people facing the camera, each augmented by three conversation-starting questions. We compared a baseline retrieval-based model and a generative model.

In this paper, we propose a turn-based correction approach which aims to reduce the potential accumulated errors caused by inaccurate heading estimations during turns. We consider a crowdsourcing environment in which previous users' data can help in the positioning of current users. For previous and current users moving in reverse directions and turn at the same position, we match the previous user's turning position with the current user's using Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence based on the received signal strength (RSS) scans collected. Upon a match, the previous user's pre-turn positions can be used to improve the post-turn positions of the current user. Tests are done for different types of paths and the results show that the proposed approach can effectively reduce the PDR errors caused by inaccurate heading estimations at turning points.","2471-917X","978-1-5386-5635-8","10.1109/IPIN.2018.8533698","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8533698","","","","2","","32","IEEE","15 Nov 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Status quo studies are lacking of efficient distribution especially when user traces and budgets are involved. In achieving efficient and effective mobile advertisement applications, this work advocates the concept of location-centric mobile crowdsourcing network instead of conventional user-centric and platform, where locations are vitally important for advertisement distribution. To this end, this work focuses on the mobile advertisement user selection problem when interested area coverage (IAC) is considered. Unfortunately, developing location-centric needs to deal with the spatio-temporal features in each user, and IAC coverage needs to be effectively counted. Even worse, budget constraint makes this problem intractable. In tackling aforementioned challenges, this work makes following efforts: First, a budget-constrained user selection problem is formulated when location sensitive mobile advertisement applications are considered, which is proved to be NP-hard. Second, the submodularity feature is explored, and a simple but efficient heuristic algorithm is presented with guaranteed approximation ratio (1-1/e). Finally, extensive simulation results show that, our scheme could effectively improve the propagation effects for mobile advertisement with 125%.","","978-1-5090-3677-6","10.1109/CBD.2016.025","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7815191","Mobile advertisement;Interested area coverage;Budget constraint","Mobile communication;Trajectory;Approximation algorithms;Mobile computing;Advertising;Crowdsourcing;Heuristic algorithms","","2","","12","IEEE","16 Jan 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The complex and expensive quality control at the sequencing level, however, has not been able to check a large number of samples effectively. To tackle this problem, this paper proposes a data-driven method for the quantitative assessment of BioBrick's quality. This method only needs the data itself without the requirement for quality labels in advance, and it generates a score for each BioBrick that explains its accuracy under sequence recognition. First, a group of one-vs-rest classifiers is constructed and compared with multiple learning strategies for sequence analysis. The accuracy score is then calculated by leveraging the divergence of these classifiers. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves good performance on BioBricks classification and quality assessment. Furthermore, the range of the most informative subregion of BioBricks narrows down to 1-150 base positions, of which 5 base positions can achieve more than 72.9% accuracy for BioBrick classification. By formulating data-driven quality calculator, this paper highlights the application of machine learning to facilitate BioBrick quality assessment in a more generalized fashion.","","978-1-6654-1540-8","10.1109/ICBAIE52039.2021.9389886","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9389886","BioBrick quality;Machine learning;Sequence recognition","Sequential analysis;Sequences;Data integrity;Machine learning;Synthetic biology;Quality assessment;Standards","","2","","17","IEEE","2 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Therefore, AP locations can be estimated when enough number of location-labeled Wi-Fi fingerprints are obtained. Since manually collecting Wi-Fi fingerprints costs human labor, crowdsourcing approach is preferred. Crowdsourced Wi-Fi fingerprints usually need an additional step to tag a location label. The low accuracy of indirectly acquired location labels affects the result of AP location estimation. Therefore, some AP locations need to be discarded if the error of estimated AP location is high. To measure the error, it is necessary to survey the ground truth of AP location. Since surveying true AP locations also costs human labor, an error prediction method is helpful. We propose the neural network that predicts the error of an estimated AP location.

Crowdsourced testing utilizes testers which subscribe to an external or internal crowdsourcing platform. Usually these testers are distributed across geographies. Thus, such testing can be treated as a form of distributed testing. Crowdsourced testing, quite often, is used to perform exploratory testing in which testers test the features as per their wish. Such testing results in redundant testing efforts due to the lack of awareness of other testers' activities, thus does not yield the full benefits of crowdsourced testing in terms of speed and coverage. Moreover, as each tester possesses a testing style, the present model of crowdsourced testing does not fully utilize tester's strength or style. In this paper, we study various redundancies involved in a distributed testing. We also study testers' behavior to understand various testing styles. The study finds that there exists a lot of redundancies in testing efforts. The study also observes that testers indeed have different testing styles which should be understood more deeply for engaging them better. Our study shows that there is need for tools and strategies for allocating testing tasks that leverages testers' testing style and creates more awareness among the testers.","","978-1-5386-1587-4","10.1109/ICGSE.2017.7","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7976691","Crowdsourcing;software development;Crowdsourced testing","Testing;Redundancy;Software;Measurement;Crowdsourcing;Portals;Organizations","","1","","17","IEEE","17 Jul 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The videos were collected from live videoconferencing calls in 83 different network conditions. We applied QR codes as markers on the source videos to create aligned references and compute temporal features based on the alignment vectors. Using these features together with VMAF core features, our proposed model achieves a PCC of 0.99 on the validation set.

An example of such competition is drivers, guided by their smartphones, attempting to park, they are competing for a limited number of parking spaces. This is an example, but spatio-temporal competition arises in many other transportation applications.

On the other side, along with the growth of crowd sourcing, the issue of information security is proposed as one of the existing challenges. Crowd sourcing can be formed to perform basic and purposeful activities to the same degree that is formed by violating moral principles in social environments and with the aim of doing destructive activities. This platform has several security problems due to lack of suitable information about users' background at the time of membership and how they perform. If crowd sourcing systems are faced with security problems and data privacy, there will be a negative effect on accepting and using this technology.

While consensus exists that no one approach works in all situations, how do practitioners and researchers select the most relevant and appropriate approach(es)? In order to understand this, we argue that a community-based effort is required to organise the plethora of requirements engineering approaches into an ontology.

The approach, however, is not always effective; if the AI does not meet the quality requirement, we may have to give up the development and all the data items have to be done manually. In order to avoid this all-or-nothing situation, “selective” AI programs that perform tasks which they are confident to do will be effective.

In this regard, measuring similarities among scientific documents can help researchers to identify groups with similar interests as a basis for strengthening collaboration and university-industry linkages. To this end, we intend to evaluate the performance of hybrid crowd-computing methods in measuring the similarity between document pairs by comparing the results achieved by crowds and artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms. That said, in this paper we designed two types of experiments to illustrate some issues in calculating how similar an automatic solution is to a given ground truth. In the first type of experiments, we created a crowdsourcing campaign consisting of four human intelligence tasks (HITs) in which the participants had to indicate whether or not a set of papers belonged to the same author. The second type involves a set of natural language processing (NLP) processes in which we used the TF-IDF measure and the Bidirectional Encoder Representation from Transformers (BERT) model. The results of the two types of experiments carried out in this study provide preliminary insight into detecting major contributions from human-AI cooperation at similarity calculation in order to achieve better decision support. We believe that in this case decision makers can be better informed about potential collaborators based on content-based insights enhanced by hybrid human-AI mechanisms.","","978-1-6654-0170-8","10.1109/ICHMS53169.2021.9582633","Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9582633","affinity;BERT model;crowdsourcing;human-AI cooperation;inter-researcher similarity detection;tf-idf","Crowdsourcing;Couplings;Human intelligence;Collaboration;Transformers;Particle measurements;Natural language processing","","1","","16","IEEE","27 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This approach measures the complexity level of every contribution committed contributors (or programmers) from the beginning of the project to date. This will help us to find quality programmers and see when they start improving. We use cyclomatic complexity (CC) to decide the complexity level of a contribution. In practice, we could use this approach to assess the quality of a programmer based on his/her previous contributions.","","978-1-6654-2733-3","10.1109/ICIMCIS53775.2021.9699233","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9699233","cyclomatic complexity;code quality;programmer quality;crowdsourcing project","Measurement;Crowdsourcing;Codes;Multimedia systems;Keyboards;Market research;Complexity theory","","1","","15","IEEE","9 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Current radio-frequency (RF) management technologies using ray-tracing or radio propagation modeling can estimate the radio signal strength in an entire cell area, but these accuracies are insufficient and ray-tracing takes a very long time to calculate. While measurement data at user equipment collected via the cell-trace function at base stations or crowdsourcing schemes are comparatively accurate, they are not included in the entire cell area. Our management framework selects the best of both technologies. We also propose a pilot algorithm for estimating and interpolating key indexes in real-space such as signal strength for quality of experience visualization. The proposed algorithm ensures that the benefits of the current technologies are incorporated.","","978-1-4673-8991-4","10.1109/NETWKS.2016.7751182","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7751182","QoE Visualization;Neural Networks","Radio frequency;Sea measurements;Neural networks;Sea surface;Integrated circuits;Vegetation mapping;Rail transportation","","1","3","12","IEEE","24 Nov 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The notion of participatory sensing, or crowds ensing, is that a large ensemble of voluntary contributors provides measurements, rather than relying on a dedicated sensing infrastructure. The participatory sensing network under consideration in this work is based on GNSS receivers embedded in, for example, mobile phones. The provided measurements refer to the receiver-reported carrier-to-noise-density ratio ($C / N_{0}$) estimates or automatic gain control (AGC) values. In this work, we exploit $C / N_{0}$ measurements to locate a GNSS jammer, using multiple receivers in a crowdsourcing manner. We extend a previous jammer position estimator by only including data that is received during parts of the sensing period where jamming is detected by the sensor. In addition, we perform hardware testing for verification and evaluation of the proposed and compared state-of-the-art algorithms. Evaluations are performed using a Samsung S20+ mobile phone as participatory sensor and a Spirent GSS9000 GNSS simulator to generate GNSS and jamming signals. The proposed algorithm is shown to work well when using $C / N_{0}$ measurements and outperform the alternative algorithms in the evaluated scenarios, producing a median error of 50 meters when the pathloss exponent is 2. With higher pathloss exponents the error gets higher. The AGC output from the phone was too noisy and needs further processing to be useful for position estimation.","2153-3598","978-1-6654-1772-3","10.1109/PLANS53410.2023.10140088","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10140088","GNSS;jamming;localization;participatory sensing;crowdsensing","Global navigation satellite system;Atmospheric measurements;Receivers;Automatic generation control;Particle measurements;Mobile handsets;Sensors","","1","","11","IEEE","8 Jun 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In other words, it contributes decisively to making right and fair decisions. In this respect, this paper aims to showcase a software-based platform that is designed to enhance public participation in the decision-making process, allowing all interested stakeholders and relevant beneficiaries to join decision makers for jointly designing and eventually selecting the most effective combinations of actions, customised to a specific pre-defined problem of energy or socioeconomic nature, using crowdsourcing techniques and methods of modelling, simulating and evaluating options using open data and global system dynamics.","","978-1-6654-2228-4","10.1109/IISA50023.2020.9284362","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9284362","participatory innovation;public participation;participatory platform;optimization;decision-making","System dynamics;Decision making;Sociology;Stakeholders;Sustainable development;Statistics;Testing","","1","","14","IEEE","11 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A decade earlier, the Public Sensing term appeared to utilize a limited network of sensing devices that collect information from the surrounding for a specific purpose. The limited connectivity, heterogeneity of the sensing devices, and the immaturity of technologies hindered the widespread implementation of Public Sensing as a Service (PSaaS) in real-world scenarios. To date, there is no clear definition for Public Sensing, and it is frequently confused with other terms such as mobile crowdsensing and crowdsourcing. In this paper, we redefine Public Sensing in the context of the widespread IoT and propose a new architecture for Public Sensing as a Service. The conclusion of the discussion demonstrates that the proposed PSaaS holds a considerable promise for public adoption and will offer real-time smart services to inform decision-making and improve quality of life.","0742-1303","978-1-6654-8001-7","10.1109/LCN53696.2022.9843516","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9843516","Public Sensing;ThingsDriver;Internet of Things;Collaborative IoT;PSaaS","Data privacy;Crowdsensing;Decision making;Data collection;Reliability engineering;Real-time systems;Sensors","","1","","17","IEEE","26 Aug 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the approaches require a lot of human labor to label training data for radio map (fingerprint) construction. To address this issue, in this paper, we proposed an unsupervised framework to learn a Wi-Fi radio map in an indoor environment. Unlike conventional approaches that depend on a simulated radio map or a prior radio propagation model to reduce human efforts, our method uses Wi-Fi and IMU signals collecting by crowdsourcing to build a robust radio map automatically. More concretely, four types of constraints are fused by the proposed radio map optimization procedure. They include the alignment of Wi-Fi landmarks, the displacement constraint, the manifold-based smooth constraint, and the inter-trajectory constraints. Our experiment results also show the effectiveness of the unsupervised radio map.","","978-1-5090-4017-9","10.1109/ICCE-China.2017.7991004","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7991004","","Trajectory;Optimization;Wireless fidelity;Fingerprint recognition;Transmission line measurements;Manifolds;Mobile computing","","1","","5","IEEE","27 Jul 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
