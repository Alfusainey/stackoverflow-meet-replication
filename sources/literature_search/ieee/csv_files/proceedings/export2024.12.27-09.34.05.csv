Moreover, our method does not upload/download model parameters, thus saving bandwidth resources and avoiding data security problems caused by model parameter leakage.

With increasing usage of collaborative learning these forums and communities are known as a suitable platform that facilitates collaborative activities. Many learners refer to these forums to find answers for their questions. Unfortunately due to huge amount of information on these forums, finding the appropriate answers is becoming more time consuming. In addition, there is no suitable mechanism to measure the reliability of answers being provided. To overcome these challenges a new supporting tool for e-Learning in online communities and forums is proposed. This supporting tool consists of three main components. At first relevant questions to learners query is found. The next component finds the best answers for these relevant questions. Finally, selected answers are summarized and an abstract view of these answers that contains the most important information is returned to the learner. To evaluate the proposed tool the contents of 30 discussions are collected.

Effective customer relationships could help enterprises deliver services to customers based on their needs, preferences, or past transactions. In this context, many discussions have already been presented where Consumer Support Systems (CSS) is most recently introduced that alleviates the shortcomings in other approaches by a 4-layer framework of collaborative mechanisms to support effective information/service provision between enterprises and customers. Since in CSS customers get used to participate in various communities to share or co-learn information about their experiences or requests on enterprises, a comprehensive structure for such information is therefore necessary for its easy sharing or co-learning among these customers. For this need and as a pristine way for knowledge-sharing by ontology, we present in this paper a method for the construction of an ontology that describes customer information with an easy understood structure. The method starts from the specification of the ontology based on the experiences of customers, through the browsing of their new ideas, and ends with the verification of its consistency. To illustrate, the method is applied in an exemplified application for travel arrangement.","","978-1-4244-5263-7","10.1109/ICIME.2010.5477723","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5477723","customer relationship management;community;customer information;ontology;method","Ontologies;Cascading style sheets;Information management;Vocabulary;Collaboration;Customer relationship management;Context-aware services;Knowledge management;Intelligent agent","","","","31","IEEE","3 Jun 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We design an large scale empirical study which characterizes elite developers' activity profiles and identifies the relationships between their effort allocations and project outcomes across five ecosystems.

Further, the development of information and communication technology (ICT) infrastructures with new networking features, such as Internet and wireless services, has accentuated the importance of managing knowledge flows rather than the flow of goods. As a consequence, R&D is increasingly undertaken in networks spanning different technology fields, industry and national boundaries. New forms of collaboration are also emerging, ranging from informal bilateral collaboration to highly complex multilateral and multi-layered networks. At the same time competition is intensifying due to the global reach of firms. The knowledge network approach within the framework of the AMI@Work can be used to model community formation based on the competencies of individuals in a collaborative setting. This paper develops an entity-concept connectivity model by including complementary concepts in concept proximity measure of Fuchs, Kittovski and Köhler and by applying the Axelrod landscape modelling to analyse the utility of collaboration. The model suggests some new research directions to further deepen our understanding of knowledge sharing and innovation in the ICT sector. The concept proximity measure is defined as the logarithm of the sum of the relevancies of concept classes of the collaborating parties. The utility of collaboration is defined similarly as the energy measure in landscape modelling. The utility is the sum of the products between the distances of collaboration and the number of alliances between the collaborating parties. One application of the model is the analysis of firm alliances based on concept proximity measure calculated from the patent references. The example shows that there is an inverse-U shaped utility distribution of firm pairs with respect to the concept proximity measure of the corresponding firms.","","978-1-5090-0600-7","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7458652","Firm Collaboration;Collaborative Work;Strategic R&D Alliances;Patents;Concept Relevance;Concept Proximity","Acceleration","","","","11","","25 Apr 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Information granules and their computing, which give rise to the framework of Granular Computing, deliver interesting opportunities to endow processing with an important facet of human-centricity. This facet directly implies that the underlying processing supports non-numeric data inherently associated with the variable perception of humans and generates results being seamlessly comprehended by users. Given that systems, which are quite commonly become distributed and hierarchical, managing granular information in hierarchical and distributed architectures is of growing interest, especially when invoking mechanisms of knowledge generation and knowledge sharing. The outstanding feature of human centricity of Granular Computing along with essential fuzzy set-based constructs constitutes the crux of our study. We elaborate on some new directions of knowledge elicitation and quantification realized in the setting of fuzzy sets. With this regard, we concentrate on an idea of knowledge-based clustering, which aims at the seamless realization of the data-expertise design of information granules. It is also emphasized that collaboration and reconciliation of locally available knowledge give rise to the concept of higher type information granules. The other interesting directions enhancing human centricity of computing with fuzzy sets, deals with non-numeric, semi-qualitative characterization of information granules (fuzzy sets) as well as inherent evolving capabilities of associated human-centric systems. We discuss a suite of algorithms facilitating a qualitative assessment of fuzzy sets, formulate a series of associated optimization tasks guided by well-formulated performance indexes, and discuss the underlying essence of the resulting solutions.","","978-1-4244-8042-5","10.1109/COGINF.2010.5599759","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5599759","","Fuzzy sets;Computational intelligence;Computers;Software engineering;Humans;Knowledge based systems;Cybernetics","","","","","IEEE","11 Oct 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The challenge is that there is no systematic way of capturing, organizing, storing, sharing and using this knowledge to enhance innovation and service delivery in some of the government departments. To address this, there are a number of knowledge management (KM) initiatives across all government spheres, namely, national, provincial and local. One such initiative was a KM audit project by Sonjana Business Solutions in one of South African government departments. The department is currently experiencing serious challenges with respect to knowledge management issues. The KM audit was to establish a better picture of KM limitations. This research paper is a result of that KM audit project.

It because the only product produced by Research Institute is knowledge. P2LD LIPI (Deep Sea Research Center — Indonesian Institute of Sciences) has faced problems; one of them is limited human resources, noticed from the number of available researchers who are mostly in their retirement period. It requires right solution to solve it, which is right KM implementation to give positive impact for organization advancement. That problem is noticed before the existence of knowledge sharing culture and lack of KM understanding, so knowledge is only owned by an individual. The current KM implementation do not give the expected result yet and need to be evaluated the reason and how to solve. Instrument that is used in research has been tested both validity and reliability. This study used OCAI as instrument that researched the effect of organization culture to KM process and questionnaires as instrument that researched the effect of organization structure to KM process in P2LD LIPI. Using simple regression analysis tests KM process and organization structure. From analysis, P2LD organization culture is expected to have clan and hierarchy cultures with requirements clan dominates and from organization structure and KM process are resulted an analysis that there is an influence between those 2 variables. From this research, it can be concluded that organization culture at P2LD is expected to be clan and hierarchy that are flexible, caring each other, stable and controllable. Besides that, there will be top-down information flow and working in team.","","978-1-5386-2930-7","10.1109/ICIMTech.2017.8273563","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8273563","Knowledge Management;Organization Culture;Organization Structure;KM Process;OCAI","Organizations;Instruments;Portals;Cultural differences;Reliability;Retirement;Regression analysis","","","","48","IEEE","1 Feb 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This becomes more important than ever with newest process technologies and the scale of 450mm fabs that are under consideration, driving an ever increasing value of each wafer. One key step towards this goal is to synchronize the timing of scheduled maintenance of peripheral equipment and critical sub-systems such as vacuum pumps and abatement (exhaust management) systems with that of the process tools they support. Transitioning from calendar-based to a knowledge-based solution is dependent upon increased intelligence within the critical sub-systems and concomitant improvements in communications between them and the process tool. This demands a significant degree of intelligence in the peripheral equipment itself so that an accurate Remaining Useful Life (RUL) indication can be realized, and used to synchronize maintenance activities with the maintenance schedule of the process tool. Effective knowledge sharing direct to the process tool and/or via the factory information and control system (FICS) is required, allowing the peripheral equipment to interactively calculate RUL, assess the risk of operation beyond routine maintenance intervals and to potentially suggest appropriate actions to minimize this risk. Robust risk analyses can be performed to determine if RUL of critical sub-systems can be managed in such a way to extend operation until the next planned process tool PM, enabling a later synchronized maintenance activity. In the absence of alternative solutions the least risk decision is to schedule maintenance activity and absorb the implied cost if a fault is predicted to occur before the next tool PM. Together, these approaches empower the tool owner to make evidence based judgments of both the pro's and con's of synchronization with other maintenance procedures. This paper discusses how such synchronization might be achieved, and the risks and considerations required for a successful implementation.","2376-6697","978-1-4673-0351-4","10.1109/ASMC.2012.6212892","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6212892","predictive;adaptive;maintenance;synchronization;remaining useful life;vacuum;abatement","Maintenance engineering;Computer peripherals;Synchronization;Vacuum systems;Fingerprint recognition;Process control;Production facilities","","","","3","IEEE","7 Jun 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the looming threat of diseases poses a significant risk to crop destruction. The “PlantCare: Community-Driven Agri-Aid” initiative is taken to address the problem of a comprehensive platform for plant care and disease diagnosis, focusing on six critical crops. With a dataset comprising 8,000 samples and 27 distinct disease categories, our goal is to empower farmers and agricultural enthusiasts with the tools and knowledge needed to protect their crops. The project includes functionalities such as plant identification, disease diagnosis using a CNN algorithm, disease classification through KNN, and crop advisory services. The Amity Social SDK facilitates a community forum that promotes knowledge sharing, and a chat-bot assistance feature, utilizing the Microsoft Bot API. Plant health assessment involves evaluating leaf texture, color, and disease presence, with scores normalized using min-max scaling and weighted accordingly. The platform delivers an intuitive plant care experience, allowing users to identify plants, detect diseases, and receive timely crop care alerts through push notifications. The community-driven approach promotes collaborative learning, and the health scoring system enables informed decisions about plants. Integrating technology with agricultural knowledge, PlantCare is a holistic solution for Indian farmers, representing a significant stride towards sustainable agriculture.

To address these issues, we propose a novel software-defined architecture integrating LDPC communication coding, empowered by GPU-CPU integration. Our approach enhances resilience to disruptions by implementing wireless channel coding in both server-side weight aggregation and client-side local training. The GPU-CPU acceleration significantly boosts computing efficiency. Experimental results showcase a remarkable 100x speedup and a 10x improvement in error reduction compared to state-of-the-art WFL schemes.

Text mining of big data is used to extract the laws and rules that are implied in safety models, making these laws and rules more transparent by stating them explicitly and providing visualization. Currently, the ability to process information on coal mine safety management is insufficient for resolving the problems of inefficiency and a lack of knowledge. In this paper, based on a knowledge map service, the analysis of coal mine safety maps for management purposes and the acquisition of situational factors in a multidimensional space for innovation is divided into the current situation and the expectations hidden in the data. Multidimensional situations and the role of each component’s situation require specific analysis and discussion of the issues of human-computer interactions and situations. Five levels of users' spatial knowledge demand are proposed and analyzed by combining the coal mine safety demand, multidimensional situational factors and spatial knowledge map service system. The service process model of user space knowledge acquisition and the organizational structure of the service system are constructed. Then, the coal mine safety text is classified, and a self-adaptive weight deep learning classification algorithm is used to classify the coal mine safety knowledge data to verify the difference in the classification effect of two classification algorithms. Finally, based on the correct classification of coal mine safety knowledge data, the mining of hazard association rules is performed. From the perspectives of knowledge workers, knowledge bases, and the combination of knowledge workers and knowledge bases, the mode of knowledge analysis of coal mine safety maps and its specific applications in intelligent searches, knowledge sharing and knowledge optimization are discussed.","","979-8-3503-0245-5","10.1109/ICSP58490.2023.10248223","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10248223","Spatial knowledge map service;Knowledge of coal mine safety;Knowledge analysis of coal mine safety map;Clustering classification algorithm","Text categorization;Knowledge based systems;Signal processing algorithms;Safety management;Data models;Hazards;Coal mining","","","","22","IEEE","19 Sep 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The searches took place in October 2020. Based on a group of 19 scientific articles belonging to the study areas: management, business, operations and economics, the authors analyzed the research and recommendations in the context of organizations. The most frequent relationship between the constructs presented was quality management as a facilitating element and knowledge management as a mediating element in achieving organizational performance. The most frequent knowledge management practices and processes were knowledge sharing and acquisition. Regarding the principles and practices of quality management, a greater number of articles using the principles of TQM were identified. Knowledge management and quality management have a positive relationship in the performance of organizations. The use of only two variables can help in the identification of relationships, although an analysis of organizational performance in an integrated manner requires an analysis from different perspectives, including new variables.

This problem is very important because, in order to discover required services effectively and efficiently, the consumers need to know more about the published services. We should consider how customers represent their requirements and how service providers represent their services, and hence to bridge the knowledge gap between the service providers and the service consumers. This paper investigates the use of structured description and representation of natural language in the matchmaking of web-services with customer requirements. A semantic framework for the representation of such descriptions is motivated based upon the limitations of current approaches. A matchmaking algorithm is given along with a concrete example of how the matchmaking process may be applied.","","978-0-7695-3395-7","10.1109/ICEBE.2008.118","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4690616","","Semantic Web;Service oriented architecture;Web services;Knowledge engineering;Computer architecture;Bridges;Natural languages;Concrete;Publishing","","","","14","IEEE","2 Dec 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Traditional supply chain architecture is less agile and is unable to configure automatically due to ever changing business environment or business needs, in other words we can say it is not adaptive in nature. We propose an agent structure, which can be used to overcome the above mentioned problems thus giving more agility to supply chain. We focus on two aspects of supply chain management.

Within a few months, academics responded to the lack of contact with students by generating and using online content to deliver their modules. Even before this forced change, curricula had already undergone significant development. But whereas teaching methods had morphed over time, learning approaches and assessment strategy remained stagnant. The change to online teaching and assessment during the pandemic revealed that in many modules, assessments are still testing at low cognitive levels, rewarding recall instead of understanding. It also revealed that plagiarism and collusion in online assessments were rife, and the type of assessments offered created an enabling environment for this. Students seldom engage with the course material during the semester, except for assignments. Almost all learning occurs in the short period before the main exam session (or in recent years, with the possibility of deferring exams, the students can extend this period into the supplementary session). The change to continuous assessment placed an unusual strain on students accustomed to this particular learning style. They were now forced to engage with material throughout the semester. In this study the student network was considered. Counter intuitively, this has actually strengthened as a result of the pandemic, with students using a variety of communication platforms to engage with one another. As part of this work, the informal study groups and other partnerships that have arisen were investigated as a means to support the formal teaching program. A system based on peer-to-peer interaction was piloted in an undergraduate chemical engineering program, over two modules at the third- and fourth-year levels. The system awards points for various peer activities that usually occur in an informal way, which can be translated into bonus marks on assessments. In doing so, the system addressed a potentially contentious but powerful supposition, i.e. is there a way to exploit the knowledge sharing potential of plagiarism and collusion for a better purpose? Such systems have traditionally been used in businesses and large corporations to motivate and reward employees. The recent pilot has demonstrated that the system, as implemented within an undergraduate program and linked to assessments that test at higher cognitive levels, can improve student engagement and performance.","","978-1-6654-7528-0","10.1109/WEEF-GEDC54384.2022.9996225","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9996225","peer-to-peer;student networks;online teaching;learning interventions;engineering education","COVID-19;Pandemics;Distance learning;Plagiarism;Chemical engineering;Collaboration;Peer-to-peer computing","","","","12","IEEE","3 Jan 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, improving knowledge transfer processes represents a challenge for most of the small and medium size consulting firms. In recent years, the terminology `knowledge management' initiative has been introduced. The concept of knowledge management (KM) is seen as the solution through the inculcation of knowledge sharing via various tools and techniques in managing the knowledge within parties in construction. Through intranet as one of the KM tools, the organisations are able to create, acquire and transfer knowledge. The aim of this research paper was to investigate how quantity surveying (QS) consulting firms is exploiting intranet technology in facilitating knowledge management in order to deliver quantity surveying services efficiently. A qualitative approach through semi-structured interviews was adopted as the method used to establish current knowledge management practices and the tools used for sharing knowledge and learning. The study finds that the use of intranet has not been used to its fullest potential due to the barriers and challenges in using intranet as KM tools. Thus has created some problems with regard to deliver quantity surveying services efficiently. A discussion is also included on the future research direction for the development of a conceptual framework to support the integration of quantity's surveyor services with relevant knowledge management initiative.","","978-1-4673-4617-7","10.1109/CHUSER.2012.6504335","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6504335","Intranet;Knowledge Management;Consulting Firms;Quantity Surveying","","","","","13","IEEE","16 May 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

UC will be achieved after research on 3 major components: contextual collaboration, mobile collaboration, and integrated collaboration. UC will require a collaborative infrastructure as the foundation of future collaborative systems for seamless collaboration among people working together. Collaborative infrastructures will offer seamlessly integrated context-aware flexible support for distributed collaboration among individuals and will draw on service-oriented reference models for massive semantic collaboration. Collaborative infrastructures will provide proactive support for pervasive human collaboration within their own organisations, with other organisations and with virtual communities of experts and of practice. Collaborative infrastructure will provide system components that comply with the Service Oriented Architectures allowing specific applications for group-driven composition of systems components to support synchronous and asynchronous teamwork freeing users from routine to focus on creativity with an effective use of distributed knowledge and competences.

With the rapid growth in learning resources available over the Internet, it has become more difficult for teachers to find useful resources. Although several local service providers (25 counties) in Taiwan are organizing their existing resources, each provider only serves teachers in the local county. In this paper, we propose and implement a union catalog of learning resources, called the ""Education to e-Learning"" (EtoE) platform, to coordinate the resources of the 25 counties in Taiwan. Generally speaking, EtoE is an OAI-PMH service provider that can collect all the resources spread over the Internet. It can also provide resource browsing for learning skills, full-text/metadata search, personal resource management etc. We anticipate that EtoE will become an important medium between teachers and local service providers. With the EtoE platform, teachers will be able to utilize the resources of other counties, as well as their own, and we hope this will also encourage them to share and reuse learning resources. Furthermore, EtoE will help educators form knowledge sharing communities and establish CSCL in the future. The two main techniques used in the EtoE platform are: the IEEE LOM metadata standard, which is customized and localized to describe the learning resources; and OAI-PMH, which is used for metadata harvesting.","","0-7695-2274-2","10.1109/EEE.2005.77","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1402362","","Electronic learning;Resource management;Collaborative work;Educational programs;Computer science education;Information science;Learning systems;Organizing;Web and internet services;Portals","","","","17","IEEE","11 Apr 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This amplifies the popularity bias of doctors in each rating. In this paper, a rating model is proposed based on graph attention networks (GAT) to address this problem. This model makes full use of the characteristics and relationships of doctors to create similar trends in the RP of similar doctors by using graph data.

The pharmaceutical industry accelerated its processes to develop reliable vaccines. So far, six major firms have rolled out COVID-19 vaccines: Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, Johnson & Johnson, AstraZeneca, Sputnik, and Sinopharm. The global vaccination campaign kicked off in December 2020. Although over 905 million vaccines have been administered worldwide, there is an ongoing effort to vaccinate the remaining six billion people on the planet. A solid and effective supply chain strategy is essential for the equitable distribution of vaccines worldwide. Currently, there is a significant disparity in vaccine allocation among countries. This study explores the application of business intelligence systems to tackle this challenge. Implementing a sophisticated knowledge-driven supply chain system will lead to a more effective and efficient strategy for distributing the COVID-19 vaccine. This internationally monitored supply chain system will verify the volume and the paths of the vaccine shipments. As an intelligent knowledge-sharing platform, it will provide accurate data on the number of doses dispatched, including the specifics of each consignment's time and date. Furthermore, it will assist countries in understanding and planning the vaccine distribution logistics.","","979-8-3503-9496-2","10.1109/ICCR61006.2024.10533075","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10533075","Business Intelligent;Application;Corona Vaccine;Knowledge Sharing","COVID-19;Technological innovation;Planets;Supply chains;Solids;Vaccines;Planning;Resource management;Reliability;Resilience","","","","24","IEEE","22 May 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Because, E-learning techniques are getting very popular in Sri Lanka. Students should be allowed to learn anytime, anywhere and at their own place. Teachers should be able to keep collection attractive questions and course materials online. Teachers who are from different schools should be able to share resources and exchange ideas through the Internet. The motivation for this research is to solve the problems of shortage of online resources for students under the condition of high student-teacher ratio in Sri Lanka. In order to solve this problem, our research group developed a prototype system called KISSEL. The Knowledge Integration Servers System for E-Learning (KISSEL) is a knowledge sharing platform for E-learning and sustainability sciences which is focused mainly on Asian-Pacific countries. Our system is mainly for school teachers and school children in Asian Pacific countries.","","978-1-4673-2334-5","10.1109/ITHET.2012.6246070","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6246070","E-learning;KISSEL;E-learning Management System;E-learning Techniques;Secondary Education","Educational institutions;Servers;Electronic learning;Materials;Information technology;Communications technology","","","","6","IEEE","23 Jul 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
