The same properties that promise breakthrough solutions — small size and large populations — present unique challenges to generating controlled motion. We want to use large swarms of robots to perform manipulation tasks; unfortunately, human-swarm interaction studies as conducted today are limited in sample size, are difficult to reproduce, and are prone to hardware failures. We present an alternative. This paper examines the perils, pitfalls, and possibilities we discovered by launching SwarmControl.net, an online game where players steer swarms of up to 500 robots to complete manipulation challenges. We record statistics from thousands of players, and use the game to explore aspects of large-population robot control. We present the game framework as a new, open-source tool for large-scale user experiments. Our results have potential applications in human control of micro- and nanorobots, supply insight for automatic controllers, and provide a template for large online robotic research experiments.","1050-4729","978-1-4799-3685-4","10.1109/ICRA.2014.6907264","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6907264","","Robot sensing systems;Servers;Noise;Sociology;Statistics;Browsers","","12","","22","IEEE","29 Sep 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this article, we propose the establishment of a separate verification layer for sensitive wireless data powered by crowdsourced sensors connected to the Internet and apply it to the aviation domain. We first validate the need for independent data verification in air traffic control networks, where all wireless communication is conducted in the clear and thus subject to manipulation. To counter this threat, we develop a comprehensive model for the verification of wireless communication based on massively distributed data collection and outline how it can be used to immediately improve the security of unprotected air traffic control networks. By combining several different methods based on the content and the physical characteristics of aircraft signals, our system is able to detect typical injection, modification and jamming attacks. We further develop a trust model to defend against potential insider threats based on compromised sensors. We illustrate our approach using the crowdsourced sensor network OpenSky, which captures large parts of civil air traffic communication around the globe. We analyse the security of our approach and show that it can quickly, cheaply, and effectively defend against even sophisticated attacks.","2325-5374","978-9949-9904-1-2","10.23919/CYCON.2017.8240336","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8240336","critical infrastructures;wireless security;air traffic control;crowdsourcing;sensor networks;participatory sensing","Wireless communication;Aircraft;Security;Communication system security;Sensors;Air traffic control;Wireless sensor networks","","12","","40","","28 Dec 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

But still, such hybrid crowd sourcing workflows can be difficult to approach, and they are often designed in an ad-hoc fashion. Therefore, in this paper, we extensively investigate such crowd sourcing workflows as described in the literature, and abstract generic design patterns, which codify commonly recurring challenges and their best-practice solutions. Each design pattern is described and discussed with a special focus on its requirements, constraints, and effects on the overall workflow. We illustrate the practicality of these patterns by providing real-world application examples where such patterns can or have been applied. Furthermore, we show-case how the individual design patterns can be extended and combined to support more complex workflows.

A monitoring application may require different types of sensing data, while under a budget constraint. This paper explores the crucial problem of maximizing the aggregate data utility of heterogeneous sensing tasks while maintaining utility-centric fairness across different tasks under a budget constraint. In particular, we take the redundancy of sensing data into account. This problem is highly challenging given its unique characteristics including the intrinsic trade off between aggregate data utility and fairness, and the large number of smartphones. We propose a fairness-aware distributed approach to solving this problem. To overcome the intractability of the problem, we decompose it to two sub problems of recruiting smartphones under a budget constraint and allocating workloads of sensing tasks. For the first sub problem, we propose an efficient greedy algorithm which has a constant approximation ratio of two. For the second problem, we apply dual based decomposition based on which we design a distributed algorithm for determining the workloads of different tasks on each recruited smartphone. We have implemented our distributed algorithm on a windows-based server and Android-based smartphones. With extensive simulations we demonstrate that our approach achieves high aggregate data utility while maintaining good utility-centric fairness across sensing tasks.","0190-3918","978-1-4673-7587-0","10.1109/ICPP.2015.67","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7349613","","Sensors;Smart phones;Aggregates;Redundancy;Distributed algorithms;Resource management;Mobile communication","","10","","12","IEEE","10 Dec 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This semi-supervised, dimensionality reduction transfer learning method estimates the location of unlabeled crowdsourced radio signal observations by aligning them with the calibration fingerprints and the simulated radio map in a low-dimensional space. It thus reduces the calibration cost and can be easily deployed in any indoor environment given its floor plan and few calibration fingerprints. In addition to simple deployment, our solution can easily re-construct new radio maps in cases of changes in time, device or floor plans, which significantly reduces the large re-calibration load. Testing results show that the proposed solution can achieve as low as 6.4 to 6 dBm root mean square error in radio signal estimation with 15% to 30% of the full fingerprinting load.","","978-1-4673-2073-3","10.1109/ISTEL.2012.6483011","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6483011","Indoor Radio Maps;Transfer Learning;Radio Propagation Models;Manifold Alignment","Calibration;Manifolds;Indoor environments;Estimation;Correlation;Testing;Load modeling","","10","","12","IEEE","21 Mar 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In most existing studies, the results of the task assignment cannot satisfy the workers and tasks at the same time. This is because only one-sided preferences are taken into account. Moreover, tasks are always assigned based on the locations of workers instead of the trajectories. Accordingly, they are not appropriate to the specific applications, such as carpool. Inspired by this, we investigate an interesting problem of task assignment, namely bilateral preference-aware task assignment (BPTA), with the goal of maximizing the overall satisfaction of workers and tasks by assigning tasks to suitable workers based on their routine trajectories. To tackle this problem effectively, we first propose greedy algorithms, namely task preference priority greedy and worker preference priority greedy algorithms, which are task-driven and worker-driven, respectively. Although these algorithms can solve the BPTA problem effectively, they cannot ensure the stability of the task assignment results. In other words, there can be better choices for some workers and tasks. Accordingly, we further explore deferred acceptance algorithms to find a stable matching for workers and tasks by simultaneously considering the preferences of workers and tasks. Moreover, two optimizing strategies, including a parallel strategy and a top-$k$ strategy, are introduced to boost the performance in handling the BPTA problem. Extensive experiments on both real and synthetic datasets have validated the efficiency and effectiveness of our proposed algorithms.","2375-026X","978-1-6654-0883-7","10.1109/ICDE53745.2022.00172","NSFC(grant numbers:62172146,62172157); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9835392","bilateral preference;stable matching;spatial crowdsourcing;task assignment","Greedy algorithms;Crowdsourcing;Conferences;Data engineering;Real-time systems;Trajectory;Task analysis","","10","","42","IEEE","2 Aug 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

At the same time, over-the-top providers strive to offer high-quality streaming experiences to satisfy user expectations. Here, energy consumption and QoE partly depend on the same system parameters. Hence, a joint view is needed for their evaluation. In this paper, we perform a first analysis of both end-user power efficiency and Quality of Experience of a video streaming service. We take a crowdsourced dataset comprising 447,000 streaming events from YouTube and estimate both the power consumption and perceived quality. The power consumption is modeled based on previous work which we extended towards predicting the power usage of different devices and codecs. The user-perceived QoE is estimated using a standardized model.

A size-specified community creation method using multiple social contexts is also proposed.","","978-1-4673-4825-6","10.1109/APSCC.2012.20","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6478226","community based crowdsourcing;social awareness;disaster management;community creation","Communities;Disaster management;Social network services;Context;Humans;Satellites;Collaboration","","8","","35","IEEE","14 Mar 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The number of deaths caused by ADRs has greatly increased and led to many drug withdrawals in the last decades. Recent research findings indicate that most ADRs can be effectively prevented to some extent by using computer-aided information technologies. Though many spontaneous reporting systems (SRSs) have been built to enhance the pharma-covigilance, the ADRs data is still very sparse because the large amount of reports obtained from consumers contains insufficient hints to identify a possible causal relationship between an adverse event and drug. Based on this motivation, we developed Adverse-Tracking, a spontaneous reporting system of ADRs via crowd-sourcing. Our proposed system interacts with consumers through a Q&A interface and collects the ADR reports. The decision tree support vector machine (DTSVM) based on the genetic algorithm is used in our system to automate the Q&A procedure. We carried out experiments to evaluate the performance at Peking University First Hospital. As demonstrated by the results, our system is an efficient tool to track and discover adverse events in the consumers' reports of ADRs, which facilitates the detection of “signal”.","1938-1883","978-1-4799-2003-7","10.1109/ICC.2014.6883992","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6883992","","Knowledge based systems;Drugs;Decision trees;Signal detection;Genetic algorithms;Biological cells","","8","","22","IEEE","28 Aug 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We relate EMC to existing sociological and psychological concepts and argue that it lies at the intersection of human computation, social computing and crowd sourcing. EMC is a way in which new problems and discoveries can be tackled, for example as necessitated by ""wicked"" problems, ethnography and culture. We relate EMC to diverse disciplines and point to ways in which the concept may develop in future. We exemplify EMC by presenting a case study where participation in location-based social networks is used to discover the correlation between mobility and human personality traits.

In this paper, we propose an integrated system, called Crowd SMILE, using web, social and mobile technologies to provide a unified system that allows for easy organization, accessing, and reuse of learning content within a social and collaborative environment to support LLL. Content in the Crowd SMILE system is authored and organized by crowd sourcing the task to users of a Social Networking Service (SNS) platform. The learning content will then be organized according to location-based contexts so that any learner may easily find and retrieve it. Content may then be searched and accessed via an outdoor exploratory activity using a mobile phone application that employs an intuitive mobile augmented reality (MAR) user interface. The system usability of the Crowd SMILE is evaluated by applying the Computer System Usability Questionnaire (CSUQ).

Given the difficulty in finding and accessing a large enough sample of abuse ground truth from the Twitter platform, we built and deployed a custom crawler that we use to judiciously collect a new dataset from the Twitter platform with the aim of characterizing the nature of abusive users, a.k.a abusive “birds”, in the wild.

The former includes metadata about the account itself, while the latter is computed from the social graph among the sender and the receiver of each message. Attribute-based features are useful to characterize user's accounts in OSN, while graph-based features can reveal the dynamics of information dissemination across the network.

Specifically our focus is to identify the right customer that has been manifested in various ways under a common name in a database using In-house Crowd sourcing-based Entity Resolution approach (ICER). The ICER takes the list of possible duplicates into consideration (which are pre-determined) and identifies the pair of record that has the maximum impact in achieving ER. Then, this pair is crowd sourced to Customer Service Representatives (CSRs) to have their input (labeling). ICER incorporates the principles of Human Intelligence Task (HIT) that aims to keep the questions asked to the CSR to a minimum. Two ICER approaches are proposed in this study based on probabilistic (modified approach of Whang et al) and active learning schemas.

Each mobile device is primarily used by a single user, so it's possible to have a personalized recognizer well matching to the characteristics of individual user. Although acoustic model personalization has been investigated for decades, much less work have been reported on personalizing language model, probably because of the difficulties in collecting enough personalized corpora. Previous work used the corpora collected from social networks to solve the problem, but constructing a personalized model for each user is troublesome. In this paper, we propose a universal recurrent neural network language model with user characteristic features, so all users share the same model, except each with different user characteristic features.

With the increasing complexity of tasks that are crowdsourced and the need of collaboration among workers, collaborative MCS (CMCS) has emerged to enable requesters to form teams of skilled IoT workers and promote their ability to cooperate together. To efficiently execute such tasks, optimizing the team recruitment process must be conducted. In this paper, we design a low complexity CMCS team recruitment approach that forms and hires a group of socially connected workers having sufficient skills to accomplish a CMCS task. Inspired from swam intelligence, the proposed recruitment approach enables project matching and virtual team formation according to four different fuzzy-logic-based criteria: level of expertise, social relationship strength, recruitment cost, and platform's confidence level. Applied to a real-world data set, experimental results illustrate the performances of the proposed genetic algorithm for CMCS recruitment and show that our approach outperforms the metaheuristic particle swarm optimization algorithm. Moreover, it is shown that the proposed approach achieves close performance to those of the baseline optimal integer linear program with significant computational saving.","","978-1-7281-8420-3","10.1109/GCAIoT51063.2020.9345852","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9345852","Social network;mobile crowdsourcing systems;IoT;swarm intelligence optimization;virtual team formation","Crowdsourcing;Virtual groups;Complexity theory;Internet of Things;Task analysis;Smart devices;Recruitment","","5","","20","IEEE","9 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A set of wireless devices forms a basic service set (BSS) connected to an access point (AP). However, large number of APs are deployed in the form of extended service set (ESS) to balance the traffic load and to provide seamless data connectivity. Recent studies show that in a public WiFi hotspot, a mobile device remains in the overlapping region of multiple APs. Due to geographically sparse distributions of mobile devices, an AP may need to keep its interfaces on to serve only a few devices which otherwise can be shifted to another active AP. In this paper, we develop CrowdAP, an energy balancing AP coordination mechanism; where the minimum number of APs are computed such that the underlying mobile devices can be served without any degradation in performance, while the rest of the APs can go to the sleep state to save power. We analyze the performance of CrowdAP through simulation as well as from testbed, and show that it is able to save significant energy in the network.","1938-1883","978-1-4799-6664-6","10.1109/ICC.2016.7510803","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7510803","Crowdsourcing;IEEE 802.11;Access Point;AP Coordination;Energy Efficiency","IEEE 802.11 Standard;Mobile handsets;Crowdsourcing;Wireless LAN;Wireless networks","","4","","16","IEEE","14 Jul 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Most of the tasks usually require expertise of workers from diverse domains, thus the problem can be reduced to that of team formation. In this work, we address the problem of assigning workers to tasks, where each task requires a set of skills and thus may require more than one worker to successfully complete the task. Given a set of tasks, and a set of workers each with a cost, the objective is to find mutually exclusive set of workers for each task, who can accomplish the task in the most cost-effective manner. The problem being NP-hard, we propose an approximation algorithm that attempts to find the best fit workers based on their collective intelligence for a single task. This approach selects workers in a manner that their expertise complements each other, hence maintaining a balance among the required skills. Such balanced assignment sets require lesser number of workers and reduce the overall cost. The approach is then extended to a set of N tasks. We show that the solution is (2+ α) approximate. The proposed algorithm is evaluated against different assignment schemes. Experimental results using real data show that our approach performs well.","","978-1-5090-5019-2","10.1109/GLOCOM.2017.8255048","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8255048","","Crowdsourcing;Approximation algorithms;Collective intelligence;Algorithm design and analysis;Electronic mail;Organizations","","4","","17","IEEE","15 Jan 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The server considers some area/landmark as the point of interest (POI), and distributes the request to the nodes to collect more information about them. Nodes take photos of POIs and share them among each other using store and forward paradigm, called Delay-tolerant Networks (DTNs) to send them to the server. Due to highly intermittent contact characteristics of nodes in a DTN network, and bandwidth and storage limitations, redundant photos need to be omitted in this forwarding technique whereas photos that cover different angles and views of the targets need to be shared. Another challenge is that, over time, some server-listed POIs may not be of importance whereas some new POIs might be of interest. In this work, we propose a scheme that is able to dynamically update the list of POIs based on the current photo metadata, with reduced consumption of the bandwidth, energy and the storage at nodes by sending only important photos of POIs.

While there exist platforms for crowdsourced data submission such as WiGLE, and methods such as dedicated wardriving, these can be costly, infrequent, and can easily become outdated. Regular data collection on Wi-Fi access points is necessary for better accuracy. For regular, inexpensive, and frequent data gathering, opportunistic wardriving is proposed, in which neighborhood public utility vehicles, such as the tricycle, are utilized to serve as vehicles for gathering network data. Leveraging public utility vehicles is inexpensive, and ensures regularity of data gathering because of their usual trips. Comparing this method with crowdsourced data, it is found that opportunistic wardriving is able to find at least 60% of the access points in an area.

We present results from four field tests where 261 participants provided 1,582 evaluations of current DRR strategies, and over 950 peer-to-peer evaluations on 280 textual and audio suggestions for how local government (i.e., barangays) could better support vulnerable groups (e.g., elderly, women, children, and people with disabilities) during typhoons and floods. Results suggest that individuals who engage in disaster drills are also likely to participate in their barangay's clean-up drives to reduce flooding risk by clearing drainage pathways and that those who participate in disaster drills are also likely to have enough emergency supplies for a disaster. High-rated suggestions for DRR strategies for vulnerable groups emphasize the need for communities to establish response teams that prioritize reaching out to vulnerable groups for coordination during a disaster.

Even though main cuisines such as French, Italian, Japanese, Chinese and Indian are always appreciated, they are not anymore the most popular. The new trend is fusion cuisine. A fusion cuisine is a combination of different main cuisines, this combination makes this cuisine new. The opening of a new restaurant proposing a new kind of cuisine produces a lot of excitement and people feel the need to try it and be part of this new culture. Yelp is a platform which publishes crowd-sourced reviews about different businesses, in particular, restaurants. Yelp allows the possibility to declare for each restaurant the kind of cuisine. Unfortunately, since the restaurants in the Yelp database are not often generated by the owners but by the users creating the reviews, there is no much information about the kind of cuisine, especially for restaurants providing fusion ones. In this paper, we address the problem of identifying restaurants proposing new kinds of cuisines by using their Yelp reviews. These new cuisines can be completely new or fusion cuisines. Discriminating between main cuisines and fusion cuisines is very difficult because fusion cuisines are similar to the main ones even if they are conceptually different. We propose 4Phase, a semi-supervised procedure that trains Long Short-Term Memory with only the text reviews of the restaurants providing main cuisines. The trained LSTM is ultimately used as a feature generator in combination with a standard novelty detection model (e.g., Gaussian Mixture Models). We perform experiments on Yelp to separate restaurants providing main cuisines from the ones providing completely new cuisines or fusion ones. In this experiments, our 4Phase procedure outperforms all the baselines (term frequency, Doc2Vec, autoencoder LSTM, etc.) and reaches 0.91 of both AUROC and MAP.","","978-1-5386-6805-4","10.1109/ICMLA.2018.00241","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8614266","Deep learning;Novelty detection;semi unsuperevised;Recurrent Neural Network;LSTM","Feature extraction;Training;Standards;Gaussian mixture model;Task analysis;Support vector machines","","2","","27","IEEE","17 Jan 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The success of the mobile crowd-sourcing platform depends mainly on its effectiveness in engaging crowd-workers, and recent studies have shown that compared to the pull-based approach, which relies on crowd-workers to browse and commit to tasks they would want to perform, the push-based approach can take into consideration of worker's daily routine, and generate highly effective recommendations. As a result, workers waste less time on detours, plan more in advance, and require much less planning effort. However, the push-based systems are not without drawbacks. The major concern is the potential privacy invasion that could result from the disclosure of individual's mobility traces to the crowd-sourcing platform. In this paper, we first demonstrate specific threats of continuous sharing of users locations in such push-based crowd-sourcing platforms. We then propose a simple yet effective location perturbation technique that obfuscates certain user locations to achieve privacy guarantees while not affecting the quality of the recommendations the system generates.We use the mobility traces data we obtained from our urban campus to show the trade-offs between privacy guarantees and the quality of the recommendations associated with the proposed solution. We show that obfuscating even 75% of the individual trajectories will affect the user to make another extra 1.8 minutes of detour while gaining 62.5% more uncertainty of his location traces.","","978-1-5090-4338-5","10.1109/PERCOMW.2017.7917563","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7917563","","Trajectory;Privacy;Mobile communication;Data privacy;Servers;Buildings;Sensors","","2","","22","IEEE","4 May 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We attribute the source of these differences to a set of features visible only in the 3D views and introduce a technique for labeling these features on the 2D maps. The second study reveals that using labeled 2D maps produces annotation data very similar to that obtained using 3D images.

A geo-location database administrator (DBA) maintains spectrum availability over its service region by periodically collecting and processing spatio-temporal spectrum data to construct Radio Environment Maps (REMs). To attract mobile users in the outsourced sensing tasks of spectrum measurements, crowdsourced spectrum sensing has great potential in REM construction. However, false measurements submitted by faulty/malicious users cannot be neglected. Constructing better REMs based on crowdsourced spectrum sensing remains an open challenge, especially considering privacy protection of mobile users. In this work, we introduce TAC-REM (Trust-aware Crowdsourced spectrum sensing for the resulting REM optimization), a novel differentially-private reverse auction mechanism. TAC-REM allows the DBA to iteratively select trustworthy spectrum measurements in the presence of false measurements. During each iteration, the DBA employs a spatio-temporal scheme for trustworthiness evaluation, which acts as a guide for user recruitment in crowdsourced spectrum sensing. The proposed adaptive greedy algorithm gradually incorporates the most trustworthy spectrum measurements. The process of user recruitment can be modeled as a stochastic submodular maximization problem, while guaranteeing budget feasibility, approximate REM accuracy maximization, differential bid privacy.

A computational modeling of this phenomenon must take into account where people look in order to evaluate which are the salient locations (spatial distribution of the fixations), when they look in those locations to understand the temporal development of the exploration (temporal order of the fixations), and how they move from one location to another with respect to the dynamics of the scene and the mechanics of the eyes (dynamics). State-of-the-art models focus on learning saliency maps from human data, a process that only takes into account the spatial component of the phenomenon and ignore its temporal and dynamical counterparts. In this work we focus on the evaluation methodology of models of human visual attention. We underline the limits of the current metrics for saliency prediction and scanpath similarity, and we introduce a statistical measure for the evaluation of the dynamics of the simulated eye movements. While deep learning models achieve astonishing performance in saliency prediction, our analysis shows their limitations in capturing the dynamics of the process. We find that unsupervised gravitational models, despite of their simplicity, outperform all competitors. Finally, exploiting a crowd-sourcing platform, we present a study aimed at evaluating how strongly the scanpaths generated with the unsupervised gravitational models appear plausible to naive and expert human observers.","2161-4407","978-1-7281-6926-2","10.1109/IJCNN48605.2020.9207438","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9207438","Visual attention models;evaluation;scanpath;fixations;saliency;crowd-sourcing","Visualization;Computational modeling;Mathematical model;Measurement;Analytical models;Trajectory;Predictive models","","1","","43","IEEE","28 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Besides prebooked taxis, flagged taxis also run in many places of the world, allowing passengers to wave at the driver on the side of the road to flag down the taxi as it is approaching. For flagged taxis service, taxi drivers' passenger-refusal (TPR) behaviors have become a serious problem due to rush hours, bad weather and destination choosy, which hurt the living quality and the reputation of the city. With more and more GPS-equipped taxis and smart phones available, detecting such abnormal TPR behaviors from GPS trajectories has become feasible. In this paper, we model the TPR behaviors and develop a system named Crowd TPR to detect TPR behaviors in real time by combining traffic data and crowd sourcing. It efficiently serves real-time monitoring requests from the traffic administrators and generates proper pick-up spots for passengers to select. In our system, we firstly propose a dynamic grid granularity selection method to achieve efficient map-matching and build spatio-temporal index on the road network. Through modeling taxis' routing behaviors, we predict arriving locations of taxis and recommend pick-up spots for passengers to push cluster-based human intelligent tasks (HITs). After passengers submit HIT results to Crowd TPR, we verify TPR behaviors by modeling the anomalous features. We build our system using real trajectory datasets generated by 33,000+ taxis and validate the system with extensive evaluations including over 1-month user study.","","978-1-4799-7646-1","10.1109/UIC-ATC-ScalCom.2014.110","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7306929","flagged taxi;passenger-refusal;gps trajectory;crowdsourcing;human intelligent task","Public transportation;Trajectory;Roads;Vehicles;Indexes;Cities and towns;Real-time systems","","1","","32","IEEE","26 Oct 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To address this problem, this study as first step presents a consensus-based service assessment methodology that utilizes consensus theory to evaluate the service behavior for single QoS criteria using the power of crowd sourcing. For this purpose, trust level metrics are introduced to measure the strength of a consensus based on the trustworthiness levels of crowd members.

Web services provided by these platforms facilitate requesters to post tasks, retrieve results and incentivize crowd workers. However, service assurance associated with task execution by crowd workers is not provided by these platforms. Owing to the flexible, uncommitted, discretionary working patterns of online crowd workers, service assurance for task execution is considered to be beyond the service assurance offerings of existing crowd sourcing platforms. Enterprises however, require these guarantees to be able to adopt crowd sourcing in a profound manner. In this paper, we propose a Service Assurance Framework as a crowd sourcing platform augmenting service, that provides service assurance for task execution by crowd workers. The framework helps enterprise requesters to identify and engage with workers who possess suitable service assurance attributes. To the best of our knowledge, this work is a first of its kind, in providing service assurance associated with task execution by crowd workers, with respect to enterprise tasks. We implemented the proposed framework and conducted a four-week long, large scale crowd sourcing experiment involving digitization of forms posted by an enterprise requester.

However, the use of real-world case studies is not straightforward because 1.) there is a lack of open source repositories for real software design case studies and 2.) even if case studies are available, they are often reported without a standardized format, which may hinder the alignment between the case and the desired learning outcomes. To address the lack of software design case studies for educational purposes, we propose the idea of Open Design Case Study, a repository to crowdsource, curate, and recruit other educators to contribute case studies for teaching software design courses.

A typical problem for ride-sharing is to find an optimal route for each worker to serve the dynamically arriving requests with different objectives. Previous studies focus on the route planning on a single platform. However, a single platform may have an uneven distribution of supply and demand, which causes the platform to lose requests from lack of available workers. Luckily, some ride-sharing platforms provide the same service, which enables their collaborations. The inter-platform collaborations on ride-sharing can ease the worker shortages and greatly improve the service quality, but have not been studied yet. In this paper, we propose a Cross Online Ride-sharing (CORS) problem, which allows a platform to borrow the available workers from other platforms to serve its own requests. We first design two algorithms to select the optimal available worker from other platforms, ROWS and DOWS. ROWS randomly picks an available worker, while DOWS selects the optimal worker with the minimum additional travel distance calculated based on his/er predicted destination direction. Then, we design an efficient CORS framework that embeds the proposed optimal worker selection algorithms for the CORS problem.

This paper focuses on MCS in varied settings like surface, air, and high altitude. Currently, planning-based task assignment works better for one-to-one or one-to-many scenarios, with limited options for many-to-many situations. Improving platform utility, attracting top-quality crowd workers, and enhancing task completion efficiency are vital. To tackle these challenges, the paper introduces a spatial division algorithm using 3D Voronoi diagrams for complex environments. This algorithm utilizes task coordinates to delineate assignment spaces. Additionally, it introduces a two-stage many-to-many online task assignment algorithm (MOTA) that forecasts crowd workers’ arrival probabilities and combines auction-based incentives with differential evolution algorithms. MOTA ensures efficient matching of workers and tasks within spatio-temporal constraints, balancing both parties’ interests. Finally, comparative experiments on real datasets assess the proposed MOTA algorithm’s usability and effectiveness based on overall gain, running time, task count, and assignment rate.","2836-3868","979-8-3503-6855-0","10.1109/ICWS62655.2024.00032","National Natural Science Foundation of China; Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province; Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10707398","mobile crowdsourcing;task assignment;online;planning-based;bidirectional;multi-stage","Crowdsourcing;Three-dimensional displays;Web services;Prediction algorithms;Partitioning algorithms;Sensors;Delays;Resource management;Usability;Mobile computing","","","","29","IEEE","15 Oct 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Thus, this paper proposes a methodology and related tools to measure ground-level QoS, results of which can be utilised by DoT (Department of Telecommunications), Government of India for taking proactive steps to provide high-quality telecom coverage to all citizens, focusing on strategic areas achieving the goals of the National Digital Communication Policy 2018. To achieve this, a smartphone app was developed to collect data from citizens who can share their locations and cell phone signal data as volunteers. Considering the country's population of almost ~1.4 billion, a 1% volunteer rate would generate significant data for the server. A highly available server architecture design has been proposed to handle this massive data. Mobile BTS (Base Transceiver Station), topographical and meteorological data from the government will be used along with collected signal data. Machine learning will forecast data for the missing locations since there will be few nationwide volunteers.","","979-8-3503-0644-6","10.1109/ICCICA60014.2024.10584901","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10584901","telecom;telecommunication;mobile towers;geospatial in telecom;signal;quality of service;mobile signal strength;deep learning in telecom;Cassandra in telecom;coverage maps;signal strength prediction;weather in telecom;machine learning in telecom","Deep learning;Adaptation models;Machine learning algorithms;Government;Quality of service;Predictive models;Prediction algorithms","","","","28","IEEE","11 Jul 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

ASR is usually trained using a large quantity of labeled data, i.e., audio with text transcription. In many languages, however, text transcription is hard to find, e.g., in both Hokkien and Dinka, we found native speakers who had received all their primary education in some other language, and who therefore had difficulty writing in their own language. Fortunately, speech in every language is produced by human mouths, and designed to be interpreted by human ears. Speakers of a majority language (English, say, or Mandarin Chinese) are therefore able to make some sense of even the strangest language (Zulu, say, or Cantonese): language-unique distinctions are mostly lost, but universal distinctions such as consonant versus vowel are, for the most part, correctly transmitted. We can decode such mismatched transcripts using an information-theoretic decoder, resulting in a low-entropy probability distribution over the possible native-language transcriptions. Mismatched transcripts can be used to train ASR. Combining ten hours of mismatched transcripts with 12–48 minutes of native transcripts, if available, results in lower phone error rate. On the other hand, if we don't even know the native phoneme inventory, mismatched transcripts in two or more annotation languages can be used to infer the native phoneme inventory (with entropy depending on the distinctive feature inventory of the annotation languages).","2576-2303","978-1-5386-1823-3","10.1109/ACSSC.2017.8335558","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8335558","","Speech;Crowdsourcing;Task analysis;Tongue;Data models;Speech recognition;Education","","","","11","IEEE","16 Apr 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Today, applications of complex service-oriented systems can be found in crowd sourcing environments. In such environments, collaborations are typically short-lived and strongly influenced by incentives and actor behavior. As actors prove their reliable and dependable behavior in jointly performed activities, they become increasingly considered as invaluable partners. A social network builds a strong basis to enable successful collaborations between crowd members. In order to keep track of the dynamics in such systems, it is inevitable to apply an autonomous approach to manage social network structures automatically using captured interaction data. Thus, we introduce an adaptation concept that accounts for emerging social relations based on varying interaction behavior of collaboration partners. We describe the foundational concepts for dynamic social link management in Web-based collaborations. We highlight major concerns of computational models in highly dynamic networks and deal with temporal aspects such as supporting the emergence of relations, efficient update mechanisms, and aging of relations.","","978-0-7695-4381-9","10.1109/ICECCS.2011.34","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5773401","computational social network management;emergence of social relations;service-oriented crowdsourcing","Measurement;Humans;Collaboration;Social network services;Context;Software;Adaptation model","","","","29","IEEE","27 May 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In some applications such as Uber and Didi, drivers and passengers (i.e., users) submit locations to the server to match each other. However, the server may be untrusted and location privacy becomes a huge concern. Users expect to enjoy matching while protecting their locations and different users have different levels of location privacy. In this paper, we consider the personalized privacy-preserving online minimum bipartite matching problem. To solve this problem, we design a Personalized Quadtree-Based privacy-preserving matching Framework (PQBF). In this framework, we propose a privacy method using the truncated Geometric Mechanism on the quadTree (GMT). GMT allows users to intuitively select generalization regions with different sizes, which is user-friendly. We then formulate the distance on the quadtree using earth mover's distance (EMD) to select the closest worker-task pair. Considering the huge time overhead of distance calculation, we provide a way to accelerate. We show that our method satisfies $\epsilon$ - geo-indistinguishability on the quadtree and give the time complexity of PQBF. Experiments on synthetic data and real data show that our mechanism is more effective than previous mechanisms in terms of total distance. PQBF saves up to 35.9% total distance than a state-of-the-art algorithm.","","978-1-6654-7384-2","10.1109/BigCom57025.2022.00025","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10064452","Differential privacy;geo-indistinguishability;online minimum bipartite matching;geometric mechanism;quadtree","Earth;Crowdsourcing;Privacy;Big Data;Mobile handsets;Mobile applications;Servers","","","","52","IEEE","20 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

With the advancement of deep learning, methods based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have significantly improved pixel-level automatic classification accuracy in remote sensing image semantic segmentation. However, this progress relies on extensive, high-quality fine annotations, which are costly and time-consuming to acquire. To address these challenges, we propose utilizing easily accessible and cost-effective crowdsourced data from OpenStreetMap (OSM) to generate learning labels for network training. However, due to the open nature of crowdsourced data, the generated labels may contain noise interference, leading to decreased network performance during training. Meanwhile, supervised contrastive learning has shown strong potential in handling noisy labels, with previous research proposing selective contrastive learning strategies to address noisy labels in classification tasks. However, such research has been limited to classification, as segmentation poses memory explosion issues. To further tackle this problem, we introduce a semantic segmentation algorithm based on crowdsourced annotation and selective contrastive learning. The core idea involves selecting confident regions in the regional dimension, allowing pixel samples within these regions to participate in subsequent learning, thereby better capturing meaningful pixel features for classification while reducing sample quantity. By leveraging contrastive learning ofpaired features and selecting confident pairs from noise pairs for supervised contrastive learning, we enhance intra-class compactness, thereby improving network robustness and reducing noise interference. Experimental validation on the proposed crowdsourced semantic segmentation datasets demonstrates favorable outcomes.","","979-8-3503-6571-9","10.1109/ICGMRS62107.2024.10581219","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10581219","Remote sensing images;OSM;Noisy labels;Semantic segmentation","Training;Annotations;Semantic segmentation;Noise;Prototypes;Contrastive learning;Interference","","","","20","IEEE","9 Jul 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It is crucial that each freelancing task is assigned to the best suitable available worker since freelancing tasks are usually expensive and require domain knowledge. In this paper, we formalize the problem of the freelance task assignment as a multi objective optimization problem and proof that it is NP-hard. We propose a memetic based quality assurance task assignment algorithm that finds the most suitable top k-tasks for each worker in which the total quality of the crowdsourced output is maximized. The proposed memetic algorithm applies both differential evolution (DE) and Large Neighborhood Search (LNS) in a way to better make use of the exploration abilities of the differential evolution as a global search and the exploitation of the Large Neighborhood Search as a local search. The proposed memetic algorithm applies the differential evolution to find the best solution in each generation then the large neighborhood search (LNS) is used to search the neighborhood of that solution. Firstly, a list scheduling (LS) algorithm is used to convert the continuous vectors resulting from the differential evolution to the discrete vector that represent the initial solution to the large neighborhood search (LNS). Secondly, the exploration of the initial solution is done by the local search (LNS). The experiments are done using published standard test data from literature. The experimental results shows that the using a simple DE algorithm with the large neighborhood search as a local search yields the best performance.","","978-1-7281-6303-1","10.1109/CSDE48274.2019.9162396","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9162396","Memetic algorithm;Differential Evolution;Multi-objective Optimization","Task analysis;Optimization;Crowdsourcing;Memetics;Quality assurance;Linear programming;Information technology","","","","24","IEEE","7 Aug 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

LOD incorporates the core data sets in the Semantic Web, yet is not in full conformance with the guidelines for publishing high quality linked data on the Web. Our approach can help in enriching and improving quality of mission-critical links in LOD. Scalable LOD link management requires a hybrid approach, where human intelligent and machine intelligent tasks interleave in a workflow execution. Likewise, many other crowd sourcing applications require a sophisticated workflow specification not only on human intelligent tasks, but also machine intelligent tasks to handle data and control-flow, which is strictly deficient in the existing crowd sourcing platforms. Hence, we are strongly motivated to investigate the interplay of crowd sourcing, and semantically enriched workflows for better human-machine cooperation in task completion. We demonstrate usefulness of our approach through various link creation and verification tasks, and workflows using Amazon Mechanical Turk.
