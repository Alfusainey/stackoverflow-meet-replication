Two notable challenges of MCS are leakage of privacy and the challenge of malicious users, privacy-preserving reputation management scheme is an efficient method to tackle these challenges. However, most existing schemes rely on a semi-honest server and process data in plaintext domain without considering single point of failure and privacy of participants. In this paper we propose a reputation management scheme with blockchain to identify malicious users and protect users’ privacy simultaneously in MCS scenario. The secure and open nature of blockchain are exploited to build a dependable and efficient reputation management platform. Moreover, we adopt a distributed computing algorithm, Eigentrust, to construct a distributed reputation management framework, nevertheless, it neglects to preserve users’ privacy. So we leverage a verifiable secret sharing scheme into Eigentrust algorithm, which can prevent users’ personal information from being disclosed. The extensive analysis and experiments performed on EOS blockchain demonstrate that our system can effectively identify malicious users while preserving privacy.","2155-5494","978-1-7281-6630-8","10.1109/SECON48991.2020.9158420","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9158420","Privacy-preserving;reputation management;Eigentrust;mobile crowdsensing;blockchain","Sensors;Servers;Privacy;Task analysis;Encryption","","9","","23","IEEE","4 Aug 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Cultural differences affect the expression and perception of NVC but no previous automatic system considers these cultural differences. Annotation data for the LILiR TwoTalk corpus, containing dyadic (two person) conversations, was gathered using Internet crowdsourcing, with a significant quantity collected from India, Kenya and the United Kingdom (UK). Many studies have investigated cultural differences based on human observations but this has not been addressed in the context of automatic emotion or NVC recognition. Perhaps not surprisingly, testing an automatic system on data that is not culturally representative of the training data is seen to result in low performance. We address this problem by training and testing our system on a specific culture to enable better modeling of the cultural differences in NVC perception. The system uses linear predictor tracking, with features generated based on distances between pairs of trackers. The annotations indicated the strength of the NVC which enables the use of v-SVR to perform the regression.","","978-1-4673-0063-6","10.1109/ICCVW.2011.6130393","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6130393","","","","9","","24","IEEE","16 Jan 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Results in cognitive science suggest that people perform approximately Bayes-optimal decision making but that cognitive limitations require the coarse categorization of ensembles of problems rather than the application of optimal decision rules on a problem-by-problem basis. These observations motivate the development of a mathematical theory for Bayesian hypothesis testing with quantized prior information. This paper reviews recent results in minimum Bayes risk quantizer design and its economic implications. In the context of individual decision making, the theory explains differentials in false alarm and missed detection error rates for majority and minority subpopulations without appealing to a taste for discrimination. In group decision making by majority vote, quantizer design becomes a strategic form game. Nash equilibria are guaranteed to exist but often are not Pareto optimal. The analysis reveals precise senses in which a team of agents performs best when it is diverse and shares common goals. Finally, the implications of the theory for crowdsourcing are discussed.","","978-1-4577-0361-4","10.1109/ITA.2011.5743615","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5743615","","Games;Nash equilibrium;Quantization;Economics;Biological system modeling;Error probability","","9","","59","IEEE","7 Apr 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Similar to device-based localization, the initial phase in DFL is to build the fingerprint database which is usually done manually using site surveying. This process is tedious, time-consuming, and vulnerable to environmental dynamics. Motivated by the recent advances in the Internet of Things (IoT), this paper introduces RadioGrapher; a system that automates the process of device-free fingerprint calibration in IoT environments. RadioGrapher leverages the device-based locations of entities in the area of interest in a crowd-sensing manner, aided with Fresnel zones of the wirelessly connected IoT devices to automatically construct a device-free fingerprint. Experimental evaluation of RadioGrapher in an IoT testbed using multiple entities shows that it can construct DFL fingerprints with high accuracy. Moreover, its median localization accuracy is comparable to that of manual fingerprinting. This comes with no calibration overhead, highlighting the promise of RadioGrapher as a crowdsourcing device-free fingerprint constructor in IoT environments.","2576-6813","978-1-5386-4727-1","10.1109/GLOCOM.2018.8648111","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8648111","","Radiography;Calibration;Fresnel reflection;Detectors;Manuals;Wireless fidelity;Microprocessors","","9","","27","IEEE","21 Feb 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This pattern has overwhelmed the emergency services with limited resources and demands the optimization of response processes. It is partly due to traditional `reactive' approach of emergency services to collect data about incidents, where a source initiates a call to the emergency number (e.g., 911 in U.S.), delaying and limiting the potentially optimal response. Crowdsourcing platforms such as Waze provides an opportunity to develop a rapid, `proactive' approach to collect data about incidents through crowd-generated observational reports. However, the reliability of reporting sources and spatio-temporal uncertainty of the reported incidents challenge the design of such a proactive approach. Thus, this paper presents a novel method for emergency incident detection using noisy crowdsourced Waze data. We propose a principled computational framework based on Bayesian theory to model the uncertainty in the reliability of crowd-generated reports and their integration across space and time to detect incidents. Extensive experiments using data collected from Waze and the official reported incidents in Nashville, Tenessee in the U.S. show our method can outperform strong baselines for both Fl-score and AUC. The application of this work provides an extensible framework to incorporate different noisy data sources for proactive incident detection to improve and optimize emergency response operations in our communities.","","978-1-6654-1924-6","10.1109/WIIAT50758.2020.00029","National Science Foundation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9457694","Emergency Informatics;Bayesian Theory;Information Fusion;User-generated Content;Uncertainty","Crowdsourcing;Uncertainty;Systematics;Roads;Reliability theory;Emergency services;Reliability engineering","","8","","13","USGov","24 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, energy consumption and device battery lifetime are also important parameters that severely impact end-user QoE. In this context, this paper proposes a QoE-aware Energy-saving Device-Oriented Adaptive Scheme (E2DOAS) for mobile multimedia delivery over wireless networks. E2DOAS is a solution which optimizes the trade-off between the end-user perceived quality of the multimedia delivery and the mobile device energy-saving. This trade-off is used in order to adapt the multimedia application delivery to the underlying wireless network conditions and multi-device characteristics. A crowdsourcing-based subjective video quality assessment was setup to model a non-reference perceptual video quality function. The performance of E2DOAS was evaluated against other adaptive schemes via network simulations in a wireless LAN single cell environment, in terms of energy savings, end-user perceived quality, average throughput, and packet loss.","","978-1-4673-7131-5","10.1109/INFCOMW.2015.7179425","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7179425","Quality of Experience;Energy Saving;Adaptive Multimedia;Wireless Networks;Optimization","Streaming media;Mobile handsets;Batteries;Multimedia communication;Quality assessment;Video recording;Mobile communication","","8","","13","IEEE","6 Aug 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

But in reality, customers are unwilling to take part in the learning process unless they are compensated for their time and effort consequently, it is critical to figure out how to get customers involved in federated learning by motivating them successfully. Other areas like crowdsourcing, cloud computing, smart grid, etc. are simpler than designing an incentive structure for federated learning. To begin, it's impossible to determine the exact worth of the training data collected from each individual client. Second, different federated learning algorithms' learning performance is challenging to model. This work examines the design of a federated learning incentive system.

One WiFi fingerprint comprises multiple RSS values annotated with the location (reference point) where the signals are obtained. The positioning accuracy of WiFi RSS fingerprinting-based indoor positioning systems is highly reliant on the data volume of the observed signals. However, taking such data in a large complex indoor area is usually time-consuming and labor-intensive. In recent years, crowdsourcing approaches have been proposed to collect WiFi data and record the location by utilizing the trajectories of common users to reduce the burden of constructing the database. Nevertheless, crowdsourced data is usually sensitive to crowd density. The data coverage is usually not enough to cover the entire targeted environment to provide good positioning accuracy, particularly at the beginning stage of constructing a database. Besides, it is also expected that some regions do not have enough fingerprints to provide good positioning performance since they do not have as many visitors as others. Therefore, this paper proposes a WiFi fingerprint augmentation method to generate more fingerprints by predicting RSS values on unsurveyed locations through a multivariate Gaussian process regression (MGPR) model. Evaluations are conducted on an open-source crowdsourced WiFi fingerprint dataset collected in an actual multi-floor university building. The experiment results show that the proposed WiFi fingerprint augmentation method can enhance the global data coverage (considering the entire building) to reduce the positioning error by 5% to 20%. Also, the proposed method can sharply reduce the positioning error in some indoor regions by improving local data density (considering a 2D region on a certain floor).","2471-917X","978-1-7281-6218-8","10.1109/IPIN54987.2022.9918117","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9918117","Indoor positioning;WiFi fingerprinting;machine learning;augmentation","Training;Solid modeling;Databases;Buildings;Fingerprint recognition;Predictive models;Prediction algorithms","","8","","22","IEEE","26 Oct 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

One important challenge we address is how to achieve reliable event detection, as the information collected from the human crowd is typically noisy and users may have biases in the answers they provide.

In this paper we propose, develop, and evaluate the design of a crowdsourcing platform, called Loki, that is privacy conscious. Our contributions are three-fold: (a) We propose Loki, a system that allows users to obfuscate their (ratings-based or multiple-choice) responses at-source based on their chosen privacy level, and gives surveyors aggregated population averages with known statistical confidence. (b) We develop a novel selection mechanism, which the platform can use to give surveyors accurate population estimates within a cost budget, while ensuring fairness in privacy loss amongst users. (c) We evaluate our scheme both off-line using a large dataset of movie ratings, and on-line via experimentation with 131 real users using a prototype implementation on mobile devices.

That is because of a conflict between the logic of the crowds and the logic of policymaking. The crowd's logic differs from that of traditional policymaking in several aspects. To mention some of those: In traditional policymaking it is a small group of experts making proposals to the policy, whereas in crowdsourced policymaking, it is a large, anonymous crowd with a mixed level of expertise. The crowd proposes atomic ideas, whereas traditional policymaking is used to dealing with holistic and synthesized proposals. By drawing on data from a crowdsourced law-making process in Finland, the paper shows how the logics of the crowds and policymaking collide in practice. The conflict prevents policymaking fully benefiting from the crowd's input, and it also hinders governments from adopting crowdsourcing more widely as a practice for deploying open government principles.","1530-1605","978-0-7695-5670-3","10.1109/HICSS.2016.349","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7427532","crowdsourcing;crowdlaw;open policy;policymaking;legislation;open government;participatory democracy;open democracy;deliberative democracy;digital democracy;e-government","Crowdsourcing;Public policy;Safety;Production;Encoding","","8","","40","IEEE","10 Mar 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We demonstrate this claim by analyzing four social computing datasets that are rated by crowd workers, showing that the agreement ratings are low despite deploying proper instructions and platform settings. Findings indicate that the more subjective the rating task, the lower the agreement, suggesting that tasks differ by their inherent subjectivity and that measuring the agreement of social computing tasks might not be the optimal way to ensure data quality. When creating subjective tasks, the use of agreement metrics potentially gives a false picture of the consistency of crowd workers, as they over-simplify the reality of obtaining quality labels. We also provide empirical evidence on the stability of crowd ratings with a different number of raters, items, and categories, finding that the reliability scores are most sensitive to the number categories, somewhat less sensitive to the number of raters, and the least sensitive to the number of items.

However, the annotations collected this way are prone to human errors due to the lack of expertise of the crowd workers. Existing literature in annotation aggregation assumes that annotations are independent and thus faces challenges when handling the sequential label aggregation tasks with complex dependencies. To conquer the challenges, we propose an optimization-based method that infers the ground truth labels using annotations provided by workers for sequential labeling tasks. The proposed Aggregation method for Sequential Labels from Crowds (AggSLC) jointly considers the characteristics of sequential labeling tasks, workers’ reliabilities, and advanced machine learning techniques. Theoretical analysis on the algorithm’s convergence further demonstrates that the proposed AggSLC halts after a finite number of iterations. We evaluate AggSLC on different crowdsourced datasets for Named Entity Recognition (NER) tasks and Information Extraction tasks in biomedical (PICO), as well as a simulated dataset. Our results show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art aggregation methods.

In these tasks, motivating workers to provide their truthful opinions is a challenging problem. Most existing incentive mechanisms proposed to address this problem assume that workers share a common prior. However, this assumption is not always valid in practice, resulting in that the existing approaches may discourage workers to provide their truthful opinions. In this paper, we propose a novel incentive mechanism -- iMET -- to elicit truthful opinions for crowdsourced multiple-choice consensus tasks. By incorporating the concepts of worker credibility and similarity, iMET rewards workers for providing truthful opinions without assuming a common prior. Through extensive simulations on the basis of a collected real-world dataset, iMET has been demonstrated to outperform another two widely used incentive mechanisms in eliciting truthful opinions, especially when diverse truthful opinions are held by workers.","","978-1-4673-9618-9","10.1109/WI-IAT.2015.46","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7397343","incentive mechanism;truthful;crowdsourcing;consensus tasks","Crowdsourcing;Prediction methods;Bayes methods;Intelligent agents;Senior citizens;Computers","","7","","15","IEEE","4 Feb 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Game-theoretic applications also include settings such as crowdsourcing contests and question-and-answer forums. In an algorithmic context, where substitutes capture diminishing marginal improvement of information to an optimization problem, substitutes imply efficient approximation algorithms for a very general class of (adaptive) information acquisition problems. In tandem with these broad applications, we examine the structure and design of informational substitutes and complements. They have equivalent, intuitive definitions from disparate perspectives: submodularity, geometry, and information theory. We also consider the design of scoring rules or optimization problems so as to encourage substitutability or complementarity, with positive and negative results.

SCUs are collaborative units, and have a cloud-like behavior in the sense that they are elastically provisioned and adapted at runtime. Systems that utilize the concept of SCUs bring challenges that are associated with the highly dynamic and unpredictable human-centric behavior. Thus, trust in human based services is of paramount importance. While there is related work on social trust in the social networking and crowdsourcing areas, trust in highly coordinated constructs such as SCUs remains a significant challenge.

However, manual image annotation, even for creating the training sets, is time-consuming, complicated and contains human subjectivity errors. Thus, alternative ways for automatically creating training examples, i.e., pairs of images and tags, are crucial. As we showed in one of our previous studies, tags accompanying photos in social media and especially the Instagram hashtags can be used for image annotation. However, it turned out that only a 20% of the Instagram hashtags are actually relevant to the content of the image they accompany. Identifying those hashtags through crowdsourcing is a plausible solution. In this work, we investigate the effectiveness of the HITS algorithm for identifying the right tags in a crowdsourced image tagging scenario. For this purpose, we create a bipartite graph in which the first type of nodes corresponds to the annotators and the second type to the tags they select, among the hashtags, to annotate a particular Instagram image. From the results, we conclude that the authority value of the HITS algorithm provides an accurate estimation of the appropriateness of each Instagram hashtag to be used as a tag for the image it accompanies while the hub value can be used to filter out the dishonest annotators.","","978-1-5386-1956-8","10.1109/DASC-PICom-DataCom-CyberSciTec.2017.29","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8328372","Instagram;hashtags;image tagging;image retrieval;machine learning;HITS algorithm;graphs;bipartite network","Tagging;Twitter;Image annotation;Training;Visualization;Crowdsourcing","","7","","23","IEEE","2 Apr 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Our experiments reveal that while the on-board temperature sensors have great potential, using them for large scale data collection still requires significant work.","2155-2509","978-1-4799-8439-8","10.1109/COMSNETS.2015.7098674","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7098674","","Meteorology;Heating","","7","","24","IEEE","4 May 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Machine learning and Natural language processing approaches have been applied to elicit these technical tweets. Particularly, when learning techniques are considered, the success rate of the preprocessing process to overcome shortcomings in analyzing tweets becomes crucial. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a method which involves more than 6000 experiments in order to systematically analyze the effects of eleven preprocessing techniques on the classification performance of requirements-related tweets.

In doing so, these systems go through continuous assessment of their context and configure themselves accordingly to keep user satisfaction high. A popular approach to design adaptive software systems is to perform variability modelling, for instance adopting a feature-based approach. Features describe key components and characteristics of a system, which can take different values and be combined in different ways to obtain a system behavior that can best satisfy the needs of different users, who may use the software in different contexts. These design-time models should be complemented by rules that help in deciding when to switch from one valid system configuration to a different one to fit changing user needs or preferences. Eliciting information necessary to build suitable feature models, as well as rules for dynamic reconfigurations that cover relevant scenarios is not an easy task when considering dynamic adaptation in presence of high variability in user profiles. We are experiencing this issue in a project which aims at developing dynamically personalisable software, and specifically a dynamically configurable feedback gathering tool. In this vision paper we propose to use crowdsourcing to elicit knowledge about reconfiguration requirements for dynamically adaptive systems. The proposed approach rests on a two-stage process, which involves the contribution from the crowd of potential system users, as well as from domain experts.","","978-1-5386-3488-2","10.1109/REW.2017.74","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8054849","CrowdRE;requirement elicitation;software configuration;feature-base approach","Software;Crowdsourcing;Tools;Adaptation models;Monitoring;Adaptive systems;Data models","","7","","32","IEEE","2 Oct 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper proposes a generic participatory sensing framework that consists of a set of well-defined modules in support of diverse use cases. This framework incorporates a concept of “human-as-a-sensor” into participatory sensing and allows the public crowd to contribute human observations as well as sensor measurements from their mobile devices. We specifically address two issues: incentive and extensibility, where the former refers to motivating participants to contribute high-quality data while the latter refers to accommodating heterogeneous and uncertain data sources. To address the incentive issue, we design an incentive engine to attract high-quality contributed data independent of data modalities. This engine works together with a novel social network that we introduce into participatory sensing, where participants are linked together and interact with each other based on data quality and quantity they have contributed. To address the extensibility issue, the proposed framework embodies application-agnostic design and provides an interface to external datasets. To demonstrate and verify this framework, we have developed a prototype mobile application called imReporter, which crowdsources hybrid (image-text) reports from participants in an urban city, and incorporates an external dataset from a public data mall. A pilot study was also carried out with 15 participants for 3 consecutive weeks, and the result confirms that our proposed framework fulfills its design goals.","","978-1-4799-2843-9","10.1109/ISSNIP.2014.6827702","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6827702","Crowdsourcing;participatory sensing;pervasive computing;incentive mechanism;social network","Sensors;Global Positioning System;Engines;Educational Activities Board;Social network services;Mobile handsets;Atmospheric measurements","","7","","29","IEEE","9 Jun 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For such data preparation, a cascade of crowdsourced tasks are performed, which begins with bounding box annotations on all faces contained in images and videos, followed by identification of the labelled person of interest in such imagery, and, finally, landmark annotation of key facial fiducial points.

Despite its success, many HC projects struggle to expand their user base and create sustained user engagement. In contrast, the commercial video game industry overall is very successful at encouraging users to spend significant time and resources to play over extended stretches of time, using techniques such as gameplay loops to engage players on many levels. When integrating scientific research into a video game, ideally the HC activities fit naturally within the gameplay loops and overall game themes, which game developers are best suited to accomplish. The authors propose a new HC to Video Games (HCtVG) model and associated framework, which provides a common means to connect HC research and video game developers. The HCtVG model comprises two major phases: Deconstruction and Analysis (DA) done by the researchers, and Game Integration (GI) completed by the game developers. During the DA, researchers deconstruct their research into a 5-Step Analysis Structure (5SAS) consisting of Suggest, Validate, Process, Select, and Exit steps. The 5SAS allows game developers to perform the GI phase, using the guidelines provided to integrate the HC activity into the gameplay and theme. This structure allows scientists to focus on their domain expertise while leveraging the skills of the game development community to design their video game integration. To demonstrate the HCtVG model, the authors apply the DA phase to an HC project seeking the discovery of chemotherapeutic co-medication properties for multi-drug resistant cancer research, and use the GI phase to design and integrate the HC activity into the popular game Minecraft.","2573-3060","978-1-5386-6298-4","10.1109/SeGAH.2018.8401316","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8401316","Human computer interaction;Big data applications;Game design;Serious games;Human computing","Games;Computational modeling;Analytical models;Guidelines;Cancer;Tools;Crowdsourcing","","6","","46","IEEE","2 Jul 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Compared to professional video producers and broadcasters, these new generation broadcasters are highly heterogenous in terms of the network/system configurations and therefore the generated video quality, which calls for massive encoding and transcoding in order to unify the video sources and serve multiple quality versions to viewers with different configurations. On the other hand, with the rapid evolution in the hardware industry, high performance processors (e.g., Intel Core i7-4790K CPU) become mainstream in personal computer market. More end devices can easily transcode high quality videos in realtime. We witness huge computational resource among the massive fellow viewers that could potentially be used for transcoding. In this paper, inspired by fog computing, we propose Crowd-Transcoding, a novel framework for CLS systems that offloads the transcoding assignment to the massive viewers. We identify that the key challenges in CrowdTranscoding are to detect qualified stable viewers and to properly assign them to the source channels. We put forward Viewer Crowdsourcing Transcode Scheduler (VCTS) to smartly schedule the workload assignment. Our solution has been evaluated under diverse viewer/channel conditions as well as different parameter settings. The trace-driven simulation confirms the superiority of CrowdTranscoder, while our PlanetLab-based and real world end-viewer experiments show the practical performance of our approach, which also give hint to the further enhancement.","2159-6190","978-1-5090-2619-7","10.1109/CLOUD.2016.0025","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7820262","CrowdTranscoding;Crowdsourced Live Streaming","Streaming media;Transcoding;TV;Cloud computing;Games;YouTube;Bandwidth","","6","","27","IEEE","19 Jan 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

First, a zero-effort fingerprint automated construction and site survey update scheme is proposed with the dual-frequency RFID. Second, in order to solve the problem that step length would vary from person to person which results into positioning bias, the RSS technology and floor map is introduced to aid step length estimation. Third, the particle filter is adopted to fuse the advantages of three different technologies to conduct the accurate indoor positioning. In the experiment, the obtained fingerprint database is demonstrated to possess a comparable accuracy with the human-annotated database.

Recent survey on preservation of heritage shows demand for the digitization and conservations of heritage sites owing to their susceptibility to natural disasters and human acts. Digital conservation can be facilitated via crowdsourcing of data useful for construction of 3D models. Data from multiple sites sourced may result in elimination of relevant images due to the limitations of the pipeline. Curation and categorization of the crowd-sourced data enables better 3D reconstruction. 3D reconstruction pipelines demand correlation between the data and also tries to eliminate the irrelevant information. The reconstruction pipeline is sensitive to selection of initial pair for reconstruction. By categorising individual sites, crowdsourced data can be used to create better 3D reconstructed models. Categorization of crowdsourced data demands learning robust representations of data. Towards this, we propose DA-AE for improved representation and categorization of data in latent space, along with a disparity alleviation loss. We demonstrate categorization as an event, with clustering as a downstream task. We compare our results of clustering with state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets (MNIST, FashionMNIST, and USPS).

Then, as a first step towards combating misinformation in data stories, we explore possible defensive design methods to enhance the reader's awareness of information misalignment when data facts are scripted and visualized. More specifically, we conduct a between-subjects crowdsourcing study to investigate the impact of two design methods enhancing text-visualization integration, i.e., explanatory annotation and interactive linking, on users' awareness of misinformation in data stories.

Such a fine-grained vulnerability map identifies early on high-risk areas, helping to reduce the spread of the disease. To mitigate data bias from each self-reporting app, an adaptive worker selection algorithm that leverages neighbouring datasets to obtain a balanced data distribution is proposed.

This paper focuses on measurement point collocation in different cases and their effects on localization accuracy. We first study two simple preliminary cases under assumption that users are uniformly distributed: when measurement points are collocated regularly, we propose a collocation pattern which is most beneficial to localization accuracy; when measurement points are collocated randomly, we prove that localization accuracy is limited by a tight bound. Under the general case that users are distributed asymmetrically, we show the best allocation scheme of measurement points: measurement point density ρ is proportional to (cμ)2/3 in every part of the region, where μ is user density and c is a constant determined by the collocation pattern.

We compare the results and times required to those of the adaptive binary search type approach, in which image pairs with distortions that bracket the PJND are displayed and the difference in distortion levels is reduced until the PJND is identified. For the three methods, two images are compared using the flicker test in which the displayed images alternate at a frequency of 8 Hz. Unlike previous work, our goal is a global one, determining the PJND not only for the original pristine image but also for a sequence of compressed versions. Results for the MCL-JCI dataset show that the PJND measurements based on adjustment are comparable with those of the traditional approach using binary search, yet significantly faster.

Unfortunately, the traditional approach to receiving incident reports (e.g., calling 911 in the USA) has time delays. Crowdsourcing platforms such as Waze provide an opportunity for early identification of incidents. However, detecting incidents from crowdsourced data streams is difficult due to the challenges of noise and uncertainty associated with such data. Further, simply optimizing over detection accuracy can compromise spatial-temporal localization of the inference, thereby making such approaches infeasible for real-world deployment. This paper presents a novel problem formulation and solution approach for practitioner-centered incident detection using crowdsourced data by using emergency response management as a case-study. The proposed approach CROME (Crowdsourced Multi-objective Event Detection) quantifies the relationship between the performance metrics of incident classification (e.g., F1 score) and the requirements of model practitioners (e.g., 1 km. radius for incident detection). First, we show how crowdsourced reports, ground-truth historical data, and other relevant determinants such as traffic and weather can be used together in a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture for early detection of emergency incidents. Then, we use a Pareto optimization-based approach to optimize the output of the CNN in tandem with practitioner-centric parameters to balance detection accuracy and spatial-temporal localization. Finally, we demonstrate the applicability of this approach using crowdsourced data from Waze and traffic accident reports from Nashville, TN, USA. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms existing approaches in incident detection while simultaneously optimizing the needs for real-world deployment and usability.","2374-8486","978-1-6654-2398-4","10.1109/ICDM51629.2021.00164","George Mason University; National Science Foundation; Tennessee Department of Transportation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9679106","Crowdsourcing;Emergency Response;Deep Learning;Waze;Multi-Objective Optimization","Location awareness;Uncertainty;Event detection;Pareto optimization;Emergency services;Convolutional neural networks;Data mining","","5","","10","IEEE","24 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Experimenters can easily access to a huge pool of human subjects through crowdsourcing platforms. A fundamental problem threatening the integrity of crowdtesting is to detect cheating from the workers who work without any supervision. One of the approaches in classifying the quality of workers is analyzing their behavior during the experiments. A major challenge is to systematically analyze the mouse cursor trajectory. However, existing works usually analyze the trajectory coarsely, which cannot fully extract the information imbedded in the trajectory. In this paper, we propose to use finer-grained cursor trajectory analysis, including submovement analysis, to identify low quality workers. Our approach is to define a set of ten worker behavior metrics to quantify different types of worker behavior. A jQuery-based library was implemented to collect the worker behavior. Moreover, four different 5-point Likert scale rating methods were employed. A number of methods, including question design, instructions, and human inspections, are used to label workers into three categories. We then apply multiclass Naive Bayes classifier to construct different models using all or some of the metrics and the workers' category. Our results show that the error rates of the model trained from four metrics is equal or less than 30% for four rating methods. By combining the predictions from the four rating methods, the successful rate in detecting low-quality workers is around 80%.","","978-1-4673-7113-1","10.1109/IWQoS.2015.7404734","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7404734","","Measurement;Trajectory;Mice;Quality of service;Crowdsourcing;Computational modeling;Data mining","","5","","27","IEEE","11 Feb 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This becomes a problem in large repositories of legacy code, since it is cost prohibitive to retroactively annotate summaries in dozens or hundreds of old programs. Likewise, it is a problem for creators of automatic documentation generation algorithms, since these algorithms usually must learn from large annotated datasets, which do not exist for many programming languages.

One of the research directions is the analysis of online information from the perspective of its credibility. This paper aims to assess and analyze the credibility of tweets in Arabic language. In order to achieve the stated goal, first we employ the idea of crowdsourcing where users can explicitly express their opinions about credibility of a set of tweets. This information coupled with the data about tweets' features enable us to investigate which features may indicate the credibility level of a tweet, e.g. tweet with attached image and was authored by a person who posts a lot of tweets will be, with high probability, a credible tweet. We distinguish three main groups of features: authority and topical expertise (of the source), data quality (of the content), and popularity (of the content and the source). We argue that content data quality factor based on content linguistic features in addition to source authority is more important than content popularity in identifying credible messages. In addition to this, we identified three experts who also rated the credibility of tweets and based on that we investigate the level of agreement between experts and the crowd, and we identify which expert represents the crowd in the best way. This can allow us to select the most representative expert when it is needed. This study is a pilot of a large study that aims at predicting credibility of Arabic Twitter messages using machine learning approaches.","","978-1-4503-3854-7","10.1145/2808797.2808819","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7403700","credibility;social networks;microblogs;Arabic;Twitter;trust","Twitter;Atmospheric measurements;Particle measurements;Pragmatics;Context;Tag clouds","","5","","24","","11 Feb 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we propose a novel privacy-preserving decentralized game-theoretic framework for resource crowdsourcing in MEC. Our framework models the interactions between a content provider (CP) and multiple mobile edge device users (MEDs) as a non-cooperative game, in which MEDs offer idle storage resources for content caching in exchange for rewards. We introduce efficient decentralized gradient play algorithms for Nash equilibrium (NE) computation by exchanging local information among neighboring MEDs only, thus preventing attackers from learning users' private information. The key challenge in designing such algorithms is that communication among MEDs is not fixed and is facilitated by a sequence of undirected time-varying graphs. Our approach achieves linear convergence to the NE without imposing any assumptions on the values of parameters in the local objective functions, such as requiring strong monotonicity to be stronger than its dependence on other MEDs' actions, which is commonly required in existing literature when the graph is directed time-varying. Extensive simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in achieving efficient resource outsourcing decisions while preserving the privacy of the edge devices.","2690-3342","978-3-903176-55-3","10.23919/WiOpt58741.2023.10349816","Institute for Computing, Information and Cognitive Systems (ICICS); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10349816","Mobile edge caching;time-varying communication graph;decentralized algorithm;non-cooperative game","Privacy;Multi-access edge computing;Wireless networks;Games;Nash equilibrium;User experience;Outsourcing","","5","","23","","22 Dec 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This dataset was collected by crawling over 100 websites—representative of the top 1 M websites in the Web—while crowdsourcing 6,000 user opinions on user perceived page load time (uPLT). We show that the uPLT distribution is often multi-modal and that, in practice, no more than three modes are present.

As new “fuzzy” measures are developed the research challenge is on how to evaluate them. Traditional approaches have involved rigorous and complex human involvement in compiling benchmark datasets and obtaining human similarity measures. Existing datasets often contain limited fuzzy words and do allow the fuzzy measures to be exhaustively tested. This paper presents an automatic method for the generation of a Multiple Fuzzy Word Dataset (MFWD) from a corpus. A Fuzzy Sentence Pairing Algorithm is used to extract and augment high, medium and low similarity sentence pairs with multiple fuzzy words.

Census records have a tabular structured layout. They consist in a sequence of rows with information of homes ordered by street address. For each household snippet in the page, the list of family members is reported. The censuses are recorded in intervals of a few years and the information of individuals in each household is quite stable from a point in time to the next one. This redundancy is used to assist the transcriber, so the redundant information is transferred from the census already transcribed to the next one. Household records are aligned from one year to the next one using the knowledge of the ordering by street address. Given an already transcribed census, a query by string word spotting is applied. Thus, names from the census in time t are used as queries in the corresponding home record in time t+1. Since the search is constrained, the obtained precision-recall values are very high, with an important reduction in the transcription time. The proposed system has been tested in a real citizen-science experience where non expert users transcribe the census data of their home town.","","978-1-5090-1792-8","10.1109/DAS.2016.47","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7490093","Historical Documents;Word Spotting;Systems for Digital Humanities;Crowsourcing transcription","Layout;Crowdsourcing;Urban areas;Context;Image segmentation;Text analysis","","5","","35","IEEE","13 Jun 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For example, preprocessing face images with Gabor band-pass filters is known to improve performance in expression recognition tasks [1]. Sometimes, however, one may wish to purposely decrease discriminability of one classification task (a “distractor” task), while simultaneously preserving information relevant to another task (the target task): For example, due to privacy concerns, it may be important to mask the identity of persons contained in face images before submitting them to a crowdsourcing site (e.g., Mechanical Turk) when labeling them for certain facial attributes. Suppressing discriminability in distractor tasks may also be needed to improve inter-dataset generalization: training datasets may sometimes contain spurious correlations between a target attribute (e.g., facial expression) and a distractor attribute (e.g., gender). We might improve generalization to new datasets by suppressing the signal related to the distractor task in the training dataset. This can be seen as a special form of supervised regularization. In this paper we present an approach to automatically learning preprocessing filters that suppress discriminability in distractor tasks while preserving it in target tasks. We present promising results in simulated image classification problems and in a realistic expression recognition problem.","1063-6919","978-1-4673-1228-8","10.1109/CVPR.2012.6247964","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6247964","","Face;Convolution;Vectors;Kernel;Training;Labeling;Measurement","","5","1","16","IEEE","26 Jul 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This metric incorporates activity coverage and activity uniformity to address two primary privacy threats, namely activity hotspot disclosure and activity transition disclosure. In addition, we propose an algorithm to minimize privacy exposure for mobile LBSs. We evaluate the proposed metric and the privacy-preserving sensing algorithm via extensive simulations. Moreover, we have also implemented the algorithm in an Android-based mobile system and conducted real-world experiments. Both our simulations and experimental results demonstrate that (1) the proposed metric can properly quantify the privacy exposure level of human activities in the spatial domain and (2) the proposed algorithm can effectively cloak users' activity hotspots and transitions at both high and low user-mobility levels.","","978-1-5090-1328-9","10.1109/GLOCOM.2016.7842319","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7842319","","Privacy;Mobile communication;IEEE 802.11 Standard;Smart phones;Measurement;Data privacy;Sensors","","5","","28","IEEE","6 Feb 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"Towards an Information System for Evidence-Based Analysis of Charging Behavior, Charging Demand, and Battery Degradation of Electric Vehicles","M. von Hoffen","Department of Information Systems, ERCIS, Münster, Germany",2016 IEEE 18th Conference on Business Informatics (CBI),"12 Dec 2016","2016","01","","182","190","Batteries in Electric Vehicles (EV) are subject to a degradation process that has many, yet not fully understood, influential factors. Typically, the battery is continuously monitored by a proprietary Battery Management System (BMS) which records and analyzes various key figures of the battery. Because the BMS is proprietary, the data collected throughout the lifetime of an EV and its battery cannot simply be looked into by the owner but only by the EV manufacturer and licensed service providers. Hence, the EV owner is dependent on the manufacturer to retrieve accurate data regarding the State of Health (SOH) of the battery, e.g. when selling the vehicle or when the battery needs replacement. An in-depth understanding of charging behavior and the degradation process of an EV's battery requires a vast amount of data, which is a crucial factor limiting current research. This paper proposes an information system that blends into the EV charging infrastructure and utilizes a crowdsourcing approach to collect charging transaction data. In order to identify concealed dependencies with regards to battery degradation and to identify patterns in the charging behavior, an enrichment of the raw transaction data is motivated and different information providers are discussed. This augmentation integrates environmental information from various sources such as weather and location data. On a macroscopic view, analyses could point out the correlation between weather, public events, location, and charging demand. On an individual basis, the effect of environmental impacts, charging behavior, and driving profile on battery degradation can be investigated and compared.","2378-1971","978-1-5090-3231-0","10.1109/CBI.2016.28","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7780313","Electric mobility;crowdsourced data;analytics;battery degradation;EV charging behavior;EV charging demand","Batteries;Degradation;Electric vehicles;Battery management systems;Data collection;Correlation","","5","","22","IEEE","12 Dec 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Fortunately, many user tasks are delay-tolerant, which offers the network users a favorable degree of freedom in waiting for and accessing the opportunistic resource at the time of its best quality. For such delay-tolerant and opportunistic resource sharing networks (DT-ORS-Net), the corresponding optimal accessing strategies developed in existing literature mainly focus on the single-user scenarios, while the potential competition from other peer users in practical multi-user DT-ORS-Net is often ignored. Considering this, a multi-player Markov stopping game (M-MSG) is developed in this work, and the derived Nash equilibrium (NE) strategy of this M-MSG can guide network users to properly handle the potential competition from other peers and thus exploit the time diversity of the opportunistic resource more effectively, which in turn further improves the resource utilization efficiency. Applications in the cloud-computing and the mobile crowdsourcing networks are demonstrated to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, and simulation results show that using the NE strategy of the proposed M-MSG can provide substantial performance gain as compared to using the conventional single-user optimal one.","","978-1-4673-9953-1","10.1109/INFOCOM.2016.7524350","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7524350","","Cloud computing;Games;Markov processes;Mobile communication;Mobile computing;Resource management;Crowdsourcing","","5","","24","IEEE","28 Jul 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For evaluation, we created a new dataset of 1,000 PowerPoint slides with visual clarity label by using a crowdsourcing service. Using the 30% of the slides with high/low clarity rating, we achieved an accurate classification rate of 90.3%. We further proposed a feedback system that supports the improvement of slide designs.

Many factors explain traffic accidents, such as the nature of the accident site, its environment, time, driver behavior, weather, and other uncertain complex factors. As a result, the occurrence of road accidents is non-linear, so it is necessary to explore the correlation between data from many different aspects to minimize the risk. After pre-processing the data and a classification using the data mining tools, relevant information can be deduced on the causes of the high-frequency accidents. Depending on the actual results obtained, we can verify the accuracy of the extracted information, and this can help predict new situations with similar data in the future. The ultimate aim of data analysis is to choose the most accurate extraction process after validation, by analyzing the characteristics of the data and their relationship to the analysis and extraction process. In this paper, we propose a decision-making system for the analysis of traffic accident data in order to extract information relevant to the prevention of road risk. In addition, we introduce the concept of crowdsourcing in the collection phase to gather more information from the users involved in an accident. The proposed system is based on appropriate data mining and Big Data techniques for the extraction, pre-processing and exploration of accident data, entirely managed by the Hadoop framework, in order to categorize road accidents and detect problematic sites.","","978-1-5386-9385-8","10.1109/SITIS.2018.00084","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8706197","big data, crowdsourcing, decision support system, data mining, data warehouse, Hadoop framework, road traffic accidents","Data mining;Roads;Data warehouses;Big Data;Road accidents;Decision making","","5","","20","IEEE","6 May 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The meta-data available in these pages can be analyzed to gain a better understanding of the content and quality of the articles. We discuss how the rich meta-data available in wiki pages can be used to provide better search results in Wikipedia. Built on the studies on ""Wisdom of Crowds"" and the effectiveness of the knowledge collected by a large number of people, we investigate the effect of incorporating the extent of review of an article in the quality of rankings of the search results. The extent of review is measured by the number of distinct editors contributed to the articles and is extracted by processing Wikipedia's history pages. We compare different ranking algorithms that explore combinations of text-relevancy, PageRank, and extent of review. The results show that the review-based ranking algorithm which combines the extent of review and text-relevancy outperforms the rest; it is more accurate and less computationally expensive compared to PageRank-based rankings.","","978-1-4244-4613-1","10.1109/CASoN.2009.14","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5176107","Wikipedia;Search;Ranking","Wikipedia;History;Social network services;Web pages;Search engines;Computer networks;Java;Informatics;Computer science;Web search","","5","","33","IEEE","31 Jul 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Building on the rich literature of threshold public goods and motivation theory, we investigate how different crowdfunding-like mechanisms for budget allocation affect contribution behaviour, user agency, and overall welfare. In a pilot experiment, we find that decisions on institutional budget allocation with no alternative use lead to higher overall welfare gains and more funded projects than an existing outside option (keeping budget for private use), whereas differences in subjects' perceived sense of agency were insignificant. This indicates that institutions can implement such a restricting mechanism without limiting user motivation, while maximizing welfare.","1530-1605","978-0-7695-5670-3","10.1109/HICSS.2016.351","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7427534","","Investment;Government;Standards;Resource management;Games;Buildings;Collaboration","","5","","30","IEEE","10 Mar 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We develop a computationally efficient randomized algorithm with theoretical performance guarantees to address this computational challenge.

The proposed architecture furthermore has two-fold benefits, minimizing the overall energy consumption and efficiently utilizing the available resources. In the context of energy constraints and dynamic nature of a mobile cloud, a job assignment problem is formulated and an algorithm is proposed to reach a priority based energy efficient solution. Simulations performed over several different scenarios using realistic energy consumption models, applicable for some of the commercially available mobile devices, favors practical implementation of the “Crowd-Cloud” concept.","","978-1-5090-2361-5","10.1109/NCC.2016.7561166","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7561166","","Sensors;Cloud computing;Mobile handsets;Mobile communication;Computer architecture;Crowdsourcing;Big data","","4","","20","IEEE","8 Sep 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Some forms of online service like crowdsourcing have drawn academic interests. However, confusions on the concepts and business models around this topic still exist; and little effort has been made for the improvement. In this paper, we identify and define five key business models of online service by positioning it in the vein of organizational practices. Then a research agenda is proposed. By doing this, we call academic attentions to this new phenomenon.","","978-1-4244-6581-1","10.1109/ICMSS.2011.5998714","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5998714","","Organizations;Technological innovation;Communities;Information systems;Programming;Context","","4","","20","IEEE","25 Aug 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
