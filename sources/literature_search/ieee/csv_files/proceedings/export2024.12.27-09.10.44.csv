Requesters can then easily determine whether the crowdsourced results are satisfactory, and workers will have a fairly clear expectation of the monetary reward once the task is accomplished. However, such a paradigm becomes problematic when it is applied to Object Identification (OI) tasks. First, for OI tasks, it is difficult for requesters to evaluate whether sufficient numbers of objects have been found by an individual worker, warranting payment. Second, the same objects can be detected by many workers and ending up being unnecessary workload and inefficient performance. In this paper, we design a new crowdsourcing paradigm for OI tasks. Designing such a paradigm is challenging. Firstly, an easily-detected object can be found by multiple workers, which leads to an unfair situation that the requester has to make extra payments for the duplication. Secondly, there is usually a time limit to finish the overall crowdsourcing process, which demands efficient assignment strategy. To address these challenges, we propose solutions to achieve fairness by a Pay-As-You-Go (PAYG) mechanism and efficiency by a new worker-assignment scheme, Adaptive Worker Assignment (AWA). Extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate the advantages of this new paradigm.","","978-1-4673-9005-7","10.1109/BigData.2016.7840650","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7840650","","Crowdsourcing;Approximation algorithms;Greedy algorithms;Optimization;Pragmatics;Probabilistic logic;Estimation","","","","25","IEEE","6 Feb 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The answers to general tasks are usually open and not constrained by multiple choices. For the general tasks, the worker performance prediction models can facilitate the task assignment process in crowdsourcing. Worker performance prediction is affected by the three roles: the worker, the requester, and the task. The existing worker performance prediction models mainly consider the features of tasks and workers. However, these models rarely consider the features of requesters. And the existing worker performance prediction models for multiple-choice tasks are not suitable for general tasks as they are built based on the workers' accuracy on choices. In this work, we propose a worker performance prediction model by taking account of features of workers, tasks, and requesters to help requesters select workers for their general tasks on crowdsourcing platforms. We design a relationship learning module to learn the low dimension relationship representations of workers, tasks, and requesters. Furthermore, we design a performance learning model to predict workers' performance based on the features and relationship representations of workers, tasks, and requesters. A set of experiments against the realworld dataset from the Zhubajie platform has been conducted.

Developer Question and Answer (Q&A) websites provide a large amount of security discussion.

Traditional supervised Machine Learning methods can automate the mining process; however, the required negative (non-security) class is too expensive to obtain. We propose a novel learning framework, PUMiner, to automatically mine security posts from Q&A websites. PUMiner builds a context-aware embedding model to extract features of the posts, and then develops a two-stage PU model to identify security content using the labelled Positive and Unlabelled posts. We evaluate PUMiner on more than 17.2 million posts on Stack Overflow and 52,611 posts on Security StackExchange. We show that PUMiner is effective with the validation performance of at least 0.85 across all model configurations. Moreover, Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) of PUMiner is 0.906, 0.534 and 0.084 points higher than one-class SVM, positive-similarity filtering, and one-stage PU models on unseen testing posts, respectively. PUMiner also performs well with an MCC of 0.745 for scenarios where string matching totally fails. Even when the ratio of the labelled positive posts to the unlabelled ones is only 1:100, PUMiner still achieves a strong MCC of 0.65, which is 160% better than fully-supervised learning. Using PUMiner, we provide the largest and up-to-date security content on Q&A websites for practitioners and researchers.","2574-3864","978-1-4503-7517-7","10.1145/3379597.3387443","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10148721","Mining Software Repositories;Positive Unlabelled Learning;Machine Learning;Natural Language Processing;Software Security","Support vector machines;Correlation coefficient;Filtering;Machine learning;Feature extraction;Software;Security","","8","","80","","20 Jun 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Existing approaches usually focus on the matching of two types of objects, tasks and workers, or assume the static offline scenarios, where the spatio-temporal information of all the tasks and workers is known in advance. Recently, some new emerging O2O applications incur new challenges: SC platforms need to assign three types of objects, tasks, workers and workplaces, and support dynamic real-time online scenarios, where the existing solutions cannot handle. In this paper, based on the aforementioned challenges, we formally define a novel dynamic online task assignment problem, called the trichromatic online matching in real-time spatial crowdsourcing (TOM) problem, which is proven to be NP-hard. Thus, we first devise an efficient greedy online algorithm. However, the greedy algorithm can be trapped into local optimal solutions easily. We then present a threshold-based randomized algorithm that not only guarantees a tighter competitive ratio but also includes an adaptive optimization technique, which can quickly learn the optimal threshold for the randomized algorithm. Finally, we verify the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed methods through extensive experiments on real and synthetic datasets.","2375-026X","978-1-5090-6543-1","10.1109/ICDE.2017.147","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7930043","","Employment;Real-time systems;Crowdsourcing;Algorithm design and analysis;Heuristic algorithms;Optimization;Bipartite graph","","88","","39","IEEE","18 May 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Because these low-paid workers can be unreliable, nearly all crowdsourcers must devise schemes to increase confidence in their answers, typically by assigning each task multiple times and combining the answers in some way such as majority voting. In this paper, we consider a model of such crowdsourcing tasks and pose the problem of minimizing the total price (i.e., number of task assignments) that must be paid to achieve a target overall reliability. We give a new algorithm for deciding which tasks to assign to which workers and for inferring correct answers from the workers' answers.

This method of data collection can significantly reduce cost and turnover time, and is particularly useful in environmental sensing, where traditional means fail to provide fine-grained field data. In this study, we introduce hyperlocal spatial crowdsourcing, where all workers who are located within the spatiotemporal vicinity of a task are eligible to perform the task, e.g., reporting the precipitation level at their area and time. In this setting, there is often a budget constraint, either for every time period or for the entire campaign, on the number of workers to activate to perform tasks. The challenge is thus to maximize the number of assigned tasks under the budget constraint, despite the dynamic arrivals of workers and tasks as well as their co-location relationship. We study two problem variants in this paper: budget is constrained for every timestamp, i.e. fixed, and budget is constrained for the entire campaign, i.e. dynamic. For each variant, we study the complexity of its offline version and then propose several heuristics for the online version which exploit the spatial and temporal knowledge acquired over time. Extensive experiments with real-world and synthetic datasets show the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed solutions.","","978-1-4673-8779-8","10.1109/PERCOM.2016.7456507","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7456507","Crowdsourcing;Spatial Crowdsourcing;Mobile Crowdsensing;Online Task Assignment;Budget Constraints","Crowdsourcing;Sensors;Spatiotemporal phenomena;Meteorology;Real-time systems;Data collection;Mobile communication","","69","","21","IEEE","21 Apr 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

With mobile social networking, a user enjoys an intrinsic benefit when she aligns her behavior with the behavior of others. Referred to as network effects, such an intrinsic benefit becomes more significant as the number of users grows in the crowdsourcing system. But should a crowdsourcer design her extrinsic rewards differently when such network effects are taken into account? In this paper, we, for the first time, consider network effects as a contributing factor to intrinsic rewards, and study its influence on the design of extrinsic rewards. Rather than assuming a fixed participant population, we show that the number of participating users evolves to a steady equilibrium, thanks to subtle interactions between intrinsic rewards due to network effects and extrinsic rewards offered by the crowdsourcer. Taken network effects into consideration, we design progressively more sophisticated extrinsic reward mechanisms, and propose new and optimal strategies for a crowdsourcer to obtain a higher utility. Via extensive simulations, we demonstrate that with our new strategies, a crowdsourcer is able to attract more participants with higher contributed efforts; and participants gain higher utilities from both intrinsic and extrinsic rewards.","","978-1-4673-9953-1","10.1109/INFOCOM.2016.7524546","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7524546","","Crowdsourcing;Sociology;Statistics;Computers;Mobile communication;Games;Conferences","","65","","24","IEEE","28 Jul 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We are inspired by the conduciveness of Tullock contests to attracting user entry (yet not necessarily a higher revenue) in other domains. In this paper, we explore a new dimension in optimal Tullock contest design, by superseding the contest prize - which is fixed in conventional Tullock contests - with a prize function that is dependent on the (unknown) winner's contribution, in order to maximize the crowdsourcer's utility. We show that this approach leads to attractive practical advantages: (a) it is well-suited for rapid prototyping in fully distributed web agents and smartphone apps; (b) it overcomes the disincentive to participate caused by players' antagonism to an increasing number of rivals. Furthermore, we optimize conventional, fixed-prize Tullock contests to construct the most superior benchmark to compare against our mechanism. Through extensive evaluations, we show that our mechanism significantly outperforms the optimal benchmark, by over three folds on the crowdsourcer's utility cum profit and up to nine folds on the players' social welfare.","0743-166X","978-1-4799-8381-0","10.1109/INFOCOM.2015.7218641","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7218641","","Crowdsourcing;Benchmark testing;Bayes methods;Computers;Cost accounting;Conferences;Games","","61","","32","IEEE","24 Aug 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To preserve the driver's privacy, in this paper, we propose a privacy-preserving real-time navigation system (PRIN) using vehicular crowdsourcing. In PRIN, the RSUs cooperatively find an optimal path for the querying vehicle to the destination according to the real-time traffic information crowdsourced by the vehicles in their coverage areas. The querying vehicle retrieves the navigation result from each RSU successively when entering its coverage area, and follows the proper driving route to the next RSU, until reaching its destination. During these querying, crowdsourcing and retrieving processes, the driver's personal information, such as location, identity, is protected from being disclosed to attackers. In addition, a trusted authority can trace the drivers' identities if they upload false traffic information. Finally, we discuss the properties of conditional privacy preservation and demonstrate the efficiency of PRIN.","","978-1-5090-1701-0","10.1109/VTCFall.2016.7881177","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7881177","","Navigation;Vehicles;Real-time systems;Crowdsourcing;Privacy;Roads;Security","","53","","18","IEEE","20 Mar 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Task assignment plays an important role in offering high-quality services.

As a result, they cannot handle some real world scenarios which require minimizing the maximum delay in task assignment. In this paper, we study the minimizing maximum delay spatial crowdsourcing (MMD-SC) problem and propose solutions aiming at achieving a worst case controlled task assignment. The MMD-SC problem assumes that both workers and requesters come dynamically and considers not only the workers' travel costs but also the buffering time of tasks, thus it is very challenging due to two-sided online setting. To address these challenges, in this work, we propose a space embedding based online random algorithm with a competitive ratio of O(log n) and two efficient heuristic algorithms, namely the threshold based greedy approach and the batch-based approach. In addition, we demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our methods via extensive experiments on both synthetic and real datasets.","2375-026X","978-1-5386-7474-1","10.1109/ICDE.2019.00131","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8731538","spatial crowdsourcing;online matching;task assignment","Task analysis;Delays;Crowdsourcing;Space exploration;Public transportation;Servers;Extraterrestrial measurements","","46","","45","IEEE","6 Jun 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Since the bandwidth and storage resources in DTN are very limited and not enough to deliver all the crowdsourced photos, it is important to prioritize more valuable photos to use the limited resources.

A typical topic of spatial crowdsourcing is task assignment, which assigns crowd workers to users’ requests in real time and maximizes the total revenue. However, it is common that the available crowd workers over a platform are too far away to serve the requests, so some user requests may be rejected or responded at high money cost after long waiting. Fortunately, the neighbors of a platform usually have available resources for the same services. Collaboratively conducting the task allocation among different platforms can greatly improve the quality of services, but have not been investigated yet. In this paper, we propose a Cross Online Matching (COM), which enables a platform to ""borrow"" unoccupied crowd workers from other platforms for completing the user requests. We propose two algorithms, deterministic cross online matching (DemCOM) and randomized cross online matching (RamCom) for COM. DemCOM focuses on the largest obtained revenue in a greedy manner, while RamCom considers the trade-off between the obtained revenue and the probability of request being accepted by the borrowed workers.

We formulate a utility maximization problem to tackle this difficulty, and propose a novel crowdsourcing framework, involving a number of participating clients with local training data to leverage FL.

Cost of such large-scale sensor deployment can be reduced via crowdsourcing, i.e., outsourcing the sensing task to mobile users equipped with sensorized high-end client devices (e.g., tablets or smartphones), and success of such crowdsourced sensing presumes some incentive mechanisms to attract user participation. In this work, we present an incentivized crowdsourcing system architecture that (periodically) acquires spectrum data from users, so as to optimize the resulting radio environment map (i.e., minimizing the average prediction-error variance) for a given data acquisition budget.

Similar to other SC applications, location privacy is of great concern to vehicle workers as they are required to disclose their own location information to servers to facilitate the utilities of SC services. Traditional location privacy protection mechanisms cannot be directly applied to vehicle-based SC since they assume workers' location on a 2-dimensional plane, which does not take into account the features of vehicle workers' mobility in vehicle road networks. Accordingly, in this paper, we aim at addressing issues related to Vehicle-based spatial crowdsourcing Location Privacy (VLP) in vehicle road networks. Our objective is to design a location obfuscation strategy to minimize the loss of quality-of-service (QoS) due to task distribution with location obfuscation, while guaranteeing geo-indistinguishability to be satisfied. Considering the computational complexity of the VLP problem, by resorting to discretization, we approximate VLP to a linear programming problem that can be solved by existing well-developed approaches (such as the simplex method). To further improve the time efficiency, we reduce the number of constraints in VLP by exploiting key features of geo-indistinguishability in vechicle road networks (such as transitivity). Finally, our experimental results demonstrate that our approach can achieve a reasonable approximation of the minimum QoS loss with location privacy protected, and also outperforms a known state-of-the-art location obfuscation strategy in terms of both QoS and privacy.","2575-8411","978-1-7281-2519-0","10.1109/ICDCS.2019.00109","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8885076","Location privacy;spatial crowdsourcing;geo indistinguishability","Roads;Quality of service;Privacy;Task analysis;Crowdsourcing;Servers;Euclidean distance","","22","","34","IEEE","31 Oct 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the biggest obstacle is the cost of radio map building when calibrating the reference point absolute position within the floor plan. An efficient method is to make use of pedestrian dead reckoning (PDR) by sampling the PDR trajectory as the reference point position. Unfortunately, it is valid only when the start point or/and the end point is known. Without knowing this information, the PDR trajectory sampling position is merely a relative position but not an absolute one, which could not be used to build the radio map, especially in the crowdsourcing way. In this paper, we propose an effective method to transform PDR trajectory position sampling from a relative one to an absolute one by matching PDR trajectory with the major possible trajectories within the floor plan. We introduce image processing method to match the PDR trajectory with all the major possible trajectories based on Hough transform, Harris corner detection. The simulation results show that the proposed method could succeed to provide the absolute position from the PDR trajectory, and offer a good radio map for localization in a crowdsourcing way.","1938-1883","978-1-4673-8999-0","10.1109/ICC.2017.7996457","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7996457","Radio map;crowdsourcing;PDR;trajectory matching","Ad hoc networks","","22","","15","IEEE","31 Jul 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Then, we further extend the coverage of road paths by processing the PDR traces entirely obtained indoor by compensating the turning errors and merging the PDR traces based on the similarity of WiFi fingerprints. With such procedures, we can accurately generate indoor road paths of a large-scale building and construct the radio map based on these road paths. Our proposed method achieves a median accuracy of 2.8m and mean accuracy of 2.9m for the constructed road paths. By fusing GPS, PDR, and WiFi fingerprinting with the crowdsourcing radio map, we achieve a median positioning accuracy of 2.9m and mean accuracy of 3.4m without site surveying, which significantly outperforms the positioning algorithm by merely fusing GPS and PDR.","1938-1883","978-1-5386-3180-5","10.1109/ICC.2018.8422967","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8422967","","Global Positioning System;Roads;Crowdsourcing;Buildings;Wireless fidelity;Logic gates;Turning","","19","","10","IEEE","30 Jul 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A promising approach for effective cooperative sensing over a large geographic region is to rely on special spectrum-sensing providers (SSPs), which outsource spectrum-sensing tasks to distributed mobile users. Its feasibility is deeply rooted in the ubiquitous penetration of mobile devices into everyday life. Crowdsourcing-based cooperative spectrum sensing is, however, vulnerable to malicious sensing data injection attack, in which a malicious CR users submit false sensing reports containing power measurements much larger (or smaller) than the true value to inflate (or deflate) the final average, in which case the SSP may falsely determine that the channel is busy (or vacant). In this paper, we propose a novel scheme to enable secure crowdsourcing-based cooperative spectrum sensing by jointly considering the instantaneous trustworthiness of mobile detectors in combination with their reputation scores during data fusion. Our scheme can enable robust cooperative sensing even if the malicious CR users are the majority.

This work investigates the influence of the number of presented speech stimuli on the reliability of listeners' ratings in the context of subjective speech quality assessment. A crowdsourcing study have been conducted with 209 listeners that were asked to rate speech stimuli with respect to their overall quality. Participants were randomly assigned to one of three user groups, each of which was confronted with tasks consisting of a different number of stimuli: 10, 20, or 40. The results from the three groups are highly correlated to existing laboratory ratings, the group with the largest number of samples offering the highest correlation.

A central process in crowdsourcing is the mechanism through which workers find tasks. On popular platforms such as Amazon Mechanical Turk, tasks can be sorted by dimensions such as creation date or reward amount. Research efforts on task assignment have focused on adopting a requester-centric approach whereby tasks are proposed to workers in order to maximize overall task throughput, result quality and cost. In this paper, we advocate the need to complement that with a worker-centric approach to task assignment, and examine the problem of producing, for each worker, a personalized summary of tasks that preserves overall task throughput. We formalize task composition for workers as an optimization problem that finds a representative set of k valid and relevant Composite Tasks (CTs). Validity enforces that a composite task complies with the task arrival rate and satisfies the worker's expected wage. Relevance imposes that tasks match the worker's qualifications. We show empirically that workers' experience is greatly improved due to task homogeneity in each CT and to the adequation of CTs with workers' skills. As a result task throughput is improved.","","978-1-5090-5206-6","10.1109/DSAA.2016.27","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7796905","crowdsourcing;task-composition;clustering;fuzzy","Crowdsourcing;Throughput;Optimization;Buildings;Urban areas;Computed tomography;Clustering algorithms","","12","","37","IEEE","26 Dec 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To fill this gap, this paper presents a study that explores the role of documentation on TopCoder platform, focusing on the task selection and execution. We conducted a two-phased study with professionals that had no prior contact with TopCoder. Based on data collected with questionnaires, diaries, and a retrospective session, we could understand how people choose and perform the tasks, and the role of documentation in the platform. We could find that poorly specified or incomplete tasks lead developers to look for supplementary material or invest more time and effort than initially estimated. To better support the crowd members, we proposed a model on how to structure the documentation that composes the task description in competitive software crowdsourcing. We evaluated the model with another set of professionals, again relying on questionnaires, reports, and a retrospective session. Results showed that although the documentation available covered the elements of the proposed model, the participants had issues to find the necessary information, suggesting the need for a reorganization.

Based on the notion that the requestor (i.e., the crowdsourcer) can block malicious behaviors via leveraging the market power through task allocation and pricing, we propose two novel frameworks based on the mechanism design game theory (i.e., the reverse game theory). To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to exploit the market power and to apply the mechanism design game theory in thwarting malicious behaviors in crowdsourcing. The first proposed framework is built on a requestor-dominant mechanism design game (Rd-MDG), where the game rule is determined solely by the requestor. The second proposed framework is based on the worker-assisted mechanism design game (WaMDG), where the worker (i.e., the contributor) can assist the requestor to determine the game rules by offering advices. These two frameworks have the following salient features: i) neither of them requires the workers to reveal their private information; ii) the game rules of each framework are designed to be able to force the workers to calculate their best strategies based on their actual private information; iii) our theoretical analysis shows that equilibriums exist for both frameworks; and iv) our extensive simulation results demonstrate that these two frameworks can thwart malicious behaviors by driving the workers with a higher attack intent into obtaining lower utilities.","","978-1-5090-5336-0","10.1109/INFOCOM.2017.8057176","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8057176","","Games;Crowdsourcing;Game theory;Resource management;Electronic mail;Conferences","","10","","16","IEEE","5 Oct 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Our method may be used as a drop-in replacement for the majority vote algorithms used in online crowdsourcing services that aggregate multiple human annotations into a final consolidated label. In experiments conducted on two real-life applications we find that our method can reduce the number of required annotations by as much as a factor of 5.4 and can reduce the residual annotation error by up to 90% when compared with majority voting.

One of the core problems in crowdsourcing systems is how to assign tasks to most suitable workers for better results, which heavily relies on the accurate profiling of each worker’s reliability for different topics of tasks. Many previous work have studied worker reliability for either explicit topics represented by task descriptions or latent topics for categorical tasks. In this work, we aim to accurately estimate more fine-grained worker reliability for latent topics in numerical tasks, so as to further improve the result quality. We propose a bayesian probabilistic model named Gaussian Latent Topic Model(GLTM) to mine the latent topics of numerical tasks based on workers’ behaviors and to estimate workers’ topic-level reliability. By utilizing the GLTM, we propose a truth inference algorithm named TI-GLTM to accurately infer the tasks’ truth and topics simultaneously and dynamically update workers’ topic-level reliability. We also design an online task assignment mechanism called MRA-GLTM, which assigns appropriate tasks to workers with the Maximum Reduced Ambiguity principle. The experiment results show our algorithms can achieve significantly lower MAE and MSE than that of the state-of-the-art approaches.","2641-9874","978-1-6654-0325-2","10.1109/INFOCOM42981.2021.9488748","National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9488748","","Crowdsourcing;Heuristic algorithms;Conferences;Reliability engineering;Probabilistic logic;Inference algorithms;Numerical models","","9","","37","IEEE","26 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

One example in wireless networking is mobile crowdsourcing, which leverages a cloud computing platform for recruiting mobile users to collect data (such as photos, videos, mobile user activities, etc) for applications in various domains, such as environmental monitoring, social networking, healthcare, transportation, etc. However, a critical problem arises as how to ensure that users pay or receive what they deserve. Free-riding and false-reporting may make the system vulnerable to dishonest users. In this paper, we aim to design schemes to tackle these problems, so that each individual in the system is better off being honest. We first design a mechanism EFF which eliminates dishonest behavior with the help from a trusted third party for arbitration. We then design another mechanism DFF which, without the help from any third party, discourages free-riding and false-reporting. We prove that EFF eliminates the existence of free-riding and false-reporting, while guaranteeing truthfulness, individual rationality, budget-balance, and computational efficiency. We also prove that DFF is semi-truthful, which discourages dishonest behavior such as free-riding and false-reporting when the rest of the individuals are honest, while guaranteeing budget-balance and computational efficiency. Performance evaluation shows that within our mechanisms, no dishonest behavior could bring extra benefit for each individual.","1930-529X","978-1-4799-3512-3","10.1109/GLOCOM.2014.7037593","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7037593","","Mobile communication;Crowdsourcing;Warranties;Wireless communication;Mobile computing;Computational modeling;Cost accounting","","9","","25","IEEE","12 Feb 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As a consequence, ITU-T Rec. P.808 specifies requirements for the listening environment of crowd workers when assessing speech quality. In this paper, we propose a new Just Noticeable Difference of Quality (JNDQ) test as a remote screening method for assessing the suitability of the work environment for participating in speech quality assessment tasks. In a laboratory experiment, participants performed this JNDQ test with different listening devices in different listening environments, including a silent room according to ITU-T Rec.

Thus, the combination of listening device and background noise needs to be screened in a crowdsourcing speech quality test.

Recalibrations are necessary periodically to compensate the drifts of radio map. Many crowdsourcing-based approaches have been proposed to calibrate the radio map strategically with user-contributed data. However, these approaches still suffer from several drawbacks. Calibration-on-demand is desirable to reduce the maintenance cost and to enhance the reliability of the Wi-Fi IPS. Wi-Fi IPS degrades only when the radio map changes significantly and lastingly. Such changes are caused by radio map anomalous events. Examples of these events include changes in indoor environment, existence of spurious data from the sensing system and unexpected failure in utility infrastructures. This paper presents a theoretical and experimental study of a crowdsourcing online Wi-Fi radio map anomalous event detection system. Detection of these events will enhance the operation intelligence of Wi-Fi IPS and enable high-level context-aware services. This system is consisted of an outlier detector for abnormal signal identification and an event discriminator for determination of event occurrence. Real world smartphone data and simulated data are used to test the performance of the system. Initial results show that the system is able to detect over 92% of simulated events and 87.5% of real world events with a low false alarm rate.","","978-1-4673-8054-6","10.1109/IPIN.2014.7275487","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7275487","Wi-Fi;Indoor Positioning System;Calibration-on-demand;Crowdsourcing;Anomalous Event Detection","IEEE 802.11 Standard;Indoor navigation;Detectors;Event detection;Fingerprint recognition;Mathematical model;Crowdsourcing","","7","1","32","IEEE","28 Sep 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To determine the most suitable configurations as well as workers for video analytics, we formulate a non-linear mixed program in a long-term scope, maximizing the profit for the crowdsourcing platform. Based on previous results under various configurations and workers, we design an algorithm via a series of subproblems to decide the configurations adaptively upon the prediction of the worker rewards. Such prediction is based on volatile multi-armed bandit to capture the workers’ availability and stochastic changes on resource uses. Via rigorous proof, the regret is ensured upon the Lyapunov optimization and the bandit, measuring the gap between the online decisions and the offline optimum. Extensive trace-driven experiments show that our algorithm improves the platform profit by 37%, compared with other algorithms.","2641-9874","978-1-6654-5822-1","10.1109/INFOCOM48880.2022.9796960","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9796960","","Crowdsourcing;Annotations;Visual analytics;Heuristic algorithms;Conferences;Manuals;Prediction algorithms","","7","","49","IEEE","20 Jun 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In a real crowdsourcing market, each answer obtained from a worker incurs cost. The cost is associated with both the level of trustworthiness of workers and the difficulty of tasks. Typically, access to expert-level (more trustworthy) workers is more expensive than to average crowd and completion of a challenging task is more costly than a click-away question. In this paper, we address the problem of optimal assignment of heterogeneous tasks to workers of varying trust levels with budget constraint. Specifically, we design a trust-aware task allocation algorithm that takes as inputs the estimated trust of workers and pre-set budget, and outputs the optimal assignment of tasks to workers. We derive the bound of total error probability that relates to budget, trustworthiness of crowds, and costs of obtaining labels from crowds naturally. Higher budget, more trustworthy crowds, and less costly jobs result in lower theoretical bound. Our allocation scheme does not depend on the specific design of the trust evaluation component. Therefore, it can be combined with generic trust evaluation algorithms. Our algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art by up to 30% on real data.","1938-1883","978-1-4673-6432-4","10.1109/ICC.2015.7248482","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7248482","","","","7","","14","IEEE","10 Sep 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To fully make use of these resources, mobile crowdsourcing applications have attracted particular interests from academia and industry, and they are extensively integrated with fog computing for obtaining low latency and location sensitivity. In this paper, we consider a fog-based task allocation service for mobile crowdsourcing tasks with multiple locations, where a task is allocated to the worker whose future trajectory has the smallest Hausdorff semi-distance to the task locations. However, as fog nodes are not fully trusted, there may exist privacy concerns related to the workers and the task owners. To the best of our knowledge, although Hausdorff semi-distance has been applied in various applications, none of the existing works can support privacy-preserving Hausdorff semi-distance evaluation or $k$ nearest neighbor queries. Aiming at this issue, we design a privacy-preserving fog-based multi-location task allocation scheme. Specifically, based on a symmetric homomorphic encryption technique, we build two privacy-preserving protocols for i) computing min/max value from an array and ii) retrieving the key linked to the minimum value from an array of key-value pairs. Then, the proposed scheme is built upon these two protocols. After that, we conduct rigid security analysis and extensive experiments to demonstrate the security and efficiency of our proposed scheme, respectively. The results indicate that our proposed scheme is not only privacy-preserving, but also efficient in terms of both computation and communication costs.","2576-6813","978-1-7281-8104-2","10.1109/GLOBECOM46510.2021.9685819","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9685819","","Crowdsourcing;Privacy;Protocols;Costs;Sensitivity;Trajectory;Computational efficiency","","6","","8","Crown","2 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this article, we adopt the learning with expert~(AKA worker in crowdsourcing) advice framework to robustly infer accurate labels by considering the reliability of each worker. However, in order to accurately predict the reliability of each worker, traditional learning with expert advice will consult with external oracles~(AKA domain experts) on the true label of each instance. To reduce the cost of consultation, we proposed two active learning approaches, margin-based and weighted difference of advices based. Meanwhile, to address the problem of limited annotation budget, we proposed a reliability-based assigning approach which actively decides who to annotate the next instance based on each worker's cumulative performance.

R-safety also aims to inform citizens about risk areas through a vulnerability map that divides the areas into five types from the least dangerous to the most dangerous. In our approach, we are interested in improving the current situation of road safety by integrating the opinions of road users in the decision support tool of the national observatory of road safety. Thus, integrating citizens opinions into the information system would serve to have new sources of incoming data to improve decisions.

However, crowdsourcing-based approaches require a large number of volunteers to monitor and report signals on streets, and war driving is too coarse for accurate map construction in complicated urban building environment. In this paper, we propose a Wi-Fi radio map construction mechanism using both crowdsourcing and highly-precise simulation. Once some cooperative smartphone users collect Wi-Fi beacon data with RSS information, it estimates “tx-tile” for each AP, which is “virtual” transmission source on a wall of the building where AP is inside. Then using this tx-tile with estimated tx-power, it executes online Wi-Fi radio propagation simulations with 3D city models to complement RSS information in many other areas that are not covered by the limited number of cooperative users. We have evaluated the tx-tile localization error and the quality of the radio map. Also we demonstrate our Wi-Fi radio map system for Osaka city.","","978-3-901882-94-4","10.23919/IFIPNetworking.2017.8264841","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8264841","","Wireless fidelity;Urban areas;Smart phones;Buildings;Solid modeling;Observers;Three-dimensional displays","","6","","22","","22 Jan 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, a major obstacle to put it into practice is the huge computational complexity and memory consumption of neural networks. The onboard computers inside robots are usually of limited capability and cannot support the inference of large-scale neural networks with reasonable latency, a property essential to many tasks in the physical world. Moreover, because of the unstable or unacceptable network latency, it is hard to offload computation to powerful backend infrastructure (e.g., data centers) in many cases as well. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a novel ""crowdsourcing"" approach to enable efficient inference of large-scale deep learning models on a group of resource-constrained robots. ""Crowdsourcing"" means that the deep learning tasks on a single robot can exploit the idle computing power of robots in the proximity. This goal is achieved by splitting a network into several parts and distributing them to different robots with the help of the proposed latency prediction and optimal partition selection algorithms. The experiments show that our approach achieves on average 6.01X and up to 46.59X latency speedup in contrast with the approaches in which the models are executed locally on the robot or remotely on the cloud.","","978-1-7281-4034-6","10.1109/SmartWorld-UIC-ATC-SCALCOM-IOP-SCI.2019.00194","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9060297","Deep Learning, Cooperative Robots, Model Partition, Deep Neural Networks, Convolution Neural Networks","Robots;Computational modeling;Predictive models;Task analysis;Data models;Cloud computing;Hardware","","6","","13","IEEE","9 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Crowdsourcing marketplaces can potentially recruit workers to run tools from networks not covered by the volunteer pool. We design an infrastructure to collect and synchronize measurements from five crowdsourcing platforms, and use that infrastructure to collect data on network source address validation policies for CAIDA's Spoofer project. In six weeks we increased the coverage of Spoofer measurements by recruiting 1519 workers from within 91 countries and 784 unique ASes for 2,000 Euro; 342 of these ASes were not previously covered, and represent a 15% increase in ASes over the prior 12 months.

Considering the various delay demands of tasks in smart cities, we design a delay-aware incentive mechanism to employ vehicles based on reverse auction. Specifically, by taking task delay into consideration, we model the utility of service requester as a function closely related to when its released tasks would be completed. In our mechanism, the participating vehicles bid for their preferred tasks by submitting not only the bidding prices, but also the estimated time of completion (ETC). To maximize the utility of the service requester under a budget constraint, the proposed delay-aware mechanism is cast as a nonmonotone submodular maximization problem with a knapsack constraint. Due to the NP-hardness of the formulated problem, we develop an approximate algorithm for bid selection and payment determination, which guarantees truthfulness, budget feasibility, individual rationality, profitability, and computational efficiency.

Such crowdsourcing systems can play a vital role during emergency events, where fast and accurate responses are needed. However, a commonly ignored aspect is how the price (i.e. the reward paid to workers) must be set in order for the system to meet two important requirements: (i) to timely receive an adequate number of responses which is crucial during emergencies, and (ii) to meet budget constraints. In the majority of the existing systems, the price per task is set up-front and remains unchanged for all upcoming tasks, leading to either higher monetary cost than necessary or to significantly larger latency than expected. In this work, we provide a formulation based on Kalman Filters that enables the system to estimate the user/worker behavior, i.e., the likelihood over time for a user to provide answers for a specific reward. Specifically, we focus on the problem of developing an adaptive pricing policy to incentivize the users to rapidly provide their responses. Our mechanism can be adjusted dynamically to bridge the gap among the users' behavior and the system's needs so as to maximize the overall utility of the system.

This paper presents an approach to handle these name ambiguity problems through the use of crowdsourcing as a complementary means to traditional unsupervised approaches. To this end, we present “AuthCrowd”, a crowdsourcing system with the ability to decompose named entity disambiguation and entity matching tasks. Experimental results on a real-world dataset of publicly available papers published in peer-reviewed venues demonstrate the potential of our proposed approach for improving author name disambiguation.

This paper introduces a novel crowdsourcing method for automatic AP localization and propagation parameters (PPs) estimation based on the navigation solution from the Trusted Portable Navigator (T-PN). The estimation for PPs and AP locations based on non-linear weighted least squares (LSQ) is carried out automatically when enough measurements are collected, and the results are recorded in the database for future use. The fast estimation method calculates the propagation parameters autonomously and adaptively to account for the dynamic indoor environment. The autonomous system will also reduce the labour and time costs for the pre-survey and maintenance of databases, as the crowdsourcing is always done in background processes on devices. The accuracy of AP localization is also estimated and recorded in the database, providing an important indicator when using the AP localization results. The performance of the proposed system is evaluated by both simulations and field tests, and the result shows that the average AP localization errors are less than 6 meters.","","978-1-4799-6004-0","10.1109/UPINLBS.2014.7033737","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7033737","Access points localization;propagation parameters;crowdsourcing;least squares;WiFi;smartphone","Databases;IEEE 802.11 Standards;Estimation;Navigation;Crowdsourcing;Vectors;Position measurement","","5","1","18","IEEE","9 Feb 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For this purpose, it is desired to develop a robust model for learning SVP from crowdsourced noisy annotations. In this paper, we construct a deep SVP prediction model which not only leads to better detection of annotation outliers but also enables learning with extremely sparse annotations. Specifically, we construct a comparison multi-graph based on the collected annotations, where different labeling results correspond to edges with different directions between two vertexes.

However, collecting visual fingerprints is a labor-intensive and time-consuming procedure. In order to address this problem, we propose a novel crowdsourcing-based framework, and leverage a variety of sensors embedded in smartphones to collect richer location fingerprints for exploring their positive effects. To achieve higher recognition accuracy, we propose an object-centric fingerprint searching which can sufficiently take advantage of smartphone sensors and determine more accurate searching space than the traditional user-centric method. We build a crowdsourcing-based database with richer fingerprints and implement a location recognition system, called CrowdLR. Extensive experiments verify that our object-centric method can achieve promising results maintaining around 10% precision higher than the user-centric method.","1521-9097","978-0-7695-5785-4","10.1109/ICPADS.2015.28","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7384291","Mobile Location Recognition;Crowdsourcing;Fingerprint;Smartphone Sensor;Object-centric","Databases;Search problems;Sensors;Fingerprint recognition;Servers;Visualization;Global Positioning System","","4","","13","IEEE","18 Jan 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The widely available mobile sensors are used in collecting information during a task processing. However, gathering information from a remote place, or an area of disaster, is not trivial, given the unavailability of appropriate infrastructure. Existing delay tolerant networking approaches address this issue but suffer from unsatisfactory performance due to the lack of sufficient user participation. We propose the Delay-tolerant Cloud Computing framework (D-CLOC), a cloud framework utilizing the contextual information of a mobile client. Our proposed architecture combines crowdsourcing and the cellular network and forms a temporal delay tolerant cloud. D-CLOC uses a bidding incentive model to ensure and promote user participation in the cloud. We provide a detailed reasoning of the security and feasibility of our model, and delineate probable approaches for solving the various security related aspects. The paper includes the design and implementation of a realistic-simulation model for D-CLOC. The simulation scenario incorporates an example face recognition task for evaluating the performance of our proposed model. Our experimental results show that D-CLOC performs quite well compared to some of the existing DTN approaches and can be deployed for solving any real life problems using crowdsourcing within a delay tolerant cloud infrastructure.","","978-1-4673-9560-1","10.1109/CloudCom.2015.39","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7396149","delay tolerant cloud;ad hoc cloud;sense cloud","Cloud computing;Sensors;Crowdsourcing;Computer architecture;Delays;Mobile communication;Computational modeling","","4","","43","IEEE","4 Feb 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Task assignment is a key issue in spatial crowdsourcing. In practice, tasks are unevenly distributed in time and space. Accordingly, the problem of cross task assignment attracts growing attention in both industry and academia. Although there has been a research on this problem, it focuses only on maximizing total revenues for inner platforms. Therefore, it can also be improved to bring a multi-win situation for outer workers and task requesters as well as the inner platform. Inspired by this, we first formulate a new cross dynamic task assignment (CDTA) problem by introducing the reputation scores of workers, and prove it to be NP-hard. For the CDTA problem, a hybrid batch-based framework is presented on the basis of a new cross-platform incentive mechanism and a hybrid batch processing strategy, which are efficient in solving the problem of uneven spatial and time distribution of tasks, respectively. After that, a KM-based algorithm and a density-aware greedy algorithm are proposed to gain an accurate assignment result of tasks in each batch and good performance, respectively. Furthermore, the CDTA problem is modeled as a potential game that is proven to have at least a pure Nash Equilibrium theoretically. Last but not least, a game-theoretic approach is developed to maximize the revenues of the inner platform and outer workers at the same time. Extensive experiments on both real and synthetic datasets are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithms.","2375-026X","979-8-3503-2227-9","10.1109/ICDE55515.2023.00113","Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10184631","Game Theory;Spatial Crowdsourcing;Task Assignment","Crowdsourcing;Industries;Smart cities;Heuristic algorithms;Transportation;Games;Nash equilibrium","","4","","50","IEEE","26 Jul 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Recently, in order to solve the situation of non-uniform distribution of tasks and crowd workers on a single platform, cross online task assignment has been proposed aiming at increasing the mutual benefit through cooperations.

Crowdsourcing individual users' measurements can provide accurate localization without costly site-survey. However, crowdsourcing based approaches suffer from the cold start problem, in which at the beginning of system deployment, there are insufficient users to contribute their measurements, resulting in inaccurate and time-inefficient localization. In this paper, we propose a hybrid indoor localization method to solve such problem, called ACIL. We first employ the inertial navigation technique to localize some core positions or paths. To tackle the inaccuracy problem, we propose an effective method that utilizes the channel state information (CSI) of wireless signals for accurate distance estimation. This method is based on a new observation: there is a ripple-like fading pattern in wireless signals upon moving objects. Leveraging this observation, our system is capable of calculating the distance of human's movement and his/her direction. We also propose a graph-matching algorithm to setup the correlation between the trajectory and floor map. With those extra obtained location information, the impact of cold start issue will be significantly mitigated, while the LBS can be guaranteed with high localization accuracy.

However, generic FML methods may lead to privacy-leakage through the sharing of training information of individual models and have relatively poor performance when the training datasets for individual models are biased and diversified. This is a problem in combining models trained in different scenarios of IoT devices since the available training datasets are usually limited and biased. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel approach to precisely ensemble results from different models in distributed edge devices. Instead of passing the training information of individual models around that requires a relatively large amount of bandwidth and compromises data privacy, we suggest employing a trusted central agent that only collects different inference results from edge devices. Then based on a limited amount of labeled data, the agent runs a designed statistical iterative crowdsourcing algorithm to combine results for a more accurate aggregated prediction towards a user query. Our proposed system model, ""Privacy-Preserving Federated Learning System"", together with our light-weight Secure Crowdsourcing Aggregation (SC-Agg) algorithm, provide a more accurate prediction for outside queries at little cost without any prior knowledge of what query will be submitted. We experimentally verify that in our system, SC-Agg consistently outperforms the majority voting method and the best performing model of the ensemble in all testing scenarios.

To preserve from damages those places, strong preventive actions have been started. Now the actual implementation is limited to digital materials comprising photos, videos and documents. The research proposes the use of crowdsourcing as instrument to build the database necessary to make 3D models of cultural assets at low costs and with a short development time. Crowdsourcing is the practice of obtaining needed services, ideas, or content by soliciting contributions from a large group of people. Thus, tourists and inhabitants can contribute in the preservation process of cultural assets increasing the resilience of cities.","","978-1-5386-5186-5","10.1109/EEEIC.2018.8494355","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8494355","cultural heritage;photogrammetry;smart city;crowdsourcing","Cultural differences;Three-dimensional displays;Buildings;Crowdsourcing;Databases;Solid modeling;Cameras","","3","","33","IEEE","18 Oct 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"Data crowdsourcing and traffic sensitive routing for a mixed mode public transit system","J. Balagapo; J. Sabidong; J. Caro","Department of Computer Science, University of the Philippines, Quezon City; Department of Computer Science, University of the Philippines, Quezon City; Department of Computer Science, University of the Philippines, Quezon City","IISA 2014, The 5th International Conference on Information, Intelligence, Systems and Applications","18 Aug 2014","2014","","","1","6","In this paper, we propose transit journaling, a crowdsourcing solution for public transit data collection, and we describe CommYouTer, an Android app for this purpose. CommYouTer enables the user to (1) document his public transit trips with automated transfer detection, (2) participate in crowdsourcing real-time traffic conditions and other relevant data, and (3) query for efficient commuting directions via a traffic-sensitive routing algorithm. For transit journaling, the app offers a recording feature that uses the smartphone's GPS antenna and accelerometer to track the user's location and activity. Activity detection is applied to the mobile phone's accelerometer data to differentiate between two user states (walking vs. non-walking), which are then used to determine vehicle transfers along the journey. We also implement our modification of RAPTOR, an existing round-based public transit routing algorithm. Our modification allows the system to account for real-time crowdsourced traffic conditions. We test our system in Metro Manila, Philippines, where public transit is primarily headway-based (non-scheduled).","","978-1-4799-6171-9","10.1109/IISA.2014.6878754","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6878754","","Routing;Vehicles;Legged locomotion;Roads;Global Positioning System;Crowdsourcing;Real-time systems","","3","2","23","IEEE","18 Aug 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
