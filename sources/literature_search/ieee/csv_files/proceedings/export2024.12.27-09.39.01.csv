Engineers and potential customers work together mainly in a virtual world for the design and realization of the product. We address this so called “crowdsourcing” trend in the automotive industry that lowers cost and accelerates production of new car. Current practice and prior studies fail to handle data management and collaboration aspects in sufficient detail. We propose a PLM based crowdsourcing platform that applies best practices to the established approach and adapt it with new methods for handling specific requirements.

One commonly used format for these experiments is the two-alternative forced choice method. Two stimuli with the same content but differing visual quality are presented sequentially or side-by-side. Subjects are asked to select the one of better quality, and when uncertain, they are required to guess. The relaxed alternative forced choice format aims to reduce the cognitive load and the noise in the responses due to the guessing by providing a third response option, namely, “not sure”. This work presents a large and comprehensive crowdsourcing experiment to compare these two response formats: the one with the “not sure” option and the one without it. To provide unambiguous ground truth for quality evaluation, subjects were shown pairs of images with differing numbers of dots and asked each time to choose the one with more dots. Our crowdsourcing study involved 254 participants and was conducted using a within-subject design. Each participant was asked to respond to 40 pair comparisons with and without the “not sure” response option and completed a questionnaire to evaluate their cognitive load for each testing condition. The experimental results show that the inclusion of the “not sure” response option in the forced choice method reduced mental load and led to models with better data fit and correspondence to ground truth. We also tested for the equivalence of the models and found that they were different.

However, because of the variety and overwhelming size and scale of the workforce available, it is often difficult for clients to identify the most appropriate candidates. To ease this difficulty, Crowdsourcing Service Providers (CSPs) provide information, such as worker's skills, the number of tasks completed, and other indicators to help clarify their ability. However, it is hard to tell how useful this information really is in determining whether or not a candidate is the right one for a task. In this paper, in addition to looking at information provided by CSPs, Individual Work Performance (IWP) as an indicator of overall job performance and the Big Five traits as indicator of personality are obtained from crowd workers. Whether these indicators help in predicting the quality of their performance is investigated. A task of translating a Japanese article into English was posted at a Japanese CSP. This resulted in submissions from 36 crowd workers who also filled out a survey related to IWP and the Big Five traits. Based on the data collected, the correlation between these indicators and the quality of output was examined. The results showed that CSP-provided indicators actually have limited correlation with the quality of output. On the other hand, there was a moderate correlation between the quality and one of the subsets of IWP (CWB: Counterproductive Work Behavior), as well as one of the subsets of the Big Five traits (conscientiousness). In particular, there was a strong correlation between low performers and CWB and conscientiousness.","","978-1-4673-8985-3","10.1109/IIAI-AAI.2016.13","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7557708","crowdsourcing;work performance;Big Five;personal selection","Correlation;Crowdsourcing;Organizations;Stability criteria;Technological innovation;Informatics","","3","","21","IEEE","1 Sep 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The demand for public transport is also increasing with this increasing population. Most of the people use public transport to go to desired places as they are less expensive. In a crowded city, traffic jam, mismanagement of the transport system and some other issues cause the desired transport not to reach the destination in proper time. People had to wait for a long time to get their desired transport. Moreover, there is also a security issue for the people during night time. In this paper, we proposed a framework for public transport management system using crowdsourcing for smartphones. This system will help users to find the nearest public transport like bus, train, etc. to their desired route. In this system, smartphones collect location information using GPS and send it to the system. Users have to provide their source and destination location for searching the available nearby public transports. Then, the system will track the nearby public transport information using mobile crowdsourcing. The users can view the exact position of the transport and reach the stoppage without wasting any time. This system helps the user to reduce their mental pressure and also increase their security. The entire experiment is done using only 300 public transport information for some region of Dhaka city. In future, we will increase the size of our data set. We will implement the system for different smartphones to make the system more user-friendly.","","978-1-7281-3018-7","10.1109/ICAITI48442.2019.8982126","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8982126","Mobile Crowdsourcing;Transport Management;GPS;Service Provisioning.","","","2","","18","IEEE","6 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Crowdsourcing is flexible and convenient to reduce transportation costs and carbon emissions. However, crowdshipping requires to adapt to real-time changes such as road conditions and customer demands, which heuristic algorithms are not suitable for addressing these issues. Therefore, this study proposes a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach to react to real-time environmental changes to solve the CVRP. The CVRP considers a single depot and multiple transfer points to serve multiple customers, in which cargos can be delivered by either the vehicle directly, or crowdworkers after the vehicle stores cargos at transfer points. In the proposed DRL, the agent explores feasible decisions, and revises the path that it should take based on feedbacks. The cost effectiveness that affects crowdshipping includes the vehicle routing, and whether the concerned customer is suitable for crowdshipping. The experimental results show the efficiency and accuracy of the trained model for medium-sized VRPs are much higher than classical heuristic algorithms.","","978-1-6654-8687-3","10.1109/IEEM55944.2022.9989773","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9989773","Vehicle routing problem;crowdsourcing;machine learning","Crowdsourcing;Deep learning;Costs;Heuristic algorithms;Roads;Vehicle routing;Transportation","","2","","12","IEEE","26 Dec 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In particular, our proposed scheme utilizes Prefix Encoding (PE) and Bloom Filter (BF) techniques to convert a large domain into a binary domain for improved query accuracy. When responding to the query, individual users can check a Bloom filter to determine whether their private item is within the query range and use the Basic Randomized Response (BRR) technique to perturb their result for achieving ε-LDP.

However, empowering any user to develop a classifier for their concept is technically difficult: users are neither machine learning experts nor have the patience to label thousands of examples. In reaction, we introduce the problem of Agile Modeling: the process of turning any subjective visual concept into a computer vision model through real-time user-in-the-loop interactions. We instantiate an Agile Modeling prototype for image classification and show through a user study (N=14) that users can create classifiers with minimal effort in under 30 minutes. We compare this user driven process with the traditional crowdsourcing paradigm and find that the crowd’s notion often differs from that of the user’s, especially as the concepts become more subjective. Finally, we scale our experiments with simulations of users training classifiers for ImageNet21k categories to further demonstrate the efficacy of the approach.","2380-7504","979-8-3503-0718-4","10.1109/ICCV51070.2023.02040","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10378511","","Crowdsourcing;Training;Computer vision;Visualization;Computational modeling;Prototypes;Turning","","2","","68","IEEE","15 Jan 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The MCS platform allocates sensing resources to selected crowdsensing tasks and charge crowdsourcers corresponding prices. To begin with, we formulate the sensing resource allocation as a social welfare maximization problem, and propose a primal-dual approximation algorithm that achieves a feasible solution in polynomial time with guaranteed approximation ratio.

In applications like geonsensitive navigation, location-based activity sharing and recommendations, the challenge of adequate service quality and user experience may be at stake, as the services are provided securely to an ever-growing user population. This happens due to the inherent trade-off between security and real-time performance that ultimately sets in doubt any scalability prospect beyond a certain user-interaction load. This work introduces a publish-subscribe architecture for mobile crowdsensing systems, which can be transparently scaled up to higher usage load, while retaining adequate performance and security by load balancing into multiple MQTT brokers. The security support combines a lightweight TLS implementation with an integrated mechanism for two-level access control: user-device interactions and message topics. We provide proof-of-concept measurements that show how our solution scales to increasing interaction loads through load-balancing the processing cost that includes the overhead of the security mechanisms applied. The system architecture was implemented in a vehicular crowdsensing navigation network that allows to exchange navigation information at real-time, for improved routing of vehicles to their destination.","","978-0-7381-2460-5","10.1109/IOTSMS52051.2020.9340165","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9340165","Internet of Things;crowdsourcing;mobile network;security;load-balancing","Performance evaluation;Crowdsensing;Navigation;Systems architecture;Publish-subscribe;Real-time systems;Statistics","","2","","32","IEEE","2 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper considers a WiFi advisory system, where crowdsourcing technology is used to gather information of wireless networks for understanding wireless network capability better including the coverage, connectivity, and locations of wireless networks. Such a system will address two critical challenges: (1) no self-contained bootstrapping data and (2) device-dependent data processing. To address the first one issue, we design and implement an opportunistic sensing system for smartphones to collect wireless information along human mobility without human engagement. To address the second issue, we design a data aggregation algorithm to infer the locations of wireless networks based on crowdsourced data from several different smartphones. In addition, we also analyze the computation complexity of our data aggregation algorithm. Finally, we implement our wireless network monitoring infrastructure to study the spatial and temporal variation and patterns of wireless networks systematically.","","978-1-4799-8055-0","10.1109/ISSNIP.2015.7106938","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7106938","Crowdsourcing;mobile sensing;participatory sensing;pervasive computing;smart cities","IEEE 802.11 Standards;Wireless sensor networks;Wireless communication;Accuracy","","1","","20","IEEE","14 May 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paradigm relies on the crowd contribution and participation to collect data and relevant information. The abstraction of mobile crowdsourcing as a service has become easier and more seamless thanks to the availability, low-cost and fast access to cloud services. In this context, it is important to satisfy a request for a crowdsourced service, at a given time and place, as soon as possible. Nevertheless, maintaining a balance between the supply and demand of crowdsourced services in a geographic area is challenging given the mobility of both service requesters and providers. Motivated by this requirement, we propose a forecasting approach to infer the supply demand gap of crowdsourced services in a given geographic area. Instead of relying on raw data for prediction, we devise a technique to generate predictors from the raw gap data using topological data analysis to exploit the topological and underlying geometric structures. Our forecasting strategy is conducted in a multiview fashion, that is, we devise the historical time horizon into immediate, near and distant time. Then, using topological analysis, we derive three key features: topological similarity, Betti numbers and the Distance To Measure value (DTM). These features, along with additional context information including weather and temperature, are used to infer the supply-demand gap value using state-of-art prediction approach. Our experiments show that the proposed multiview topological analysis is effective for supply-demand prediction with both clean and noisy data.","2376-6506","978-1-7281-3129-0","10.1109/IWCMC48107.2020.9148097","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9148097","crowdsourced service;supply and demand gap;topological data analysis","Time series analysis;Forecasting;Three-dimensional displays;Level set;Data analysis;Supply and demand;Noise measurement","","1","","19","IEEE","27 Jul 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Existing literature is scarce in multiple aspects, such as the lack of resources that provide high accuracy long-term trend detection in social media platforms and missing the substantive factor for long-term trend detection, and time series forecasting over Natural Language Processing. This research presents a novel methodology to extract insights into low resource language and the responses are validated using the built crowdsourcing platform. Additionally, research employees with several classical time series analysis techniques and different LSTM RNN to identify the best-performing long-term trend analysis method. Novel concept deployed by extracting public data available in YouTube and Twitter which has at least one year of life expressing content related to COVID-19. Preponderance textual engagements were felt under the low resource language category. Crowdsourcing supports mitigating the risk of the intimidating issue. Finally, the data set is employed with time series forecasting. Mean Square Error and Huber loss were employed for testing. Authors argue there is no long-term trend in Twitter posts and YouTube videos with comments more petite than a hundred.

Crowdsourcing is a promising approach for it, but adding alt text to all the images on the Web requires a tremendous amount of effort. In addition, too many alt texts of images also increase the difficulty of reading. Therefore, it is crucial to select important images for understanding web pages. This paper presents the results of our preliminary experiments to identify important images for understanding web pages. We adopted a crowdsourcing approach with two microtask designs. The results of our study demonstrated that (1) there are several types of images that are difficult to automatically assess the importance; thus, human-in-the-loop can be a promising approach to identify important ones in the types of images; and (2) there are microtask designs that can result in the similar results but different to each other in terms of other criteria.

Elevated tuition costs is another factor pushing people into short, internet-based specialized courses or directly into the job market, while an increasing number of people holding full degrees are underemployed in respect to their knowledge level. We propose VUZ, a domain-general framework capable of tackling these issues by designing personalized curricula from a high-level perspective (general courses, subjects and topics) down to specific how to's and step-by-steps, by means of crowdsourcing: delegating the curriculum development to a community of experts. The framework is scalable in the sense that individuals can choose the level of refinement of their curriculum depending on their prior knowledge; is decentralized in the sense that all decisions are taken by the users; and is collaborative because of the possibility of sharing knowledge with other users. We detailed the crowdsourcing algorithm used for curricula development and simulated a VUZ platform using a multiagent system, which yielded a series of cost and retribution results associated to potential users of a VUZ system.","","978-1-5386-5832-1","10.1109/INFORINO.2018.8581804","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8581804","scalable;interdisciplinary;crowdsourcing;curriculum;multiagent;vuz;graphplan","Task analysis;Crowdsourcing;Education;Planning;Information technology;Tools;Artificial intelligence","","1","","11","IEEE","20 Dec 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Our goal is to dynamically determine the optimal neural network architecture that accurately estimates the damage severity for each newly-arrived image in the stream by leveraging human intelligence from the crowdsourcing systems. Our work is motivated by the observations that the neural network architectures in current DDA solutions are mainly designed by AI experts, which often leads to non-negligible costs and errors given the dynamic nature of the streaming DDA applications and the lack of real-time annotations of the massive social media data inputs. In this paper, we develop CD-NAS, a crowd-driven dynamic NAS framework that is inspired by novel techniques from AI, crowdsourcing, and estimation theory to address the dynamic optimal NAS problem. The evaluation results from a real-world streaming DDA application show that CD-NAS consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art AI and NAS baselines by achieving the highest disaster damage assessment accuracy.","1548-615X","978-1-6654-1494-4","10.1109/IWQOS52092.2021.9521346","National Science Foundation; Arm; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9521346","","Crowdsourcing;Social networking (online);Neural networks;Transportation;Quality of service;Estimation theory;Streaming media","","1","","23","IEEE","26 Aug 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, privacy of tasks and workers is usually ignored in most of exiting task matching schemes. To solve this issue, recently, Shu et al. proposed a privacy-preserving task matching with efficient revocation in Crowdsourcing (IEEE Transactions on Dependable and Secure Computing DOI 10.1109/TDSC.2018.2875682) to ensure privacy protection of tasks and workers and achieve the worker revocation. Their scheme had claimed to be selective IND-CKA secure, and realized efficient revocation of the worker. Unfortunately, in this work, by analyzing the security of Shu et al. scheme, we show that their scheme is insecure. It cannot really provide IND-CKA security and realize the revocation of the worker. This is to say, their scheme does not satisfy the confidentiality of keyword since an adversary can distinguish the ciphertexts of arbitrary keywords without trapdoor information. Finally, after the corresponding attacks are given, we analyze the reason to produce such attacks.","","978-1-7281-8635-1","10.1109/ICCC51575.2020.9344933","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9344933","Crowdsourcing;privacy-preserving task matching;cryptanalysis;IND-CKA security;revocation","Crowdsourcing;Privacy;Conferences;Task analysis;Computer security","","1","","26","IEEE","12 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper addresses this problem by proposing a novel algorithm based on graph signal sampling theory, which optimally assigns data to different workers for labeling by taking into account the expected quality of labeling provided by each worker.

Unlike constructing a costly fleet of mapping vehicles, the crowdsourcing paradigm is a cost-effective way to keep an HD map up to date. Achieving practical success for crowdsourcing-based HD maps is contingent on addressing two critical issues: freshness and recruitment costs. Given that crowdsource vehicles are often heterogeneous in terms of operational costs and sensing capabilities, it is practical to recruit heterogeneous crowdsource vehicles to achieve the tradeoff between freshness and recruitment costs. However, existing works neglect this aspect. To solve it, we formulate this problem as a Markov decision process. We demonstrate that the optimal policy is threshold-type age-dependent. Additionally, our findings reveal some counter-intuitive insights. In some cases, the company should initiate vehicle recruitment earlier when vehicles arrive more frequently, or have higher operational costs or sensing capabilities. Besides, we propose an efficient algorithm, called the bound-based relative value iteration (BRVI) algorithm, to overcome the technical challenge that finding an optimal policy is time-consuming. Numerical simulations show that (i) the optimal policy reduces the average cost by 19.04℅ compared to the state-of-the-art mechanism, and (ii) the proposed algorithm can reduce the convergence time by 13.66℅ on average compared to the existing algorithm.","2690-3342","978-3-903176-55-3","10.23919/WiOpt58741.2023.10349885","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10349885","HD map;crowdsourcing;Markov decision process;Age of information","Crowdsourcing;Costs;Wireless networks;Companies;Markov processes;Numerical simulation;Sensors","","1","","32","","22 Dec 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It is crucial to ensure label quality by selecting the most suitable workers for labeling tasks. Many previous works have studied the reliability of unknown workers for crowdsourcing tasks with a stochastic assumption. However, each worker's reliability varies when performing tasks with different categories. Meanwhile, the reliability of each worker is usually unknown and doesn't follow any stochastic distribution. In this paper, we propose an Adversarial multi-armed Bandit-base algorithm to handle the Unknown Worker Recruitment (ABUWR) problem without any prior stochastic assumption. In ABUWR, we determine suitable workers for each task to maximize the accumulated average accuracy of the labeling tasks under a limited budget.

The “mounting” action refers to a cattle's action where a cow bends over another cow usually when either cow is in estrus. Although a pattern recognition-based approach for detecting such an action would be appreciated as being low-cost and robust, it had not been discussed much due to the complexity of the system architecture, unavailability of datasets, etc. This study presents i) our image dataset construction technique that exploits both object detection algorithm and crowdsourcing for collecting cattle pair images with labels of either “mounting” or not; and ii) a system for detecting the mounting action from any given image of a cattle pair, developed based on the dataset. Starting with an algorithm for extracting regions of cattle pairs from a video frame based on intersection of single cattle regions, we then designed our crowdsourcing microtask in which crowd workers were given simple guidelines to annotate mounting-action-relevant labels to the extracted regions, to finally obtain a dataset. We also introduce our tandem-layered pattern recognition system trained with the dataset. The system is comprised of two serially-connected machine learning components, and is capable of more robustly detecting mounting actions even with a small amount of training data than a normal end-to-end neural network. Experimental comparisons demonstrated that our detection system was capable of detecting estrus with a precision rate of 80% and a recall rate of 76%.","1051-4651","978-1-7281-8808-9","10.1109/ICPR48806.2021.9412975","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9412975","","Crowdsourcing;Image recognition;Neural networks;Buildings;Training data;Systems architecture;Object detection","","","","23","IEEE","5 May 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Multi-destination people, who have many intermediate locations to visit before the final destination, e.g., couriers and tourists, are ideal recruitment candidates to conduct sensing tasks since they spend more time outside and have a wide spatio-temporal distribution. However, existing spatial crowdsourcing methods are only designed for workers who have single destinations, e.g., commuters, which are not applicable to recruit the multiple-destination people. Therefore, in this paper, we generalize the urban crowdsensing problem to the multi-destination scenario, namely, Urban Sensing for Multi-Destination Workers (USMDW). We prove its NP-hardness, and propose a framework Urban Sensing for Multi-destination Workers via Deep REinforcement learning, i.e., SMORE, to solve it effectively and efficiently. SMORE is composed of two steps: 1) candidate assignment initialization, which initializes all feasible sensing task-worker assignment pairs by a pre-trained reinforcement learning-based working route planning solver; and 2) reinforcement learning-based iterative selection, which iteratively selects a sensing task-worker pair to the current assignment via a novel policy network, i.e., Two-stage Assignment Selection Network (TASNet).

If the crowdsourcing is continuously conducted, the observation time of the radio environment and registered data size may be enormous according to the area size. Thus, we propose two methods for determining the required sample size to estimate the average received signal power. In the first method, the interval estimation and central limit theorem are utilized to estimate the required sample size in each mesh. As the second method, the t-test in hypothesis testing is used.

Some of the measurements include associated location data, whereas a large number do not. This situation led us to represent the data as a graph, capturing the inherent spatial structure of Wi-Fi scan data. We define a subset of Access Points (APs) as “anchor nodes” and estimate their positions using a generalized least squares (GLS) estimator. We then employ a force-directed graph layout algorithm to lay-out the remaining APs in relation to the anchor nodes. The resulting graph layout provides a visualization of the entire dataset, which is inherently useful for further investigations, such as identifying where future data collection campaigns should be targeted.","","978-1-5090-5922-5","10.1109/EURONAV.2017.7954225","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7954225","","Wireless fidelity;Data visualization;Layout;Position measurement;Mobile handsets;Data collection;Buildings","","","","11","IEEE","22 Jun 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Since the representations of the same entity vary, it is often impossible to fully automate the entity matching and require human inputs. However, to guarantee high-quality entity matching, how to integrate human resources into the entity matching while minimizing the cost of human resources? In this paper, we propose BUBBLE, a novel human-in-the-loop entity matching framework hybridizing Bayesian inference and crowdsourcing. To guarantee entity matching quality, Bayesian inference is conducted to determine whether the matching requires crowdsourcing. We show that we can define Bayesian error rate for this problem. For optimization, we use metric learning to select the candidate matching pairs by nearest-neighbor search in the learned embedding space, and we construct a k-nearest neighbor graph to avoid the redundant matching.

Among these, store signboards are one of the most important structuring elements for constructing pleasant urban landscapes. Since effective store signboards are usually informational and visually appealing, it is essential to consider both the artistic and informational aspects when designing store signboards. In this paper, we propose a new computational model that evaluates the effectiveness of commercial signboard design in terms of aesthetics, memorability, and saliency as criteria. Our proposed model consists of two steps: crowdsourcing and prediction. In the crowdsourcing phase, we conduct multi-modal cascaded test to evaluate the effectiveness of signboards. In the prediction phase, we propose a modified Capsule Network (CapsNet) for computing the effectiveness score of a commercial signboard. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed system shows reasonable performance with a RMSE of 0.0721 in terms of predicting effectiveness score for a given commercial signboard.","","978-1-7281-5606-4","10.1109/ISM46123.2019.00027","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8959046","signboard design;deep learning;crowdsourcing","","","","","11","IEEE","16 Jan 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To achieve it, it is necessary to map the mobile camera images to the GIS image database. However, it is difficult to estimate the direct correspondence because most of the mobile camera images are landscape images, and the perspective of the ground area differs significantly. In contrast, GIS image data contain directly downward images. If the cameras' internal parameters and the posture at the shooting are known, it is possible to convert the image to top-view. However, considering the premise of crowdsourcing image collection, these parameters are not necessarily known. Therefore, we develop a method to correct the perspective distortion of the ground area in the image and convert it to a top-eye view even when the camera parameters are unknown.","","978-1-6654-3902-2","10.1109/BigData52589.2021.9671735","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9671735","geometric correction;intrinsic parameters;geographic information system;deep learning","Crowdsourcing;Training;Parameter estimation;Image databases;Conferences;Information sharing;Big Data","","","","7","IEEE","13 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Specifically, Our HaCAIE can be decomposed into three phases: $i$) seeking full semantic relations among entities, where HaCAIE models multiple explicit and implicit semantic relations among labelers, tasks and categories, based on homogeneous information network and related techniques; ii) calculating homophily, where HaCAIE utilizes adjacent relation matrices of labelers and tasks to calculate homophily among labelers; and iii) correcting labels, where for each task, HaCAIE employs information entropy and constructs a corresponding star homophily network to perform label correction.

Fortunately, crowdsourcing based bathymetry provides a cheap and fast solution to obtain enough soundings for describing something of the great variety of the silt deposition and river bed deformation. However, these unprofessional data must undergo significant quality control measures to improve data quality. In this paper, the fusion of some independent repeating soundings measured by crowdsourcing is discussed.

The said data is based on the public location database provided by Foursquare service. The database contains huge records of locations data for venues and landmarks worldwide. In this paper we show how the said database could provide accurate representations for locations coordinates that is query to it. We collected location parameters from various points around a certain area. Then using the custom made prototype that is based on a location based crowdsourcing API, we attempt to compare the results shown by the service with actual locations. Given the set of locations it is shown that it is possible to accurately detect 85% of these locations using the said crowd-sourced based location service given certain parameters. However, we detected that crowdsourced data do not provide a complete set of locations a secondary alternative is proposed.

In this work, we focus on crowd consensus estimation of continuous labels using a probabilistic approach. A lot of existing work is reported for annotator behavior modeling for the categorical case; however, there is limited work in the continuous case. We propose a maximum-likelihood solution to determine the estimated consensus while simultaneously modeling the behavior of various annotators. Further, to handle the long-tail phenomena commonly observed in crowdsourced datasets, a confidence-interval based estimated consensus is derived.

Comparing these models with primary crowdsourcing data revealed that the models can annotate better than humans by 9.7% when measuring the localisation error while taking into account both false positives (FPs) and false negatives (FNs).

However, due to diversity of crowdsourcing workers and fluctuation of the number of tasks assigned to each worker, inferring stable and reliable clusters is challenging. Moreover, an item may be associated with multiple attributes, and such items should be put into different clusters, which makes inferring accurate clusters more complicated. To address the challenges above, in this paper we present a robust and fast crowdclustering scheme for finding overlapping clusters of items. Distinguished from existing works, we extract reliable and stable cluster information from workers' answers by majority voting. We then formulate an optimization problem to find overlapping clusters, and develop a nonnegative matrix factorization based approach to approximate the optimal solution.

The fact that the creators of crowdsourcing programmes may easily determine users’ location data, traffic data, motor vehicle details, environmental information, etc., raises major sensitivity personal data privacy concerns for users. The cost of connectivity here between vehicles and the cloud server also considerably rises as the number of cars grows. In this research, we propose federated learning with local differential privacy integration to support machine learning model development in crowdsourcing applications while minimising privacy risks and reducing communication costs. We explicitly recommend using four LDP approaches to disrupt slopes caused by moving vehicles. The proposed Three-Outputs method provides three different output options to achieve a high accuracy when the private budget is constrained. The output options of 3 can be coded with just two bits to reduce transmission expenses. Additionally, when the privacy cost is significant, a perfect piecewise approach is recommended to maximise performance. In addition, we provide a suboptimal method with a simple formula and comparable utility to PM-OPT. Then, we develop a completely new hybrid mechanism by fusing Three-Outputs with PM-SUB. In order to synchronise the cars and cloud server for collaborative model training, an LDP-FedSGD technique is suggested. Extensive experiments on real data sets support the possibility that our suggested methods could safeguard privacy while maintaining value.","","978-1-6654-5046-1","10.1109/INCOFT55651.2022.10094522","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10094522","IoT;Crowd Sensing;Data Privacy;Hybrid Technique;Differential Privacy","Training;Privacy;Differential privacy;Cloud computing;Costs;Sensitivity;Sensors","","","","20","IEEE","13 Apr 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

How to reasonably allocate tasks to workers in a dynamic environment to maximize the platform utility has become a research hotspot. Many past works have made great efforts in this regard, but most of them only consider the long-term constraints of resources, and ignore the short-term ability constraints of workers to provide resources. In this paper, we consider a platform-centered online spatiotemporal crowdsourcing system, where mobile workers have long-term and short-term resource constraints, while the platform has a long-term budget constraint. We aim to find an online worker scheduling scheme to maximize the platform’s long-term utility without violating the constraints of workers and the platform. To address the problem, we first transform the long-term utility maximization problem into a real-time utility maximization problem by leveraging the Lyapunov optimization. Then, we design a centralized algorithm based on Markov approximation to solve the real-time optimization problem. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our proposed approach can achieve near-optimal performance for our problem.

Even in the set of labeled test cases, there is still an uneven distribution of labels. To address the difficulties mentioned above, this paper proposes a test case classification framework based on Few-shot Learning. The framework augments test cases and extracts relevant information for vectorization, collects the category lexicon of test cases using the BiLSTM model, and finally classifies the test cases.

When developers invoke API methods in a framework, they often encounter obstacles in finding the correct usage of the API, let alone to employ best practices. Previous research addresses this line of questions by mining API usage patterns to induce API usage templates, by conducting and compiling interviews of developers, and by inferring correlations among APIs. In this paper, we analyze API-related posts regarding iOS and Android development from a Q&A Web site, stackoverflow.com. Assuming that API-related posts are primarily about API usage obstacles, we find several iOS and Android API classes that appear to be particularly likely to challenge developers, even after we factor out API usage hotspots, inferred by modelling API usage of open source iOS and Android applications. For each API with usage obstacles, we further apply a topic mining tool to posts that are tagged with the API, and we discover several repetitive scenarios in which API usage obstacles occur. We consider our work as a stepping stone towards understanding API usage challenges based on forum-based input from a multitude of developers, input that is prohibitively expensive to collect through interviews. Our method helps to motivate future research in API usage, and can allow designers of platforms - such as iOS and Android - to better understand the problems developers have in using their platforms, and to make corresponding improvements.","2160-1860","978-1-4673-2936-1","10.1109/MSR.2013.6624006","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6624006","","Androids;Humanoid robots;Software;Software engineering;Libraries;Documentation;Data mining","","43","","17","IEEE","10 Oct 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
