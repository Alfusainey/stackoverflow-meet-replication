Each revolution has fundamentally transformed hearing aids and pushed the entire industry forward significantly. Machine learning has received significant attention in recent years and has been applied in many other industries, e.g., robotics, speech recognition, genetics, and crowdsourcing. We argue that the next revolution in hearing aids is machine intelligence. In fact, this revolution is already quietly happening. We will review the development in at least three major areas: applications of machine learning in speech enhancement; applications of machine learning in individualization and customization of signal processing algorithms; applications of machine learning in improving the efficiency and effectiveness of clinical tests.

The current study explores whether CV trajectory data (based on the crowdsourcing of timestamped vehicle and mobile device locations) can currently be used for this purpose. The study compares in-pavement detector data with “virtual” detector line data based on geo-fencing of trajectory splines. The Purdue Coordination Diagram (PCD), arrival flow profile, and cumulative arrival performance measures are used to assess and compare both data sources. The comparisons indicate that percent on green (POG) estimates from CV trajectories come within 0.1 to 15.7% of the in-pavement detector data, with the highest accuracy attributing to time-of-day periods with moderate traffic and high POG.

In this work we focus on a detailed analysis of the effects of camera shakes, harmful occlusions as well as a possible misalignment between the recording camera and the scene, on the resulting video quality. In contrast, most of the video quality discussion in the literature has focused on encoding artifacts and other compression problems.

The model links the technical concern of Quality of Service (QoS) to the relevant 5G service experience on each of 5G scenarios. It utilizes the crowdsourcing service quality assessment on the three characteristics. First, it signifies the 5G service applications underlying enhanced multimedia broadband scenario which is differentiated by location-related two cases, i.e. the hotspot area and wide area coverage. Second, the model signifies the 5G service underlying the ultra-reliable and low-latency communications which is focusing on QoS parameters, i.e. latency, reliability and availability. Third, the developed model emphasizes energy efficiency implication on the scenario of massive-machine type communications.

If the desired target distribution is uniform, then the effect is balancing: all values across all different dimensions are equally represented. Other types of target distributions can also be specified, depending on the nature of the problem. The proposed approach may be used in machine learning, for shaping training and testing datasets, or in crowdsourcing, for preparing datasets of a manageable size.","2381-8549","978-1-4673-9961-6","10.1109/ICIP.2016.7533061","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7533061","Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP);datasets;balancing;crowdsourcing","Head;Crowdsourcing;Optimization;Training;Mixed integer linear programming;Visualization;Information technology","","9","","14","IEEE","19 Aug 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The absence of an adequate test suite or using tests of low quality can degrade the quality of the software product. We present an approach for reducing the effort required by project owners for extending their test suites. We aim to utilize the phenomenon of drive-by commits: capable users quickly and easily solve problems in others' projects - even though they are not particularly involved in that project - and move on. By analyzing and directing the drive-by commit phenomenon, we hope to use crowdsourcing to improve projects' quality assurance efforts.

Given a set of popular Twitter events along with different credibility ratings assigned manually by human annotators (i.e., crowdsourcing), we study the problem of automatically assessing the credibility of such events.

A high quality solution requires a worker to exert effort; a platform can motivate such effort exertion and truthful reporting by providing a reward. We propose a novel rewarding mechanism based on using a truth detection technology, which can verify the correctness of workers' responses to questions with an imperfect accuracy (e.g., questions regarding whether the workers exert effort finishing the tasks and whether they truthfully report their solutions). We model the interactions between the platform and workers as a two-stage Stackelberg game. In Stage I, the platform optimizes the reward design associated with truth detection to maximize its payoff. In Stage II, the workers decide their effort levels and reporting strategies to maximize their payoffs (which depend on the output of the truth detection). We analyze the game's equilibrium and show that as the truth detection accuracy improves, the platform should incentivize more workers to exert effort finishing the tasks and truthfully report their solutions. Moreover, our mechanism performs well even when the detection accuracy is not very high. A 60% accurate detection can yield a platform payoff that is more than 85% of the maximum achieved under perfect (100% accurate) detection.","","978-1-7281-2723-1","10.1109/GlobalSIP45357.2019.8969240","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8969240","","Task analysis;Crowdsourcing;Games;Detectors;Robot kinematics","","9","","21","IEEE","28 Jan 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We address this problem by presenting a semi-supervised training method for neural networks with true-class and pseudo-class (un-annotated class) labels on partially annotated training data. The true-class labels are supervised annotations from clinical professionals. The pseudo-class labels are unsupervised clustering of un-annotated data.

We validated our method on extra-coronary calcification detection in low dose CT scans.

Relying on independent anonymous help givers can expand the resource availability and facilitate help provisioning. Further, Crowdsourcing can be a valuable source of information that can better guide help provisioning process. However, establishing dynamic trust relationship between help requesters, information providers, and help givers is the key enabler to such enhancement. Help requests should be probably authenticated not to waste the valuable resources, help provisioning should be rewarded to motivate help givers, and Data sharing should be verified not to act on false information.

In this context, vehicle detection generates a great deal of interest in the scientific and industrial community. Indeed, detecting vehicles can have a range of applications from traffic monitoring to parking lots occupancy rate estimation. This interest is demonstrated in the wide range of public vehicle datasets that already exist. However, these datasets rely on the use of aerial images, acquired from planes, that are different in many aspects from satellite images. Machine learning algorithms trained on these datasets are therefore likely to underperform on satellite images. Therefore, we introduce a large-scale dataset for VEHicle detection on SATellite images (VehSat). To this end, we collected 4544 crops of satellite images, from 4 different satellites and on 8 different areas. In total, 36851 vehicles were annotated in various contexts and resolutions. To build a baseline for vehicle detection in satellite images, we also evaluate state-of-the-art object detection algorithms on VehSat.

In this paper, we make use of the crowd to achieve high quality data fusion result. We design a framework selecting a set of tasks to ask crowds in order to improve the confidence of data. Since data are correlated and crowds may provide incorrect answers, how to select a proper set of tasks to ask the crowd is a very challenging problem. In this paper, we design an approximation solution to address this challenge since we prove that the problem is at NP-hard.

The pervasiveness of mobile devices has taken citizen sensing to unprecedented levels of adoption, as anyone with a phone can easily participate. However, especially when the collected data must be processed and analyzed by domain experts (such as municipal authorities), the flow of records is only useful if it does not exceed the receiving entity's capacity to process it. In this paper, we therefore envision and discuss the use of 2-Tier Citizen Sensing applications to mitigate this problem: In a first step (tier 1), data is collected by citizens in a crowdsourced fashion. In a second step (tier 2) the collected data is pre-processed by the crowd in a collaborative environment with aid of data mining algorithms, e.g. by aggregating redundant submitted records. The resulting reduced data can then be faster processed by domain experts. We evaluate this approach on data from an existing prototype of a tier-2 participatory urban infrastructure monitoring platform for civic issue reporting. By applying sentiment analysis algorithms on a large corpus of experience reviews (from 282 crowd-workers) we found relevant correlations between users' review sentiment scores and their performance on the crowd-working tasks. We show how these findings can be exploited to design better crowdsourcing platforms and discuss how citizens, domain experts and municipal authorities can benefit from such two-tier citizen sensing systems.","","978-1-5090-1846-8","10.1109/ISC2.2016.7580771","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7580771","","Sensors;Correlation;Data mining;Sentiment analysis;Urban areas;Crowdsourcing;Collaboration","","6","","13","IEEE","3 Oct 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Four types of musical elements (music structure, hierarchical beat structure, melody line, and chords) have been automatically annotated for more than 920,000 songs on music-or video-sharing services and can readily be used by music-synchronized applications. Since errors are inevitable when elements are annotated automatically, Songle Widget takes advantage of a user-friendly crowdsourcing interface that enables users to correct them.

These revolve around the choice of platform strategy, which should handle aspects such as the provision of Application Programming Interfaces (API), privacy and security concerns and how open access to data should be. This paper examines design issues for developing a digital ecosystem for municipal organizations by considering the opportunities presented by Big Data. The main focus is to suggest solutions for the deployment of an envisioned Smart Pedestrian Network (SPN) system. The proposed solution combines multiple subsystems, such as Geographical Information Systems, intelligent agents, sensor systems, crowdsourcing, and social networks to create an integrated big data approach for the urban environment. Such an ecosystem is exceptionally useful for the effective involvement of municipality stakeholders, such as members of the public community, management, city planning, public works maintenance teams as well as local businesses.","","978-1-7281-1929-8","10.1109/EECS.2018.00058","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8910030","Platform Strategies;Crowdsourcing;Big Data;Smart Cities;Intelligent Systems;Municipal Organizations","Big Data;Urban areas;Social networking (online);Organizations;Ecosystems;Sensors;Data privacy","","5","","17","IEEE","25 Nov 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The researchers aim to develop a real-time road traffic information system by using the traffic-related tweets from MMDA (Metropolitan Manila Development Authority) official Twitter account to aid the current problem of providing sufficient road traffic information in the country. In this research, the traffic-related tweets from MMDA data are fetched using Twitter Streaming API, filtered by using Named Entity Recognition, preprocessed by applying tokenization, frequency counting and removal of unnecessary symbols, features were extracted by using Latent Dirichlet Allocation to identify the significant topic segments (time, day, lane of road, road direction, location and traffic mode) and Linear Regression was used for pattern recognition. Also, this study compares four machine learning algorithms (Naïve Bayes, Decision Tree, Random Tree, and k-Nearest Neighbor) for the proper identification of the most effective algorithm that will be used to for traffic mode classification. The experimental result shows that k-NN produced the best performance compared to other algorithms with 84.00% classification accuracy in anticipating the traffic congestion modes (Light, Light to Moderate, Moderate, Moderate to Heavy, and Heavy) in Metro Manila, Philippines.","","978-1-5386-7767-4","10.1109/HNICEM.2018.8666416","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8666416","traffic congestion;real-time traffic detection;text mining techniques;road traffic system;Latent Dirichlet Allocation;Twitter Streaming API;Named Entity Recognition","Roads;Twitter;Traffic congestion;Feature extraction;Machine learning algorithms;Real-time systems;Classification algorithms","","5","","8","IEEE","14 Mar 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, it is well known that even human annotators do not agree on selecting most summary sentences. In this paper, we take a probabilistic view of the summarization ground-truth and assume that more frequently selected sentences by annotators are of higher importance. Using a large summary data-set obtained through crowdsourcing, we empirically show that sentence selection frequency is inversely related to its summarization rank. Consequently, we model the relative importance between sentences using a rank-based classifier. Additionally, we utilize an extended paralinguistic feature set that has not been previously used for speech summarization. Lexical and structural features are also included. Support Vector Machine (SVM) is used as the baseline binary classifier and rank classifier.

Many surveillance applications rely on data exchange and image transmission through the network. Moreover, with the widespread use of smart phones and social media, image exchange through crowdsourcing can provide invaluable information for surveillance and investigation purposes. However, transmission of images consumes significant amount of energy, and energy is a limited resource for wireless embedded devices. So far, not much attention has been paid to the energy consumption of a static or mobile node during image transmission for different scenarios. In this paper, we present a new approach for image transmission, which employs a relay node and decreases the overall energy consumption of the sender and the relay nodes. We have performed the experiments with actual wireless embedded smart cameras (CITRIC), with TelosB motes, for a static as well as a mobile scenario. We have compared the energy consumption of the proposed method with that of a traditional relay approach, and that of not using a relay node at all. Experimental results show that, with the proposed relay approach, the energy consumption of image transmission can be reduced by up to 16% in a mobile scenario.","","978-1-4799-4871-0","10.1109/AVSS.2014.6918645","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6918645","","Relays;Cameras;Receivers;Wireless communication;Image communication;Energy consumption;Wireless sensor networks","","5","","11","IEEE","9 Oct 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Due to the increased number of cars, drivers have to hunt around the streets and parking facilities searching for free parking spots. Consequently, there are concerns about traffic congestion as well as time consumption, fuel wasting, and air quality degradation due to the emission of the fine dust at residential areas and shopping districts. To alleviate the problems, we propose a connected car-based on-street parking location service system, in which the system consists of the parking space detection device (DD), the cloud server, and mobile application. Each of the cars in the system is equipped with a DD that acts as a mobile sensing unit (MSU). The proposed system is based on the concept of crowdsourcing; thus, each MSU is responsible for detecting the free parking location and transmitting the parking-related information (MSU id, MSU location, the width of detected free parking location) to the server through a wireless network. Later, a user (i.e., driver) can select a free parking location and navigate to its feasible parking location via a mobile application. However, when the system is unable to detect any free on-street parking location, it suggests users about off-street parking facilities near the user's intended destination.","","978-1-7281-2516-9","10.1109/IoTaIS47347.2019.8980443","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8980443","IoT;Connected-car;Smart cities;Smart parking;On-street parking;LTE;Crowdsourcing;Mobile application","Navigation;Wireless networks;Mobile applications;Sensors;Servers;Automobiles;Internet of Things","","4","","12","IEEE","6 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A particle filter is also used to fusion PDR and landmarks detection results for better localization performance. The experiments show that the proposed fusion algorithm achieved the accuracy of 3.15 m at 90% of the time with dense landmarks (1 landmark per 5 m), which performs 51.76% better than 6.53 m from PDR algorithm. With sparse landmarks (1 landmark per 15 m), the proposed fusion algorithm achieved the accuracy of 3.26 m at 90% of the time.

Currently there are no methods to inventorize landscape scenicness on a large scale. In this paper we study how to upscale local assessments of scenicness provided by human observers, and we do so by using satellite images. Moreover, we develop an explicitly interpretable CNN model that allows assessing the connections between landscape scenicness and the presence of specific landcover types. To generate the landscape scenicness ground truth, we use the ScenicOrNot crowdsourcing database, which provides geo-referenced, human-based scenicness estimates for ground based photos in Great Britain. Our results show that it is feasible to predict landscape scenicness based on satellite imagery. The interpretable model performs comparably to an unconstrained model, suggesting that it is possible to learn a semantic bottleneck that represents well the present landcover classes and still contains enough information to accurately predict the location's scenicness.","2153-7003","978-1-7281-6374-1","10.1109/IGARSS39084.2020.9323706","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9323706","Remote Sensing;Interpretability;Deep Learning;Scenicness;landcover;Explainable AI","Predictive models;Satellites;Task analysis;Semantics;Remote sensing;Correlation;Wetlands","","4","","17","IEEE","17 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Current lane-level vehicular localization systems require dedicated devices, making the systems difficult to popularize. Moreover, most systems depend heavily on continuous accurate GPS data, which may be interfered under specific environments. Efficient lane-level map building is another problem to deal with. In this paper, we propose an integrated system with the capability of map building and lane- level localization using smartphones. This system employs a crowdsourcing-based approach to collect information from multiple sensors (including GPS, orientation sensor and acceleration sensor), such as lane changes and turns. Based on the information, a lane localization schemes is designed using the tool of machine learning. The experimental results show that the proposed system achieves high accuracy of map building and lane-level localization.","","978-1-5090-1701-0","10.1109/VTCFall.2016.7881065","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7881065","","Global Positioning System;Acceleration;Support vector machines;Smart phones;Sensor systems;Automobiles","","3","","13","IEEE","20 Mar 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this work, we focus on the above scenario and investigate the level of accuracy that can be achieved in estimating the phenomenon of interest through a mobile crowdsourcing application. Specifically, we take a signal processing-based approach and leverage results on signal reconstruction from sets of irregularly spaced samples. We apply such results to a realistic scenario where samples are collected by vehicular and pedestrian users, and study the accuracy level of the phenomenon estimation as the penetration rate of the sensing application varies.","","978-1-4799-0749-6","10.1109/WONS.2013.6578316","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6578316","","Roads;Sensors;Accuracy;Mobile communication;Vehicles;Wireless communication","","3","","9","IEEE","15 Aug 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Although various neural networks were proposed for wake-word detection, less attention has been paid to efficient corpus design, which we address in this study. For this purpose, we collected speech data via a crowdsourcing platform and evaluated the performance of several neural networks when different subsets of the corpus were used for training. The results reveal the following requirements for efficient corpus design to produce a lower misdetection rate: (1) short segments of continuous speech can be used as negative samples, but they are not as effective as random words; (2) utterances of ""adversarial"" words, i.e., phonetically similar words to a wake-word, contribute to improving performance significantly when they are used as negative samples; (3) it is preferable for individual speakers to provide both positive and negative samples; (4) increasing the number of speakers is better than increasing the number of repetitions of a wake-word by each speaker.","","978-1-7281-7066-4","10.1109/SLT48900.2021.9383569","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9383569","wake-word detection;corpus design","Crowdsourcing;Training;Conferences;Neural networks;Natural languages;Training data;Speech synthesis","","3","","18","IEEE","25 Mar 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Infection of plants by pathogens can have serious consequences on plant health which inherently affects human health. With more than 80 percent of agricultural production done by smallholder farmers who depend on healthy crop yield for their livelihood, yield loss of more than 50 percent due to pests and diseases is reported. Currently, infectious diseases reduce the potential yield by an average of 40% with many farmers in the developing world experiencing yield losses as high as 100%. The widespread distribution of smartphones among crop growers around the world with an expected 5 billion smartphones by 2020 offers the potential of turning the smartphone into a valuable tool for diverse communities growing food. One potential application is the development of mobile disease diagnostics through machine learning and crowdsourcing. With the help of state of art technologies like deep learning and cloud computing, the same can be achieved on a real-time basis. With the help of Convolutional Neural Network architectures, a system is proposed that focuses on detection and identification of the plant disease with a mere click of leaf picture and provides solutions.","","978-1-7281-8876-8","10.1109/I2CT51068.2021.9418124","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9418124","Convolutional Neural Network architectures;Deep Learning models;Plant diseases;Python programming","Deep learning;Tools;Programming;Turning;Agriculture;Real-time systems;Convolutional neural networks","","3","","9","IEEE","10 May 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we present an expert discovery service that leverages the professional social network of an employee, who was previously known to hold the desired inventory information but is no longer available. Evaluation results suggest that this method reconstructs the desired information more than 80% of the time, as per our experiment involving 50 cases.
