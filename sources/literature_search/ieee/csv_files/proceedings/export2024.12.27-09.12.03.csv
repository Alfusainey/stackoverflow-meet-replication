This paper describes the first unified framework for converting legacy open data in image format into a machine-readable and reusable format by using crowdsourcing. Crowd workers are asked not only to extract data from an image of a chart but also to reproduce the chart objects in spreadsheets. The properties of the reconstructed chart objects give their data structures including series names and values, which are useful for automatic processing of data by computer. Since results produced by crowdsourcing inherently contain errors, a quality control mechanism was developed that improves the accuracy of extracted tables by aggregating tables created by different workers for the same chart image and by utilizing the data structures obtained from the reproduced chart objects. Experimental results demonstrated that the proposed framework and mechanism are effective.","","978-1-4673-8272-4","10.1109/DSAA.2015.7344801","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7344801","","Crowdsourcing;Data mining;Resource description framework;Software;Computers;Data structures;Licenses","","3","","20","IEEE","7 Dec 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The far-reaching of the World Wide Web has brought another method for communicating the assumptions of people. Web-based social networking is creating an immense measure of estimation rich information as tweets, status updates, blog entries, and so on. Sentiment analysis of this user-generated information is extremely helpful in knowing the opinion of the group. Twitter sentiment analysis is troublesome contrasted with general sentiment analysis because of the existence of slang words and incorrect spellings. It is additionally a medium with a tremendous measure of data where clients can see the opinion of different clients that are categorized into various sentiment classes and are progressively developing as a key factor in dynamic. In this paper, the Emotion Prediction approach has been established by collecting the real-time twitter data from the Twitter API, pre-processing the data and to predict the emotions using various Machine Learning algorithms. The proposed user emotion prediction approach can be used to predict the emotions of the user and the user emotion approach has been compared with the machine learning and sentiment classification algorithms. With the comparative study of the algorithm, the best accuracy can be analyzed for the user emotion analysis. The crowdsourcing system can be used for the Business systems to predict the popularity of their brands and to make changes in their brand according to the feedback received. This proposed Emotion Prediction approach is mainly focusing on working with a real-time Twitter dataset. With the evaluated accuracy measure the end-user can make a quick prediction in the usage of the crowdsourcing system.","","978-1-7281-5518-0","10.1109/ICOEI48184.2020.9143021","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9143021","User emotion prediction;user request data preprocessing;tweet analysis building;emotion sentiment classification","Twitter;Support vector machines;Real-time systems;Data mining;Sentiment analysis;Prediction algorithms;Conferences","","3","","21","IEEE","17 Jul 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Some frameworks have been successfully developed for crowdsourcing spatial tasks to a set of workers. Most of the current frameworks assume that all tasks belong to the same category and that workers are self-motivated to voluntarily perform tasks. However, the assumptions may not be practical in reality since different tasks may belong to different expertise and workers may not be self-incentivised to voluntarily perform tasks. In this paper, we introduce a reward-based approach for crowdsourcing spatial expert tasks (i.e., spatial tasks that are related to specific expertise). We formally define the Maximum Task Minimum Cost Assignment (MTMCA) problem and propose a solution for it. Subsequently, we perform various experiments to prove the usability and scalability of our approach as well as investigate factors that may effect the overall assignment.

However, the success of mobile crowdsourcing relies on balancing the supply and demand by first accurately forecasting spatially and temporally the supply-demand gap, and then providing efficient incentives to encourage participant movements to maintain the desired balance. In this paper, we propose Deep-Gap, a deep learning approach based on residual learning to predict the gap between mobile crowdsourced service supply and demand at a given time and space. The prediction can drive the incentive model to achieve a geographically balanced service coverage in order to avoid the case where some areas are over-supplied while other areas are under-supplied. This allows anticipating the supply-demand gap and redirecting crowdsourced service providers towards target areas. Deep-Gap relies on historical supply-demand time series data as well as available external data such as weather conditions and day type (e.g., weekday, weekend, holiday). First, we roll and encode the time series of supplydemand as images using the Gramian Angular Summation Field (GASF), Gramian Angular Difference Field (GADF) and the Recurrence Plot (REC). These images are then used to train deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to extract the low and high-level features and forecast the crowdsourced services gap. We conduct comprehensive comparative study by establishing two supply-demand gap forecasting scenarios: with and without external data. Compared to state-of-art approaches, Deep-Gap achieves the lowest forecasting errors in both scenarios.","2330-2186","978-1-7281-5011-6","10.1109/CloudCom.2019.00048","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8968896","Crowdsourced service, Supply-demand gap, Time series, Gramian Angular Field, Recurrence Plot, Residual learning","","","3","","24","IEEE","28 Jan 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In order to stabilize the mobile crowdsourcing at a massive scale, incentive mechanisms are needed not only to stimulate the users of mobile phones to participate in sensing, but also to incentivize the organizer of the sensing tasks with maximum service time and payoff. In this paper, we study a practical problem in mobile sensing, i.e., sensing time uncertainty, which may lead to failures of existing incentive mechanisms. In particular, we model this problem as a perturbed Stackelberg game in which mobile phone users may actually conduct sensing tasks during different periods of time rather than what they intend, like through a trembling hand. We find that there exist Trembling-Hand Perfect Equilibria (THP) given proper rewards. After characterizing THPs in this game with rigorous analysis, we design incentive mechanisms that can achieve a THP with the maximum system wide total sensing time and maximum platform utility. We finally verify the correctness and efficiency of our proposed incentive mechanisms and algorithms through extensive experiments.","1938-1883","978-1-4673-6432-4","10.1109/ICC.2015.7248874","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7248874","","Sensors;Uncertainty;Games;Crowdsourcing;Mobile handsets;Mobile communication;Algorithm design and analysis","","3","","36","IEEE","10 Sep 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To deal with the problem that labels collected from crowds are usually noisy due to the low accuracy of non-expert online workers, we use quality control methods to improve the qualities of crowd data. Unfortunately, current quality control methods only consider the instance difficulty or the worker reliability to account for the variety of labels to the same instance, and these methods did not take subjectivity of workers into consideration which also effects the responses. In this paper, we present a novel subjectivity-aware algorithm for label aggregation, which also model the difficulty of instances and reliability of workers as latent parameters. This method is an EM-like algorithm, which not only infers the ground truth of the instances, but also simultaneously estimates the latent parameters.

In this paper, we ensure security in mobile crowdsourcing and maximize the utility (incorporating both credibility and power consumption) by provisioning secure transmission rate to each user based on power selection and reporting format selection, considering current channel condition. We propose an online decision algorithm, called FLAPO (Format Selection and Power Control for Credibility Optimization), to optimally choose report format and secrecy rate optimization whenever an event takes place. Leveraging the recently developed Lyapunov optimization technique, we prove that FLAPO achieves the close-to-optimal system utility while bounding the average queue backlog (which translates into average reporting delays).

We combine the good properties in aforementioned schemes and propose 'Chance-Choice', a lightweight distributed load balancing scheme for selfish users with fast convergence property. We find that, even with limited information, the balancing performance could be improved significantly, under the rule of opportunistic offloading and selfish behavior. Extensive evaluations have been made to show that, 'Chance-Choice' outperforms several existing algorithms.

This paper addresses the efficient worker recruitment problem under the task coverage constraint. The efficiency of worker recruitment is measured by the total quality collected by a set of workers and the corresponding cost, e.g., proportional to the overall trajectory length of workers. Specifically, we consider two different scenarios, 1-D line topology and general 2-D topology, in which workers may have either homogeneous or heterogeneous crowdsourcing quality (e.g., the quality of videos or photos for an object at a particular location). In the 1-D scenario, we propose two dynamic programming approaches to find the optimal solution in both homogeneous and heterogeneous cases. In the general 2-D scenario, the proposed problem turns out to be NP-hard even in the homogeneous case. We first prove that the simple nearest assignment has an approximation ratio of 1/(2n), where n is the number of the workers. Therefore, the nearest assignment cannot be scalable. We further propose a novel assignment approach based on the minimum spanning tree. The proposed approach is proved to be close to the optimal solution in the homogeneous case and 1/ρ in the heterogeneous case, where ρ is the maximum quality ratio between two workers.

To address this fundamental challenge, many redundancy-based ground truth inference algorithms have been proposed in the past few years, which assign each labeling task to multiple workers and infer the true label of each instance in task from its multiple label set. In this paper, we devise a novel scheme to improve the quality of labeled data and infer the truth label, which utilizes small proportion golden data that has been labeled correctly to estimate workers' ability and reliability and uses the incentive mechanism to motivate workers to do their best.

Particularly, the workers come one after another to the crowdsourcing platform and meanwhile the platform makes irrevocable decision to select the qualified workers to the winner set and give them monetary reward. We formulate the incentive mechanism as a knapsack secretary auction, where we take advantages of the principles of solving knapsack problem and secretary problem to tackle the budget constraint and online scenario in our case.

Crowdsourcing platforms have the potential to integrate (entity matching, entity resolution) and analyze (sentiment analysis, image recognition) heterogeneous data sources when in some cases these integration tasks may prove to be problematic for computers.

For a beneficial budgeting plan to be made for civil engineering infrastructure maintenance and projects, a local government needs first to know the condition of its infrastructure. Without such information, it is not possible to create a plan that will use funds effectively and address the needs and desires of the community members. For larger bodies, like state governments or populous cities, collecting this information is achievable through the dedication of workforce and surveyors. However, smaller municipalities can often lack the funds and the resources. Consequently, this will foster reactive management of public infrastructure such that information is collected after an issue occurs and becomes major rather than minor, so repairs can be more expensive if the damage is significant. This only applies more strain to the limited budgets. To solve this issue, crowdsourcing information about the condition of public infrastructure from the community in the municipality can be used. Therefore, we developed a crowdsourcing based system to address this issue. The data will be collected through the use of public software that will seek to collect data and encourage users to report about all issues-, not just severe or significant damages. By receiving reports about all issues, regardless of severity, municipalities will have the information not only to react to and fix the damage, but also they may proactively predict, repair, and prevent severe damages based on timelines of reports about more minor issues. Moreover, upon the adaptation of this method proves to be helpful, this research aims to produce and deploy such software to benefit smaller municipalities.","1949-4106","978-1-6654-2386-1","10.1109/HONET53078.2021.9615483","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9615483","crowdsourcing;design;reporting;infrastructure","Crowdsourcing;Local government;Smart cities;Conferences;Public infrastructure;Maintenance engineering;Software","","2","","18","IEEE","30 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

When state-of-the-art automated methods are found to produce inaccurate boundaries, interactive segmentation can be effective. Since the inclusion of domain experts is typically expensive and does not scale, crowdsourcing has been considered. Due to concerns about the quality of crowd work, quality control methods that rely on a fixed number of redundant annotations have been used. We here introduce a collection strategy that dynamically assesses the quality of crowd work. We propose ICORD (Intelligent Collection Of Redundant annotation Data), a system that predicts the accuracy of a segmented region from analysis of (1) its geometric and intensity-based features and (2) the crowd worker's behavioral features. Based on this score, ICORD dynamically determines if the annotation accuracy is satisfactory or if a higher-quality annotation should be sought out in another round of crowdsourcing. We tested ICORD on phase contrast and fluorescence images of 270 cells. We compared the performance of ICORD and a popular baseline method for which we aggregated 1,350 crowd-drawn cell segmentations. Our results show that ICORD collects annotations both accurately and efficiently. Accuracy levels are within 3 percentage points of those of the baseline. More importantly, due to its dynamic nature, ICORD vastly outperforms the baseline method with respect to efficiency. ICORD only uses between 27% and 50% of the resources, i.e., collection time and cost, that the baseline method requires.","2160-7516","978-1-5090-1437-8","10.1109/CVPRW.2016.174","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7789664","","Image segmentation;Feature extraction;Crowdsourcing;Predictive models;Microscopy;Training data","","2","1","29","IEEE","19 Dec 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Despite its significance, the traditional signal map construction, e.g., through full site survey, could be time-consuming and labor-intensive as the signal varies frequently over time and the accuracy requirement grows rapidly with the emergence of new applications. Even with crowdsourcing scheme, the participants tend to be unevenly distributed in space while the encouragement budgets for the participants could be far from enough to collect adequate high-quality measurements. Therefore, the signal map constructed by crowdsourcing is often sparse and incomplete. To this end, in this paper, we study how to effectively reconstruct and update the signal map in the case of partially measured signal maps with minimum cost and propose an auto-encoder-based active signal map reconstruction method (AER). Our method is mainly innovative in three parts. Firstly, AER can effectively update the signal map with only a small number of observations while also fully using the incomplete historical signals to effectively update the signal map online. Secondly, AER consists of an active query mechanism which quantitatively evaluates the most valuable measurement site for reconstruction, which further reduces the measurement cost to a large extent. Thirdly, to cope with the measurement dynamics, we give a new signal map model describing not only the signal strength but also the signal dynamics, based on which an advanced AER algorithm is proposed.

In this paper, we investigate the crowdsourcing platform utility maximization by finding the optimal pricing policy for requested tasks. Such a pricing strategy can be formulated as a finite sum optimization problem in which the nodes try to achieve a global consensus on the pricing policy of each task. During the process of optimization, however, some nodes may be in the sleeping mode so that they cannot perform instantaneous updates, and it is too time-and resource-consuming to proceed synchronously centralized optimization due to the large scale networks. To address this issue, we use the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) type algorithm nonconvex primal-dual splitting with exact minimization (NESTT-E) to solve the optimization problem distributedly and asynchronously. Numerical results show the NESTT-E is more efficient than synchronous ADMM and conventional SGD with a larger number of working nodes.","","978-1-5386-7864-0","10.1109/ICCS.2018.8689251","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8689251","Crowdsourcing;Internet of Things;Task Pricing;Finite sum optimization;Stochastic gradient descent","","","1","","16","IEEE","14 Apr 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we propose CoMap, a new crowdsourcing high definition (HD) map to minimize the monetary cost of network resource usage while satisfying the percentile requirement of end-to-end latency. We design a novel CROP algorithm to learn the resource demands of CAV offloading, optimize offloading decisions, and proactively allocate temporal network resources in a fully distributed manner. In particular, we create a prediction model to estimate the uncertainty of resource demands based on Bayesian neural networks and develop a utilization balancing scheme to resolve the imbalanced resource utilization in individual infrastructures. We evaluate the performance of CoMap with extensive simulations in an automotive edge computing network simulator. The results show that CoMap reduces up to 80.4% average resource usage as compared to existing solutions.","1938-1883","978-1-5386-7462-8","10.1109/ICC45041.2023.10278954","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10278954","Crowdsourcing HD Map;Automotive Edge Computing;Vehicular Offloading;Resource Allocation","Crowdsourcing;Uncertainty;Computational modeling;Roads;Crops;Predictive models;Resource management","","1","","19","IEEE","23 Oct 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The proposed algorithm consists of two querying methods: One is efficiently identifying leader candidates in social network while the other focuses on optimized for interaction costs and labour costs of the expert team. The first method use betweenness centrality based on subgraph connectors that effectively reduce computational cost for ranking the leader candidates. On the other hand, the second method can identify collaborative partners by combining Skyline and precomputed interaction distance from reference points in social graphs.

It is used as preprocessing in numerous applications such as speech recognition, hearing aids, broadcasting and telephony. The evaluation of such algorithms often relies on reference-based objective metrics that are shown to correlate poorly with human perception. In order to evaluate audio quality as perceived by human observers it is thus fundamental to resort to subjective quality assessment and in doing so we identify subgroups of users where the subjective assessments correlate better to objective metrics. In this paper, a user evaluation based on crowdsourcing (subjective) and the Comparison Category Rating (CCR) method is compared against the DNS-MOS, ViSQOL and 3QUEST (objective) metrics. The overall quality scores of three speech enhancement algorithms from real time communications (RTC) are used in the comparison using the P.808 toolkit. Results indicate that while the CCR scale allows participants to identify differences between processed and unprocessed audio samples, two groups of preferences emerge: some users rate positively by focusing on noise suppression processing, while others rate negatively by focusing mainly on speech quality. We further present results on the parameters, size considerations and speaker variations that are critical and should be considered when designing the CCR-based crowdsourcing evaluation1.","2379-190X","978-1-7281-6327-7","10.1109/ICASSP49357.2023.10096447","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10096447","Speech Quality;Objective Metric;Subjective Evaluation;Crowdsourcing;P.808;Speech Enhancement","Crowdsourcing;Correlation;Noise reduction;Focusing;Signal processing algorithms;Speech recognition;Speech enhancement","","1","","26","IEEE","5 May 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Consequently, an online task assignment mechanism based on the labeler expertise and question heterogeneousness becomes necessary. In this paper, we present such an online task assignment algorithm based on a probabilistic model consisting of both labeler abilities and question difficulties.

It is difficult to learn from biased users' reviews to infer actual service state, as the service state can also be extreme and the platform cannot verify immediately. Further, due to the anonymity, reviewers can hide their bias types (positive or negative) from the platform and adaptively adjust their reviews against the platform's inference. To our best knowledge, we are the first to study how to save crowdsourcing from cheap-talk and strategically learn the actual service state from biased users' reviews. We formulate the problem as a dynamic Bayesian game, including the unknown users' messaging and the platform's follow-up inference. Through involved analysis, we provide closed-form expressions for the Perfect Bayesian Equilibrium (PBE). Our PBE shows that the platform's strategic learning can successfully prevent biased users from cheap-talk in most cases, where a user even with extreme bias still honestly messages to convince the platform of listening to his review. We prove that the price of anarchy (PoA) is 2, telling that the social cost can at most be doubled in the worst-case. As the user number becomes large, our platform always learns the actual service state. Perhaps surprisingly, the platform's expected cost may be worse off after adding one more user.","2690-3342","978-3-903176-55-3","10.23919/WiOpt58741.2023.10349706","Ministry of Education; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10349706","crowdsourcing;cheap-talk;dynamic Bayesian game;strategic learning","Crowdsourcing;Costs;Closed-form solutions;Wireless networks;Games;Bayes methods;Optimization","","1","","22","","22 Dec 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Using this technique, we have developed an online music-listening service called Songle that can help users better understand music by visualizing automatically estimated vocal regions and pitches of arbitrary songs existing on the Web. The accuracy of VAD is limited, however, because in general the acoustic characteristics of the training set are different from those of real songs on the Web. To overcome this limitation, we adapt a classifier by leveraging vocal regions and pitches corrected by volunteer users. UnlikeWikipedia-type crowdsourcing, our Songle-based framework can amplify user contributions: error corrections made for a limited number of songs improve VAD for all songs. This gives better music listening experiences to all users as non-monetary rewards.","2379-190X","978-1-4799-2893-4","10.1109/ICASSP.2014.6853671","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6853671","Music signal analysis;vocal activity detection;melody extraction;probabilistic models;crowdsourcing","Feature extraction;Multiple signal classification;Estimation;Crowdsourcing;Acoustics;Speech;Harmonic analysis","","1","","28","IEEE","14 Jul 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To reduce the time consuming of accomplishing crowdsourcing photo collection tasks, we focus on optimizing the task allocation method and improving the photo-taking client. This paper introduces our VCS platform for collecting outdoor crowdsourcing photos, namely LuckyPhoto. Firstly, we use different task allocation methods to handle different types of tasks.

Secondly, we develop Apps for both data requesters and workers. Both Apps utilize sensors in smartphones, which brings convenience to data requests to create tasks and to workers to accomplish tasks respectively. As a result, LuckyPhoto App provides workers with hints to collect photos efficiently. 78 college students were paid to use LuckyPhoto to accomplish tasks and 749 photos were collected.

We model the worker latent relation and task latent relation by exploiting the worker participating behavior. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to consider the worker participating behavior. Our model is a semi-supervised model that can cover tasks with feedback and tasks without feedback. We employ the ladder network to generate the representations of workers and employ the neural network to predict the worker ability scores.

We propose a crowdsourcing-based approach to evaluate and compare ranking functions for spatial keyword search. Given two ranking functions f1 and f2, we use a matrix to model all possible binary questions regarding the different results produced by f1 and f2. We propose a multi-step process to reduce the number of binary questions, identifying the most important questions to ask. Further, we design a crowdsourcing model that obtains the answers to those important binary questions from crowd workers.

Unfortunately, creating human intelligence tasks (HITs) to enable crowdsourcing is cumbersome for network data and may even be prohibitive for privacy reasons. To overcome this limitation, we present a novel framework called surrogate learning to transform the network data into a new representation (i.e., images) so that the labeling task can be completed even by non-domain experts. We analyze the reconstruction error of the transformation and use the theoretical insights to provide guidance on how to develop an effective surrogate learning approach for any given network and source image corpus.

Due to the easiness of crowdsourcing small tasks with low cost, a straightforward solution for label quality improvement is to collect multiple labels from a crowd, and then aggregate the answers. The aggregation strategies include majority voting and its many variants, EM-based approaches, Graph Neural Nets and so on. However, due to the uncertainty information loss and commonly existing task correlations, the aggregated labels usually contain errors and may damnify the downstream model training.To address the above problem, we propose a hierarchical crowdsourcing framework1 for data labeling with noisy answers about correlated data. We make use of the heterogeneity of the labeling crowd and form an initialization-checking-update loop to improve the quality of labeled data. We formalize and successfully solve the core optimization problem, namely, selecting a proper set of checking tasks for each round. We prove that maximizing the expected quality improvement is equivalent to minimizing the conditional entropy of the observations given the crowdsourced answer families for the selected task set, which is NP-hard to solve. Therefore, we design an efficient approximation algorithm and conduct a series of experiments on real data. The experimental results show that the proposed method effectively improves the quality of the labeled data sets as well as the SOTA performance, yet without extra human labor costs.","2375-026X","979-8-3503-2227-9","10.1109/ICDE55515.2023.00099","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10184732","hierarchical crowdsourcing;heterogeneous crowd;label aggregation;truth inference","Crowdsourcing;Training;Costs;Uncertainty;Approximation algorithms;Data models;Labeling","","1","","39","IEEE","26 Jul 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In many spatial crowdsourcing platforms, such as Didi, AMAP, and Uber, there are hybrid tasks, including real-time and reservation-type tasks, which are with different constraints and unevenly distributed in spatial and temporal. For these hybrid tasks, most existing studies suffer from low task completion rate and low profit for two reasons: firstly, they focus on homogeneous tasks with uniform constraints, and assign hybrid tasks separately; secondly, they cannot effectively address the uneven distribution of hybrid tasks. Inspired by this, we delve into the problem of online hybrid task assignment (HyTAO) with the goal of maximizing total revenue by simultaneously assigning both real-time and reservation-type tasks online for the first time. We prove the NP-hardness of the offline version of the HyTAO problem. To solve HyTAO effectively, we utilize a cross-platform cooperation model to tackle the challenge of non-uniform distribution. Following this, we design a binary tree-based search algorithm, namely BTS, which is capable of uniformly processing various types of tasks and quickly searching for available workers. Additionally, we discuss the parallel optimization strategies of BTS. To further enhance performance, we develop TBTS, which identifies tasks with high increased revenue based on a threshold. Finally, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of the complexity and competitive ratio of both BTS and TBTS.

For a crowdsourcing system, the task allocation has been proven to have a crucial influence on the overall performance of the system. However, there are few previous works addressing the allocation of complex tasks, resulting in inadequate capacity for such tasks in crowd-sourcing systems. This paper aims to solve the allocation problem of complex tasks by dividing complex tasks into several subtasks with dependency relationships among them and employing a two-stage genetic algorithm to optimize the allocation of each subtask. Specifically, the optimization process contains two iterative stages : the subtask sequence optimization stage and the user-subtask matching optimization stage. The former stage uses the genetic algorithm to explore different subtask sequences, while the latter stage employs a sequential decision-making approach to assign appropriate users to each subtask based on the subtask sequence. To further improve the efficiency of user-subtask matching and obtain a better allocation scheme, we combine the tabu search algorithm and simulated annealing algorithm to form two variant algorithms: GA2S-TS and GA2S-SA. The experimental results verify the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms.","","979-8-3503-4925-2","10.1109/DTPI61353.2024.10778719","National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10778719","Spatial Crowdsourcing;Complex Task Allocation;Genetic Algorithm","Crowdsourcing;Performance evaluation;Wireless networks;Simulation;Simulated annealing;Digital twins;Resource management;Smart devices;Optimization;Genetic algorithms","","","","17","IEEE","12 Dec 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To realize this, the metaverse will inevitably employ numerous machine learning (ML) systems to enable the virtual-physical mapping process and offer intelligent virtual services to metaverse users (MUs). However, metaverse service providers (MSPs), who need ML models for their services (e.g., virtual events and healthcare services), may not have the expertise or resources required to build these underlying ML models. In addition, although ML models can be offered by a crowd of experienced ML workers (MLWs), the MLWs might not be able to collect the desired data for training their ML models due to privacy issues and the large-scale, distributed nature of the metaverse. In this paper, we propose MetaCrowd, a blockchain-based ML crowdsourcing framework that aims to overcome the mentioned issues and make ML accessible to a wide range of MUs and MSPs.

The paper also contributes towards illustrating research trends highlighting the possible limitations.","","979-8-3503-3401-2","10.1109/I2CT57861.2023.10126479","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10126479","Crowdsourcing;Social Network;Text Mining;Natural Language;Machine Learning","Crowdsourcing;Text mining;Deep learning;Social networking (online);Computational modeling;Buildings;Market research","","","","46","IEEE","23 May 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, previous work on the limit of crowdsourcing in IR evaluation is still inadequate and need further investigation especially for varying nature of queries used during the Web search. In this study, we have observed the responses from the crowdsourced workers and experts in assessing the judgments, compared the agreement between the relevance judgments made by an expert assessor and crowdsourced worker, and finally explored the constancy in system ranking when these two sets of relevance judgments were used to score the systems. Two commercial search engines were compared using two different types of queries namely the faceted and ambiguous queries. In general, both set of judgments ranked the systems in the same order although the absolute systems scores vary slightly. However, the findings shows that the type of query used does influence the agreement between assessors and the system performance measure.","","978-0-9893193-1-7","10.1109/SAI.2014.6918273","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6918273","information retrieval;evaluation;crowdsourcing;relevant assessment","Crowdsourcing;Search engines;Google;Computer science;Web search;Information systems","","","","26","","9 Oct 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The identities of workers associated with individual responses are not explicitly revealed. By exploiting the sparse nature of the encoding vectors, we first propose an approximate maximum a posteriori probability (Approx. MAP) detector to perform the detection. Then, to further reduce computational complexity, we devise a generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT) where probable malicious workers are first identified before a simple hypothesis test is performed. The identification of malicious workers is performed by a low-complexity probability-based rule that exploits a certain sparse structure inherent in the crowd data as well as the associated statistical assumptions.

Speech quality studies have traditionally been conducted in restricted laboratory rooms with professional audio equipment. Nowadays, crowd-sourcing represents a valid alternative for the rapid assessment of large speech databases at a fraction of the cost and time of traditional laboratory practices. However, crowd-sourcing users perform tasks in an unsupervised manner. Thus, it is challenging to control whether their skills match those of the study's intended audience. This is important in speech quality evaluations as some listeners may end up participating in a listening test of a target language other than their mother tongue. This paper investigates the influence of assessing the quality of a German speech dataset with native English and Spanish speakers. To this end, three studies were conducted in crowdsourcing where listeners evaluated the quality of speech stimuli following the ITU-T Rec. P.808. A strong Pearson correlation and low RMSE was found between the laboratory ratings and the scores collected in all crowdsourcing studies, despite the listeners' mother tongue. Still, a bias was seen between the mean opinion scores from the German crowd-workers and the native English and Spanish speakers. The non-German participants tended to overestimate the quality of the speech stimuli.","2472-7814","978-1-6654-3589-5","10.1109/QoMEX51781.2021.9465437","Ministry of Education; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9465437","speech quality;crowdsourcing;language differences","Crowdsourcing;Tongue;Correlation;Databases;Interactive systems;User experience;Quality assessment","","","","13","IEEE","30 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To address the problems, this research proposes a Federated Learning (FL) and Incremental Learning (IL) based framework in SC that integrates advanced privacy-preserving techniques. By leveraging FL and adaptive differential privacy, sensitive data remains in decentralised devices while local models are trained without exchanging raw data to a server. We integrate additive secret sharing, a secure multi-party computation technique to protect data during transmission and aggregation. IL enhances the framework using a generative replay approach to ensure continuous adaptation to new data without forgetting existing knowledge to overcome catastrophic forgetting. We broadly evaluate our work against MIA and catastrophic forgetting using Yelp datasets. Compared with other baseline approaches, our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly mitigates the risk of MIAs by around 50% and improves forgetting accuracy by up to 13%, thereby providing robust privacy-preserving mechanisms.","2577-2465","979-8-3315-1778-6","10.1109/VTC2024-Fall63153.2024.10757796","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10757796","Spatial Crowdsourcing;federated and incremental learning;adaptive differential privacy;membership inference attacks;catastrophic forgetting","Crowdsourcing;Vehicular and wireless technologies;Differential privacy;Incremental learning;Smart cities;Multi-party computation;Data models;Spatiotemporal phenomena;Servers;Computer security","","","","29","IEEE","28 Nov 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, despite of providing tremendous social benefits, the release of crowdsourced data will pose a considerable threat to mobile users' privacy. Differential privacy has been adopted for privacy preservation of crowdsourced data, yet the effective mining of protected data becomes challenging. In this paper, we investigate the problem of spatial cluster detection on privacy-preserving crowdsourced data. Specifically, we propose PSCluster, a differentially private spatial cluster detection mechanism to provide services with data protected under a differential privacy model. PSCluster's key components include a hypothesis testing framework for modeling differentially private spatial data, and a hybrid algorithm that jointly conducts expectation maximization (EM)-based parameter estimation and free-form spatial cluster detection. We evaluate PSCluster over synthetic data and real data from mobile crowdsourcing applications, and compare PSCluster with two state-of-the-art baseline methods.

For maximum profits, platforms carefully choose the workers and determine the video analytics configurations to ensure accuracy; meanwhile, workers possess the flexibility to tailor the configurations for their indivi-dual gains, which makes it hard for platforms to optimize their profits considering the platform-worker conflicts. In this paper, we design an incentive mechanism for Multi-leader game-based video Analytics upon CROwdsourcing, named MACRO, to over-come the above situation. Under that mechanism, we first formu-late the utility optimization problems for platforms and workers, respectively. We then propose a dual ascent-based method to op-timally determine the video analytics configurations for a multi-platform game, ensuring Pareto efficiency. Moreover, in the context of a multi-leader game involving platform-worker conflicts, we design an incentive function with its incentive factor update strategy and propose an ADMM-based approach for maximizing incentives that motivate workers to contribute to the platforms' profits. Rigorous proofs demonstrate the linear convergence of the MACRO to the multi-leader Stackelberg equilibrium. Trace-driven experiments show that MACRO improves the Pareto efficiency by 26.3%, outperforming other approaches.","2375-026X","979-8-3503-1715-2","10.1109/ICDE60146.2024.00029","NSFC(grant numbers:62202233); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10598110","","Crowdsourcing;Accuracy;Visual analytics;Games;Data engineering;Outsourcing;Task analysis","","","","76","IEEE","23 Jul 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we present a novel secure and decentralized crowdsourcing task-matching resolution built atop consortium blockchain, in which the flexible matching and privacy demands of both task requesters and workers are taken into account. Particularly, we design a decentralized ciphertext-policy attribute-based keyword search scheme with hidden policy, simultaneously supporting fine-grained worker selection and worker-side keyword search of interested tasks with bilateral privacy. The matching procedure is conducted on a consortium blockchain with guaranteed matching integrity. Our scheme achieves the desired security goals in the random oracle model.

However, sometimes the quality of the task is not satisfied because workers lack of expertise knowledge or workers do not put all of their effort. In order to better use crowdsourcing system, it is necessary to design incentive mechanism to ensure workers try their best to propose answers in the process of completing tasks. Therefore, in this paper, we study how to design incentive mechanisms with inserting gold standard questions in the crowdsourced tasks, and applying approval voting to utilize workers' partial knowledge as much as possible. In particular, workers would pay cost for every option they selected, and get proper reward only if they select the true answer for gold standard questions. In the paper, it theoretically proves that the proposed mechanism has good properties compared with other mechanisms and meets the constraint of incentivizing workers to select all options with belief higher than the threshold and thus improves the total quality of workers' answers. Finally, experiment results show that the mechanism can improve the quality of workers' answers in completing tasks.","","978-1-6654-5606-7","10.1109/ICMSS56787.2023.10117884","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10117884","crowdsourcing;incentive mechanism;approval voting","Crowdsourcing;Costs;Machine learning;Tagging;Labeling;Task analysis;Software engineering","","","","19","IEEE","10 May 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The system stands alone in the sense that it does not need any hardware support; it also works on any program, no matter how that program was conceived or compiled.

Researchers have suggested several approaches, e.g., leveraging software metrics, to predict vulnerability in the source code. The majority of these approaches require the whole code base or a big chunk of it to perform the prediction. The answers on those Q&A websites, however, are code snippets typically with a single function, or, at most a couple of related functions. Predicting vulnerabilities in such code snippets has received limited attention. Few examples present in the literature suggest leveraging function-level software metrics to predict vulnerable code. Such work, however, provides incomplete analysis with heavily imbalanced datasets. This paper examines whether function-level code metrics can differentiate the vulnerable and fixed versions of a given function. In particular, we develop a “near-balanced” dataset with a total of 132,754 function instances, calculate 18 function-level code metrics for both vulnerable $(49.6 \%$ of the total) and fixed versions of the functions, and conduct binary logistic regression with the Wald test. The results suggest that function-level code metrics may not be useful in predicting if a given function contains vulnerability.","2835-5776","979-8-3503-5118-7","10.1109/IRI62200.2024.00059","National Science Foundation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10703831","software metrics;function-level software metrics;software vulnerabilities;logistic regression","Logistic regression;Codes;Source coding;Data science;Software systems;Rough surfaces;Software measurement;Security","","","","27","IEEE","8 Oct 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"Music information seeking via social Q&A: An analysis of questions in Music StackExchange community","H. Fu; Y. Fan","School of Information, Florida State University, Tallahassee, FL; Répertoire International de Littérature Musicale (RILM), City University of New York, NY",2016 IEEE/ACM Joint Conference on Digital Libraries (JCDL),"5 Sep 2016","2016","","","139","142","In this paper we report preliminary findings based on a quantitative analysis of data from a music social Q&A site, Music StackExchange, focusing on real-life music information needs, uses, and seeking. Eight major topic categories and a two-level taxonomy for question type/intent and the characteristics of questions in each category are presented. Our findings suggest that Q&A sites are a fruitful resource for identifying users' music information needs, how these needs are expressed, and intended uses for the information. On Music StackExchange, users' questioning behaviors were motivated by the recognition of knowledge gaps, lack of resources, need for others' opinions, or interest in research issues, spanning different topics. This study is explorative in nature and the results could improve the understanding of everyday life music information seeking. The findings can inform music librarians and general-purpose music information systems designers of the needs, requirements, and approaches to enhance music related controlled vocabularies, and improve search engines and online knowledge sharing communities to categorize and provide users with more relevant music information.","","978-1-4503-4229-2","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7559576","Music information needs and uses;Music information seeking;Music information behavior;Question type;Social Q&A site","Instruments;Music;Software;Training;Taxonomy;Google;Metadata","","","","15","","5 Sep 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Different Islamic Q&A websites usually shares similar Q&A topics that have been frequently asked by Islamic learners. However, due to a large number of Q&A entries in such websites, manual topic classification would be costly and time consuming. The objectives of this research are to develop a classification system for Islamic Q&A topics and analyze the vocabulary words that affect the classification results. To achieve these objectives, well-known supervised learning methods that have been previously implemented to classify Islamic texts are utilized, namely K-Nearest Neighbor (K-NN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Multinomial Naive Bayes (MNB), and Multinomial Logistic Regression (MLR). In this research, these classifiers are evaluated in classifying Islamic Q&A entries. The evaluation finds that the SVM achieves the best accuracy and Hamming loss at 79.8 percent and 0.202, respectively. This research also finds that the relevant or specific vocabulary from a class can improve the classification system’s ability to predict correctly and vice versa.","","978-1-6654-3709-7","10.1109/ICADEIS52521.2021.9701944","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9701944","Topic Classification;Islamic Question and Answer;Supervised Learning;Vocabulary Words","Support vector machines;Vocabulary;Electronic learning;Automation;Supervised learning;Manuals;Data science","","1","","20","IEEE","9 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
