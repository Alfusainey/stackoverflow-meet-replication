"MetaClusterFL: Personalized Federated Learning on Non-IID data with Meta-learning and Clustering","H. Zeng; S. Xiong; H.

But Lots of studies have demonstrated that Non-IID data significantly impacts the accuracy of global models. To address this challenge, we propose a new personalized federated learning framework, MetaClusterFL, which combines federated meta-learning and clustering federated learning. MetaClusterFL leverages the trained meta-model to facilitate knowledge sharing during the clustering process and compute the similarity between client data distributions. It dynamically detects the optimal number of clusters for accurate client clustering without requiring additional hyperparameters. The clustered clients then train clusterlevel meta-models, which serve as the initial models for their personalized models. We conduct experiments on three benchmark FL datasets with different classification tasks to validate the performance of our approach on Non-IID data. Experimental results show that MetaClusterFL outperforms other comparative methods in the same field.","2161-4407","979-8-3503-5931-2","10.1109/IJCNN60899.2024.10651181","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10651181","Personalized federated learning;Meta-learning;clustering method","Metalearning;Data privacy;Accuracy;Federated learning;Computational modeling;Neural networks;Benchmark testing","","","","39","IEEE","9 Sep 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This pattern is: “using binary relation types directly derived from concept types, especially role types or process types”. The article explains this pattern and relates it to other ones, thereby illustrating ways to organize such patterns. It also provides a top-level ontology for generating relation types from concept types, e.g., those from lexical ontologies such as those derived from the WordNet lexical database.

However, socially aware robots face many challenges preventing their widespread public adoption. Two such major challenges are (1) lack in behavior adaptation to new environments, contexts and users, and (2) insufficient capability for privacy protection. The commonly employed centralized learning paradigm, whereby training data is gathered and centralized in a single location (i.e., machine/ server) and the centralized entity trains and hosts the model, contributes to these limitations by preventing online learning of new experiences and requiring storage of privacy-sensitive data. In this work, we propose a decentralized learning paradigm that aims to improve the personalization capability of social robots while also paving the way towards privacy preservation. First, we present a new framework by capitalising on two machine learning approaches, Federated Learning and Continual Learning, to capture interaction dynamics distributed physically across robots and temporally across repeated robot encounters. Second, we introduce four criteria (adaptation quality, adaptation time, knowledge sharing, and model overhead) that should be balanced within our decentralized robot learning framework. Third, we develop a new algorithm – Elastic Transfer – that leverages importance-based regularization to preserve relevant parameters across robots and interactions with multiple humans (users). We show that decentralized learning is a viable alternative to centralized learning in a proof-of-concept Socially-Aware Navigation domain, and demonstrate the efficacy of Elastic Transfer across our proposed evaluation criteria.","1944-9437","979-8-3503-3670-2","10.1109/RO-MAN57019.2023.10309661","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10309661","","Privacy;Adaptation models;Navigation;Federated learning;Heuristic algorithms;Social robots;Training data","","","","40","IEEE","13 Nov 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

By creating a culture of knowledge-sharing and collaboration, organizations can increase employee engagement and job satisfaction. This, in turn, leads to higher employee retention rates as employees are more likely to stay in an organization that values their knowledge and expertise. Unfortunately, experts are often unwilling to share their knowledge, either explicitly or tacitly, for various reasons. Because of this, it is difficult to acquire tacit knowledge or convert it into explicit knowledge. According to existing literature, a large amount of research has been done about externalization for converting tacit knowledge to explicit knowledge; however, their methodology is too basic and does not take into account the angular parameter of the tacit knowledge vector similarity algorithm, which reduces the effectiveness of the conversion. This research introduces a set of matching algorithms for explicit cases of tacit knowledge, with regards to the similarity condition of explicit cases of tacit knowledge. To optimize strong objectivity, rough set and entropy weight method is used to calculate the interval aspect weight with focus on complementary advantages. Next, optimal dispersion is used to improve the weight fusion optimization's time interval. Lastly, the Degree of Calculation Method determines the similarity of the case view. Based on the result of the similarity calculation, the historical case which is the same or has the highest similarity to the problem being solved is identified. The results of the case study show that the algorithm designed in this paper is effective and practical. This research can be beneficial in a knowledge management system, as it can recover and combine the implicit knowledge into interval-oriented knowledge, with the help of interval-based explicit case matching vector algorithms.","","979-8-3503-1132-7","10.1109/RESEM57584.2023.10236412","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10236412","Tacit Knowledge;Case Study;Interval Aspects;Vector Similarity Algorithm;Explicit Knowledge Case","Renewable energy sources;Rough sets;Collaboration;Organizations;Knowledge management;Entropy;Cognition","","","","26","IEEE","4 Sep 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Additionally, it promotes cross-cultural communication, inclusivity, and collaborative knowledge sharing. By training models on biscript lexicons, we can achieve more accurate translation, language generation, and language understanding across different scripts. This paper aims to evaluate the performance of a Sequence-to-Sequence (Seq2Seq) model based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architecture. The evaluation focuses on a biscript lexicon within the context of the Moroccan language. While Seq2Seq models have shown promise in various natural language processing tasks, their application to biscript lexicons remains relatively unexplored.

These characteristics have led to the increasing scale and complexity of software systems, and the increasing variety of research & development (R&D) personnel. This further intensify the knowledge-intensive trend of software development, and make the software requirements elicitation activities more complicated. In the knowledge engineering community, an ontology is an explicit specification of a conceptualization. This paper uses the ontology method to construct a requirement knowledge framework and requirement knowledge is expressed as a clear, complete, and consistent hierarchical ontology concept and association, which is more conducive to knowledge sharing and reuse as well as reflects multiple viewpoints of stakeholders. This paper builds a requirements knowledge multi-ontology framework which is divided into GO (generalization ontology), TO (task ontology), DO (domain ontology), and AO (application ontology). And it decomposes the GO into structure ontology and action ontology in the framework. It makes up for the deficiency of undifferentiated knowledge representation of the GO. Then, this paper proposes and integrates the concept of software requirement error pattern into the multi-ontology framework in a consistent form. In addition, this paper evaluates the quality of the constructed ontology and the evaluation results show that the constructed ontology in this paper has a high quality.

It allows collaborative training of a single ML model across edge devices while keeping data locally, preserving privacy. However, scalability remains a challenge, especially for large ML models, and can yield suboptimal results when local data distributions diverge. We present a robust and efficient Fed-aided multi-task temporal clustering (FeMTC) knowledge-sharing framework tailored to the demands of highly distributed vehicular networks. Our approach quantifies the temporal similarity between a pair of client vectors to group clients with higher similarity at the edge-base server and trains independently on single and multi-task cluster learning.

Fed2PKD combines prototypical contrastive knowledge distillation to align client embeddings with global class prototypes and semi-supervised global knowledge distillation to capture global data characteristics. Experimental results on three benchmarks (MNIST, CIFAR10, and CIFAR100) demonstrate that Fed2PKD significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art HFL methods, achieving average improvements of up to 30.53%, 13.89%, and 5.80 % in global model accuracy, respectively. Furthermore, Fed2PKD enables personalized models for each client, adapting to their specific data distributions and model architectures while benefiting from global knowledge sharing. Theoretical analysis provides convergence guarantees for Fed2PKD under realistic assumptions.

A problem is split into small chunks, that are then solved by a crowd of users on the Internet. In this paper we investigate whether it is possible to exploit CrowdSourcing to solve the oracle problem: We produce tasks asking users to evaluate CrowdOracles - assertions that reflect the current behavior of the program. If the crowd determines that an assertion does not match the behavior described in the code documentation, then a bug has been found.

However, due to highly dynamic vehicular topology, these existing centralized-based or distributed-based scheduling algorithms requiring high communication overhead, are not suitable for task offloading in vehicular networks. Therefore, we investigate a novel service scenario of MEC-based vehicular crowdsourcing, where each MEC server is an independent agent and responsible for making scheduling of processing traffic data sensed by crowdsourcing vehicles. On this basis, we formulate a data-driven task offloading problem by jointly optimizing offloading decision and bandwidth/computation resource allocation, and renting cost of heterogeneous servers, such as powerful vehicles, MEC servers and cloud, which is a mixed-integer programming problem and NP-hard. To reduce high time-complexity, we propose the solution in two stages. First, we design an asynchronous deep Q-learning to determine offloading decision, which achieves fast convergence by training the local DQN model at each agent in parallel and uploading for global model update asynchronously. Second, we decompose the remaining resource allocation problem into several independent subproblems and derive optimal analytic formula based on convex theory. Lastly, we build a simulation model and conduct comprehensive simulation, which demonstrates the superiority of the proposed algorithm.","2641-9874","978-1-6654-0325-2","10.1109/INFOCOM42981.2021.9488886","National Natural Science Foundation of China; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9488886","Mobile edge computing;vehicular networks;task offloading;asynchronous deep reinforcement learning","Crowdsourcing;Training;Wireless communication;Computational modeling;Reinforcement learning;Servers;Resource management","","53","","29","IEEE","26 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

On the flip side, crowdsourcing-based map generation method does need individual locations. To address the issue, we present a systematic participatory-sensing-based high-quality map generation scheme, PMG, that meets the privacy demand of individual users. In this approach, individual users merely need to upload unorganized sparse location points so as to reduce the risk of exposing privacy, while the server generates accurate maps with unorganized points, instead of user traces. Experiments show that our solution is able to generate high-quality maps for a real environment that is robust to noisy data.

However, those studies focused only on adaptation between two layers so far. This work extends these findings by taking adaptation between three layers into account. Thereby, especially the impact of an intermediate layer on user perceived quality is investigated. Crowdsourcing experiments were conducted in order to collect subjective ratings for adaptation between three layers. The results indicate that the quality of each layer and the time on each layer are important QoE parameters.

To handle the uncertainty, probabilistic databases can be used to store uncertain data, and querying facilities are provided to yield answers with confidence. However, the uncertainty may propagate, hence the returned results from a query or mining process may not be useful. In this paper, we leverage the power of crowdsourcing for cleaning uncertain data. Specifically, we will design a set of Human Intelligence Tasks (HIT)s to ask a crowd to improve the quality of uncertain data. Each HIT is associated with a cost, thus, we need to design solutions to maximize the data quality with minimal number of HITs. There are two obstacles for this non-trivial optimization - first, the crowd has a probability to return incorrect answers; second, the HITs decomposed from uncertain data are often correlated. These two obstacles lead to very high computational cost for selecting the optimal set of HITs. Thus, in this paper, we have addressed these challenges by designing an effective approximation algorithm and an efficient heuristic solution. To further improve the efficiency, we derive tight lower and upper bounds, which are used for effective filtering and estimation. We have verified the solutions with extensive experiments on both a simulated crowd and a real crowdsourcing platform.","2375-026X","978-1-4799-7964-6","10.1109/ICDE.2015.7113268","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7113268","","Crowdsourcing;Cleaning;Accuracy;Entropy;Semantics;Uncertainty;Cities and towns","","23","","38","IEEE","1 Jun 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, signal strength variations across diverse devices becomes a major problem in this system, especially in the crowdsourcing based localization system. In this paper, the linear regression algorithm is proposed to solve this problem automatically. First of all, the problem of device diversity and the adverse effects caused by this problem are analyzed. Then the intrinsic relationship between different RSS values collected by different devices is mined by the linear regression algorithm. The problem of device diversity will be handled by this algorithm. In crowdsourcing systems, when the major problem is eliminated, a unique radio-map can be created in the offline phase and the user's location can be estimated by a localization algorithm in the online phase. Experimental results show that the proposed method results in a higher reliability and localization accuracy.","","978-1-5090-5019-2","10.1109/GLOCOM.2017.8254137","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8254137","","Wireless LAN;Linear regression;Mobile handsets;Training;Crowdsourcing;Correlation;Estimation","","18","","15","IEEE","15 Jan 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

REM is a tool for analyzing radio propagation, which is typically defined as a map that stores the received signal power. Crowdsourcing with spatial interpolation (e.g., Kriging) can accurately construct the REM, and the accurate REM improves the efficiency of spectrum use. However, crowdsourcing can only be performed over frequencies in which the mobile terminals can perform the sensing. Thus, conventional REM construction may only improve the spectral efficiency in the frequency in which the sensing can be performed. Our proposed method focuses on the fact that the average received signal power, which consists of path loss and shadowing, shows a strong correlation over the frequency domain. We show that utilizing correlations over both frequency and spatial domains can construct the REM even if the datasets are not available at the estimated environment.","","978-1-7281-4985-1","10.1109/ICAIIC48513.2020.9065217","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9065217","","Correlation;Shadow mapping;Interpolation;Frequency measurement;Radio propagation;Mathematical model;Wireless communication","","18","","12","IEEE","16 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Crowdsourcing-based spectrum sensing has great potential in improving the accuracy of the REM at the DBA but requires strong incentives and privacy protection to simulate mobile users' participation.

Our solution leverages Secondary Surveillance Radar Mode S and ADS-B transponder signals that are continuously transmitted by aircraft for air traffic control purposes. It builds on signals captured by the OpenSky Network, a global-scale sensor network crowdsourcing 15+ billions of transponder messages per day from aircraft up to an altitude of 13 km. Based on the decoded data, we infer meteorological conditions such as air temperature, wind speed, wind direction and atmospheric pressure. Our evaluation demonstrates that our approach is effective at estimating these parameters with high resolutions along the tracks of more than 50 percent of all aircraft monitored by the OpenSky Network. Our method delivers estimations for temperature with 0.11°C, wind speed with 0.09 m/s, wind direction with 1.00°, and air pressure with 0.10 hPa average deviation, making those measurements suitable for the assimilation in numerical weather models.","","978-1-5386-5298-5","10.1109/IPSN.2018.00010","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8480033","crowdsourcing;atmosphere;meteorology;air traffic control;sensor network;temperature;wind;pressure","Aircraft;Air traffic control;Atmospheric modeling;Radar;Wind;Estimation","","16","","24","IEEE","4 Oct 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this context, large scale analytics is needed to extract knowledge and value from the data produced by these sensors. The ability to perform analytics on these data, however, is highly limited by the difficulties of collecting labels. Indeed, the machine learning techniques used to perform analytics rely upon data labels to learn and to validate results. Historically, crowdsourcing platforms have been used to gather labels, yet they cannot be directly used in the IoT because of poor human readability of sensor data. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes a framework for sensor data analytics which leverages the power of crowdsourcing through gamification to acquire sensor data labels. The framework uses gamification as a socially engaging vehicle and as a way to motivate users to participate in various labelling tasks. To demonstrate the framework proposed, a case study is also presented. Evaluation results show the framework can successfully translate gamification events into sensor data labels.","","978-1-5386-2011-3","10.1109/IEEE.ICIOT.2017.18","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8039057","Internet of Things;Sensor Data;Gamification;Data Analytics;Machine Learning;Crowdsourcing","Labeling;Games;Crowdsourcing;Data analysis;Event detection;Data mining;Machine learning algorithms","","16","","26","IEEE","18 Sep 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This city with a population of approximately 6.7 million people came to a standstill. Astonishingly, one of the biggest software development hubs in India was struggling for data and tools to identify which parts of the city were most affected and vulnerable to such climate phenomena. A group of software engineers quickly came up with an idea of using a Flood Map tool managed through crowdsourcing to help the citizens of Chennai and prevent further casualties. They developed a map-based tool called Flooded Streets to report flooded streets using OpenStreetMap (OSM) data. Using this Flood Map tool, anyone in the crowd could click on a street if they knew it was flooded and update the map information. Within the following 24 hours, over 2,500 streets had been reported as flooded by the citizens of Chennai using the Flood Map tool. An ordinary citizen could zoom into a locality, visualize which streets are reported as flooded and decide their next course of action. This map was also a great aid tool for relief and aid workers to track the flooded paths and provide appropriate aids in that area. The map consists of a base layer of low-lying areas created using elevation models from ISRO and NASA, and flooded areas from UNITAR. The map interactivity was built using Mapbox GL and hosted on GitHub. This crowdsourced sensing system is an extraordinary example of disaster response using the crowdsourcing concept, which potentially helped millions of people with the minimum time and resources but with great crowd contributions from both experts and non-experts.","","978-1-5090-0793-6","10.1109/SysEng.2016.7753186","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7753186","Crowdsourced Sensing System;crowdsensing system;Flooded Streets;Chennai;India;OpenStreetMap;Crowdsourcing;Disaster Response","Sensors;Crowdsourcing;Urban areas;Floods;Pollution measurement;Atmospheric measurements;Software","","15","","18","IEEE","24 Nov 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We introduce SpatialSense, a dataset specializing in spatial relation recognition which captures a broad spectrum of such challenges, allowing for proper benchmarking of computer vision techniques. SpatialSense is constructed through adversarial crowdsourcing, in which human annotators are tasked with finding spatial relations that are difficult to predict using simple cues such as 2D spatial configuration or language priors. Adversarial crowdsourcing significantly reduces dataset bias and samples more interesting relations in the long tail compared to existing datasets. On SpatialSense, state-of-the-art recognition models perform comparably to simple baselines, suggesting that they rely on straightforward cues instead of fully reasoning about this complex task.

In this paper, we tackle the problem of stimulating enough smartphone users to join in MCS activities with their smartphones. Moreover, the scenario that the selected users drop out of the sensing tasks with random probability during their sensing processes is also taken into account. Therefore, we propose a novel incentive mechanism called IMRAL - an Incentive Mechanism based on Reverse Auction for Location-aware sensing. IMRAL aims to enhance the participants' enthusiasm by maximizing their expected profits. It consists of two parts: winner selection algorithm and payment determination scheme. In the first part, we formulate a winner selection problem by considering the service coverage of mobile users. Due to the NP-hardness of the problem, we introduce a task-centric method to determine the winning bids with polynomial time complexity. The second part is a payment scheme, which determines the payment to winners by a time proportional share rule to ensure the truthful of IMRAL and consider the effects of the randomness of the selected users, and the winners can obtain the maximum utility. Through rigid theoretical analysis, we demonstrate that the proposed mechanism satisfies the properties of computational efficiency, individual rationality, budget feasibility and truthfulness. Simulation results show that, compared with TRAC (truthful auction for location-aware collaborative sensing in mobile crowdsourcing) and IMC-SS (incentive mechanism for crowdsourcing in the single-requester single-bid-model), the IMRAL can achieve better performance in terms of average user utility and tasks coverage ratio.","1938-1883","978-1-5386-3180-5","10.1109/ICC.2018.8423009","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8423009","","Task analysis;Sensors;Crowdsourcing;Collaboration;Redundancy;Telecommunications;Electronic mail","","13","","15","IEEE","30 Jul 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Our study finds the gamified-enhanced crowdsourcing environment works best for ranking candidates for technical jobs while the text mining and gamified crowdsourcing environments perform equally well for ranking candidates for non-technical jobs. Last, we discuss possible reasons for our results as well as suggest possible enhancements to reduce the gap between our strategies and the HR executive recruiting experts.","2375-9259","978-1-5386-3800-2","10.1109/ICDMW.2017.31","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8215662","text mining;human resources;gamification;information retrieval;job search","Conferences;Data mining","","11","","15","IEEE","18 Dec 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Crowdsourced Software Testing (CST) is a specific, valuable crowdsourcing service. Its scale, flexibility, cost effectiveness and fast turnaround times are just a few reasons why web-based crowdsourced testing services have recently received a great deal of attention. Major software companies have used CST to test their applications. However, CST has its own challenges and limitations (e.g., tester selection dilemmas, test report processing, overall test quality). The lack of coordination support in CST activities is causing delays and missed opportunities; hence, the best test results may not be guaranteed. This paper presents ongoing research that aims to support coordination in CST activities by identifying coordination challenges in the current practices. The quantitative comparison of 15 CST platforms reveals a lack of computer-based support for testers, project managers and clients.","","978-1-5386-5207-7","10.1109/SOSE.2018.00018","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8359151","Crowdsourcing;Software Testing;Crowdsourced Software Testing;Coordination;Process improvements;Web Services.","Computer bugs;Software testing;Crowdsourcing;Software;Outsourcing;Task analysis","","11","","21","Crown","17 May 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Existing approaches usually focus on exploiting the periodicity properties of the traffic speed and utilize crowdsourcing techniques to facilitate real-time estimation. The quality of such estimation is limited in real world: 1) the accuracy of existing estimation over-relies on the probed data; 2) the accidental traffic variance is ignored; 3) existing strategies incur exhaustive usage of human workers to get fine-grained estimation results. Thus, a more intelligent RTSE approach is desired. In this paper, we propose the framework of CrowdRTSE (Crowdsourcing-based Real-time Traffic Speed Estimation), which adopts a hybrid offline-online process to collaboratively exploit the historical and real-time data to produce high-quality RTSE. To accomplish such a framework, we devise effective algorithms to judiciously select the best group of human workers with a constant approximation ratio, and effectively propagate the crowdsourced data with high efficiency. Comprehensive evaluations have been conducted on both synthetic and real world datasets. The experimental results verify the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed methods.","2375-026X","978-1-5386-5520-7","10.1109/ICDE.2018.00038","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8509259","crowdsourcing;traffic speed;urban computing","Roads;Estimation;Crowdsourcing;Correlation;Task analysis;Sensors;Graphical models","","10","","35","IEEE","25 Oct 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Employing publicly available building footprints to reconstruct individual blocks rather than the whole city at once enables our system to easily scale to large urban environments. In order to map all partial reconstructions into a single coordinate frame, we develop a robust alignment scheme that registers the individual point clouds to their corresponding footprints based on GPS coordinates. Our approach can handle noise and outliers in the GPS positions and allows us to detect wrong alignments caused by the typical issues in the context of crowdsourcing applications such as malicious or improper image uploads.

Although several interesting approaches have been developed for monitoring pollution and noise, however the challenge remains for even more detailed, precise, large scale monitoring.To overcome the limitations of current systems, we envision an integrated approach to human-centric environmental intelligence, bringing together modern IoT technology and the human factor. In particular, our approach emphasizes selected behavioural and health aspects, and the complementary use of sensing technology with citizen engagement and crowdsourcing methods. The proposed system will collect diverse data from heterogeneous sources, such as mobile and static wireless sensor networks, crowdsourcing, citizen questionnaires and social media analytics, to continuously combine objective estimations with subjective perception of air quality and noise. With the use of advanced AI and Deep Learning algorithms, our system will be able to estimate air pollutants concentration and noise levels in micro-scale with adequate precision over large urban-scale environments. Furthermore, tracking of behavioral and psychological users' input, as well as personal exposure to pollution, will allow studying the impact of air quality and noise on the users' daily habits and the interplay of ambient conditions with behavioural factors, towards an active engagement of citizens in a hybrid techno-social manner. A reference architecture for the realization of this human-centric environmental intelligence approach is presented. Also, a planned implementation at the city of Patras, Greece is discussed.

In this paper, we present first results from a large-scale crowdsourcing study in which three major video streaming OTTs were compared across five major national ISPs in Germany. We not only look at streaming performance in terms of loading times and stalling, but also customer behavior (e.g., user engagement) and Quality of Experience based on the ITU-T P.1203 QoE model. We used a browser extension to evaluate the streaming quality and to passively collect anonymous OTT usage information based on explicit user consent. Our data comprises over 400,000 video playbacks from more than 2,000 users, collected throughout the entire year of 2019. The results show differences in how customers use the video services, how the content is watched, how the network influences video streaming QoE, and how user engagement varies by service. Hence, the crowdsourcing paradigm is a viable approach for third parties to obtain streaming QoE insights from OTTs.","2472-7814","978-1-7281-5965-2","10.1109/QoMEX48832.2020.9123148","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9123148","video quality;video streaming;Quality of Experience;video streaming;adaptive streaming;user behavior;user engagement;YouTube;Netflix;Amazon Prime Video;crowdsourcing","Over-the-top media services;Crowdsourcing;Web and internet services;Loading;Quality assessment;Quality of experience;Probes","","9","","11","IEEE","23 Jun 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This method is based on selecting one reliable label from multiple labels collected by workers because a single label from only one worker has a wide variance of accuracy. Hierarchical classification, where each class has a hierarchical relationship, is a typical task in crowdsourcing. However, direct applications of existing methods designed for multi-class classification have the disadvantage of discriminating among a large number of classes. In this paper, we propose a label aggregation method for hierarchical classification tasks. Our method takes the hierarchical structure into account to handle a large number of classes and estimate worker abilities more precisely. Our method is inspired by the steps model based on item response theory, which models responses of examinees to sequentially dependent questions. We considered hierarchical classification to be a question consisting of a sequence of subquestions and built a worker response model for hierarchical classification.

Users may also want to pay more to get a parking spot during urgent need. Although the existing infrastructure-based approaches can solve this problem partially, they require a high initial investment and maintenance cost. As a consequence, deploying such approaches on a large scale in the real world is infeasible. A more economically feasible solution is using crowdsourcing-based approaches where a user near a free parking spot informs the interested users about the available parking spot in exchange for some forms of incentives. However, most of the crowdsourced approaches suffer due to the lack of proper models for price negotiation, information verification, and assurance. In this paper, we propose ParkBid, a crowdsourcing-based parking service for automobiles where the information of free parking is circulated among the interested users following a bidding process. ParkBid determines the incentives for providing any parking information based on several primitives, such as time, location, reputation, urgency, etc. Along with a detailed discussion about the challenges in ParkBid for both the users and information providers, we provide a set of policies as countermeasures. Also, we present an extensive simulation to evaluate the impact of ParkBid for users under different circumstances.

Taking the blockchain based crowdsourcing system as an example, we propose a new smart contract based cyber-insurance framework, which can greatly shorten the delay, and enable the workers to obtain the economic compensation for increased security risk caused by a conflict between the need to provide service quickly and delay in payment. We model the process of determining insurance premium and number of confirmations as a Stackelberg Game and prove the existence of Stackelberg Equilibria, at which the utility of the requester is maximized, and none of the workers can improve its utility by unilaterally deviating from its current strategy. The experimental results show that our framework can definitely improve the time efficiency of crowdsourcing.

Based on macro Device-Cluster (DC) rather than natural device, DC algorithm maintains less device types and slight calibration overhead. Despite high positioning accuracy, the selection of suitable clustering algorithms in DC system becomes another puzzle.

CBRE is done by involving crowd members through crowdsourcing. This method in turn involves many social and technical barriers, as the participants (crowd) utilized during this process belong to varying geographic regions with varying cultures and diversity, and due to the in-volvement of crowdsourcing platform during elicitation process. The objective of this PhD research proposal is to identify these socio-technical barriers involved in crowd-based requirements and devising a requirements elicitation strategy to better handle the issues involved in CBRE. An exploratory case study methodology will be utilized to explore the socio-technical barriers, the root causes as well as pros and cons of these barriers. Based on the exploratory case study results, a strategy will be devised for requirements elicitation, involving crowd participants.

However, more practical issues are still not considered.For further guaranteeing privacy and deploying systems in real time, this paper proposes OPFL, a privacy-preserved online personalized federated learning framework for fingerprint-based indoor localization. In OPFL, users update model parameters and collect new labeled samples meanwhile. By adding artificial noise based on the Differential Privacy (DP) mechanism, it is harder for attackers to infer information. Besides, the deterioration of models results from DP is mitigating by applying the personalized algorithm. The experimental results show that under the noise perturbing, the performance of OPFL testing on the local test set is far better than the conventional federated averaging algorithm (FedAvg), and is even close to the centralized training.","2577-1655","978-1-6654-4207-7","10.1109/SMC52423.2021.9658722","Nature; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9658722","","Location awareness;Training;Crowdsourcing;Privacy;Differential privacy;Heuristic algorithms;Fingerprint recognition","","6","","14","IEEE","6 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To investigate this problem, we report on a VR spatial cognition experiment that was conducted both in-lab and out-of-lab. The in-lab study was administered as a traditional experiment with undergraduate students and dedicated VR equipment. The out-of-lab study was carried out remotely by recruiting HMD owners from VR-related research mailing lists, VR subreddits in Reddit, and crowdsourcing platforms. Demographic comparisons show that our out-of-lab sample was older, included more males, and had a higher sense of direction than our in-lab sample. The results of the involved spatial memory tasks indicate that the reliability of the data from out-of-lab participants was as good as or better than their in-lab counterparts. Additionally, the data for testing our research hypotheses were comparable between in- and out-of-lab studies.

In this paper, we aim to explore characteristics of the worker population on Amazon's Mechanical Turk, a popular micro task crowdsourcing environment, and measure the percentage of workers who are potentially qualified to perform software- or computer science- related tasks. Through a baseline survey and two replications, we measure workers' answer consistency as well as the consistency of sample characteristics. In the end, we deployed 1,200 total surveys that were completed by 1,064 unique workers. Our results show that 24% of the study participants have a computer science or IT background and most people are payment driven when choosing tasks. The sample characteristics can vary significantly, even on large samples with 300 participants. Additionally, we often observed inconsistency in workers' answers for those who completed two surveys; approximately 30% answered at least one question inconsistently between the two survey submissions. This implies a need for replication and quality controls in crowdsourced experiments.","","978-1-4503-4158-5","10.1145/2897659.2897662","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7809392","Crowdsourcing;Survey","Crowdsourcing;Atmospheric measurements;Particle measurements;Computer science;Sociology;Statistics;Software engineering","","4","","21","","9 Jan 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In practice, the privacy of CFL can be compromised by many attacks, such as free-rider attacks, adversarial attacks, gradient leakage attacks, and inference attacks. Conventional defensive techniques have low efficiency because they deploy heavy encryption techniques or rely on Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs). To improve the efficiency of protecting CFL from these attacks, this paper proposes FedSlice to prevent malicious participants from getting the whole server-side model while keeping the performance goal of CFL. FedSlice breaks the server-side model into several slices and delivers one slice to each participant. Thus, a malicious participant can only get a subset of the server-side model, preventing them from effectively conducting effective attacks. We evaluate FedSlice against these attacks, and results show that FedSlice provides effective defense: the server-side model leakage is reduced from 100% to 43.45%, the success rate of adversarial attacks is reduced from 100% to 11.66%, the average accuracy of membership inference is reduced from 71.91% to 51.58%, and the data leakage from shared gradients is reduced to the level of random guesses. Besides, FedSlice only introduces less than 2% accuracy loss and about 14% computation overhead. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper to discuss defense methods against these attacks to the CFL framework.","1558-1225","978-1-6654-5701-9","10.1109/ICSE48619.2023.00049","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62172009,62141208); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10172662","Deep Neural Networks;Software Engineering;Crowdsourcing;Federated Learning","Crowdsourcing;Privacy;Computational modeling;Artificial neural networks;Software;Data models;Encryption","","4","","88","IEEE","14 Jul 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

While due to streaming the way we listen to music and podcasts has changed drastically, there are very few studies about its Quality of Experience (QoE) and possible influence factors. From video QoE studies, we know that, for example, undesirable stops of the stream (stalling events) have a significant impact on QoE. However, the way in which music and video streaming is consumed differs significantly, as music is often played in the background, and thus, the influence of stalling could be significantly different. Thus, this work evaluates the impact of stalling on music streaming QoE. Therefore, we conduct two crowdsourced user studies: In the first study, users have to rate four songs with different stalling patterns and evaluate the degree of impairments. Afterwards, we compare the ratings to the results of a lab study and show that they are highly correlated, and that crowdsourcing is a suitable way of measuring music streaming QoE. In addition, we conduct a second crowdsourcing study to investigate the influence of the user's attentiveness on QoE. Here, participants have to listen to one song with two stalling events, while one half of them had to transcribe a handwritten text with music playing in the background. The attentiveness shows no influence on the perceived streaming quality, but it shows a significant influence on the perceived quality degradation due to stalling events. Furthermore, considerably more stalling events were missed for workers who focused on the transcription. These results are an important step towards establishing new methods for investigating QoE in multimedia.","2472-7814","978-1-7281-5965-2","10.1109/QoMEX48832.2020.9123118","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9123118","crowdsourcing;music QoE;user study;music streaming;audio;stalling","Crowdsourcing;Degradation;Atmospheric measurements;Music;Streaming media;Writing;Particle measurements","","4","","19","IEEE","23 Jun 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It's typically very time-consuming and money-consuming to get such kind of labeled data. Recently, crowdsourcing services provide an effective way to collect labeled data with much lower cost. Hence, crowdsourced learning (CL), which performs learning with labeled data collected from crowdsourcing services, has become a very hot and interesting research topic in recent years. Most existing CL methods exploit only the labels from different workers (annotators) for learning while ignoring the attributes of the instances. In many real applications, the attributes of the instances are actually the most discriminative information for learning. Hence, CL methods with attributes have attracted more and more attention from CL researchers. One representative model of such kind is the personal classifier (PC) model, which has achieved the state-of-the-art performance. However, the PC model makes an unreasonable assumption that all the workers contribute equally to the final classification. This contradicts the fact that different workers have different quality (ability) for data labeling. In this paper, we propose a novel model, called robust personal classifier (RPC), for robust crowdsourced learning. Our model can automatically learn an expertise score for each worker. This expertise score reflects the inherent quality of each worker. The final classifier of our RPC model gives high weights for good workers and low weights for poor workers or spammers, which is more reasonable than PC model with equal weights for all workers. Furthermore, the learned expertise score can be used to eliminate spammers or low-quality workers. Experiments on simulated datasets and UCI datasets show that the proposed model can dramatically outperform the baseline models such as PC model in terms of classification accuracy and ability to detect spammers.","","978-1-4799-1293-3","10.1109/BigData.2013.6691593","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6691593","crowdsourcing;crowdsourced learning;supervised learning","Training;Robustness;Logistics;Noise measurement;Labeling;Optimization;Accuracy","","4","","26","IEEE","23 Dec 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Despite the impact of a worker’s reputation on task completion, existing works do not offer a traceable and transparent reputation metric for lastmile delivery workers. This paper proposes a blockchain-based framework for reputation management in crowdsourced last-mile delivery. The proposed framework is designed as smart contracts that maintain and update crowdsourced workers’ information, mainly reputation, in a transparent and traceable manner. In addition, the framework allows requesters to create their delivery tasks and workers to get allocated available tasks.
