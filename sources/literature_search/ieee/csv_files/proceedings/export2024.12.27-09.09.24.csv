"Crowdsourcing Controller - Utilizing Reliable Agents in a Multiplayer Game","K. K. Lesniak; M. Maistro","University of Copenhagen and Dynasty Studios, Copenhagen, Denmark; University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark",2022 IEEE Conference on Games (CoG),"20 Sep 2022","2022","","","64","71","This paper presents a new use case for continuous crowdsourcing, where multiple players collectively control a single character in a video game. Similar approaches have already been proposed, but they suffer from certain limitations: (1) they simply consider static time frames to group real-time inputs from multiple players; (2) then they aggregate inputs with simple majority vote, i.e., each player is uniformly weighted. We present a continuous crowdsourcing multiplayer game equipped with our Crowdsourcing Controller. The Crowdsourcing Controller addresses the above-mentioned limitations: (1) our Dynamic Input Frame approach groups incoming players’ input in real-time by dynamically adjusting the frame length; (2) our Continuous Reliability System estimates players’ skills by assigning them a reliability score, which is later used in a weighted majority vote to aggregate the final output command. We evaluated our Crowdsourcing Controller offline with simulated players and online with real players. Offline and online experiments show that both components of our Crowdsourcing Controller lead to higher game scores, i.e., longer playing time. Moreover, the Crowdsourcing Controller is able to correctly estimate and update players’ reliability scores.","2325-4289","978-1-6654-5989-1","10.1109/CoG51982.2022.9893597","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9893597","Crowdsourcing;Multiplayer;Reliability system","Crowdsourcing;Aggregates;Games;Real-time systems;Reliability","","","","15","IEEE","20 Sep 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the exposure of crowd workers to potential privacy breaches during data collection diminishes their willingness to participate. This paper proposes TsIFedCrowd, a novel incentive mechanism within the federated learning paradigm, aimed at mitigating privacy risks for crowd workers while achieving high-quality crowdsourced data and learning models at minimal expense. TsIFedCrowd enables clients to retain privacy-sensitive data locally, requiring only the upload of trained models to the server, which aggregates them into a global model. By modeling the federated crowdsourcing process as a two-stage Stackelberg game, TsIFedCrowd incentivizes workers to complete tasks with heightened quality and efficiency. It also provides a timeliness selection mechanism, which makes TsIFedCrowd suitable for both real-time crowdsourcing, where the generation time of task results (data) needs to meet the established requirements of the application, and non-real-time crowdsourcing. TsIFedCrowd mandates clients to complete federated crowdsourcing tasks while maximizing utility for both clients and the server, achieved through Nash equilibrium resolution. TsIFedCrowd is also extended to the multiple heterogeneous federated crowdsourcing scenario. Extensive experiments demonstrate TsIFedCrowd’s effectiveness in ensuring incentive fairness and universality, accelerating convergence speed, and budget savings. Real-world crowdsourcing tasks further validate its efficacy.","2836-3868","979-8-3503-6855-0","10.1109/ICWS62655.2024.00083","National Natural Science Foundation of China; Southeast University; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10707528","crowdsourcing learning;federated learning;incentive mechanism;Stackelberg game;decentralized machine learning","Crowdsourcing;Training;Web services;Scalability;Games;Nash equilibrium;Privacy breach;Data models;Real-time systems;Servers","","","","40","IEEE","15 Oct 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As of 2018, crowdsourcing was used by 85% of the largest worldwide companies. This trend of crowdsourcing would be increasing as it offers numerous advantages to companies in achieving their goals, such as the capability of obtaining data and information from the crowd. The crowd-provided data and information contain the essence of human ingenuity, which enables companies to do problem-solving with a human-centered approach. The more contributors participate, the more likely the crowdsourcing program will succeed. Several studies give different lists of factors that influence the participation rate of the crowd. However, there’s a lack of discussion about the factors and it leads to a situation where organizations need to examine many factors when developing a crowdsourcing platform to get great crowd engagement. Therefore, this study conducted a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) to perform screening and analysis of preceding research systematically. The factors in each of these literatures are generated by considering the case of the study or the region of the people related to the research. This diversity helps identify the factors influencing contributor participation in data crowdsourcing from research all over the world. A study reflecting on these research findings would help answer research questions thoroughly. This study found that there are 19 factors that positively influence contributor participation in data crowdsourcing out of 26 factors found in the 16 selected documents.","","979-8-3503-4260-4","10.1109/ICIC60109.2023.10382018","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10382018","data crowdsourcing;contributors participation;participatory data collection;factors;Systematic Literature Review","Crowdsourcing;Systematics;Bibliographies;Companies;Market research;Reliability;Problem-solving","","","","66","IEEE","9 Jan 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Crowdsourcing is becoming an attractive technique to engage a diverse and large pool of subjects in experimental research, allowing researchers to achieve levels of scale and completion times that would otherwise not be feasible in lab settings. However, the scale and flexibility comes at the cost of multiple and sometimes unknown sources of bias and confounding factors that arise from technical limitations of crowdsourcing platforms and from the challenges of running controlled experiments in the “wild”. In this paper, we take our experience in running systematic evaluations of task design as a motivating example to explore, describe, and quantify the potential impact of running uncontrolled crowdsourcing experiments and derive possible coping strategies. Among the challenges identified, we can mention sampling bias, controlling the assignment of subjects to experimental conditions, learning effects, and reliability of crowdsourcing results. According to our empirical studies, the impact of potential biases and confounding factors can amount to a 38% loss in the utility of the data collected in uncontrolled settings; and it can significantly change the outcome of experiments. These issues ultimately inspired us to implement CrowdHub, a system that sits on top of major crowdsourcing platforms and allows researchers and practitioners to run controlled crowdsourcing projects.","","978-1-6654-1560-6","10.1109/CLEI52000.2020.00036","Russian Science Foundation(grant numbers:19-18-00282); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9458343","Crowdsourcing;Task Design;Controlled experiments;Crowdsourcing Platforms","Crowdsourcing;Systematics;Reliability;Task analysis;Open source software;Software development management","","","","56","IEEE","28 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Smartphones are one of the most promising platforms for mobile crowdsourcing for its heterogeneous communicating technologies, rich collection of embedded sensors, and relatively high processing and storage power in comparison with wireless sensors. One of the major challenges of mobile crowdsourcing is to guarantee successful transmissions from a large number of smartphones that are affected by dynamic user mobility. Therefore, an efficient scheduling algorithm that incorporates human mobility is needed to successfully collect mobile crowdsourcing data from a large scale of smartphones. In this paper, a mobility prediction-based scheduling framework is proposed to support a large-scale crowdsourcing data collection from smartphones under IEEE 802.11ah which supports the concept of the Internet of Things by providing long-range communication and low energy consumption. The predicted future locations of mobile nodes are used to prioritize mobile nodes and to find mobile nodes that are potentially moving away from the base station during the scheduling process. The performance evaluation under a realistic human mobility model shows that mobility patterns significantly affect the performance of mobile crowdsourcing and the proposed scheduling approach can achieve higher throughput and lower packet loss rate in comparison with other scheduling approaches.","","978-1-7281-0960-2","10.1109/GCWkshps45667.2019.9024440","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9024440","","Mobile nodes;Crowdsourcing;Scheduling;Smart phones;Sensors;Data collection","","","","17","IEEE","5 Mar 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Due to concerns about human errors in crowdsourcing, it is necessary to infer the truth from the answers of multiple crowdsourcing workers. Traditional truth inference algorithms treat truth inference as a probability generation process and model the conditional dependency between variables. However, the fly in the ointment is that we need to make delicate assumptions about the priors of various variables for these methods. Additionally, the design of the generation process is also complex extraordinarily. With the popularity of graph neural networks, existing works try to exploit graph neural networks to solve the truth inference problem in crowdsourcing. Nevertheless, one edge in traditional graph structures can only connect two nodes which simply expresses the pairwise relationships, but ignores the high-order relationships among multiple nodes in the truth inference problem. Therefore, we propose a novel strategy which exploits the hypergraph neural network to solve the truth inference in crowdsourcing. We construct a hypergraph which contains task nodes, worker nodes, and candidate answer nodes and derive a new hypergraph neural network to learn the representations of nodes and the true labels. Besides, we exploit the latent correlation information between nodes of same types. In this paper, we explain our method through a case study.","","978-1-6654-6297-6","10.1109/DASC/PiCom/CBDCom/Cy55231.2022.9927903","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9927903","truth inference;high-order relationships;hypergraph neural networks;true labels","Crowdsourcing;Correlation;Design methodology;Big Data;Inference algorithms;Noise measurement;Task analysis","","","","44","IEEE","13 Dec 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To help the integration process, it is of significant interest to understand the challenges that are encountered by client developers. Developer forums and Stack Overflow are commonly used by client developers to seek help from fellow peers. In this paper, we mine both developer forums and Stack Overflow to find the common challenges encountered by client developers. We perform an empirical study on 32 Web APIs with a total of 92,471 discussions. To extract topics from all discussions, we apply a topic modeling technique called Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). The results show that on average five dominant topics can cover at least 50% of questions regarding each Web API. We further investigate how topics evolve across Web APIs, and find five patterns.

Two important solutions are DupPredictor and Dupe. Despite reporting significant results, both works do not provide their implementations publicly available, hindering subsequent works in scientific literature which rely on them. We executed an empirical study as a reproduction of DupPredictor and Dupe.

Our approach takes the API method’s name as an input and generates a natural language summary based on Stack Overflow discussions of that API method. We have conducted a survey that involves 16 Android developers to evaluate the quality of our automatically generated summaries and compare them with the official Android documentation.Our results demonstrate that while developers find the official documentation more useful in general, the generated summaries are also competitive, in particular for offering implementation details, and can be used as a complementary source for guiding developers in software development and maintenance tasks.","2470-6892","978-1-6654-4897-0","10.1109/SCAM52516.2021.00026","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9610724","code summarization;unsupervised learning;unofficial documentation;survey;professional developers","Codes;Conferences;Natural languages;Documentation;Maintenance engineering;Software;Task analysis","","5","","40","IEEE","24 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we show how a vulnerable program can be used to create a covert channel that allows an entity (e.g., an attacker) to stealthily send information to another remote entity (e.g., a backdoor). The proposed covert channel, for which we coin the term OverCovert, is based on the common return-to-libc stack-overflow attack and the address space layout randomization defense. We implemented a proof-of-concept of OverCovert under Linux and evaluated its throughput sending files of different formats.

Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) is an emerging practice to manage cloud infrastructure resources for software systems. Modern software development has evolved to embrace IaC as a best practice for consistently provisioning and managing infrastructure using various tools such as Terraform and Ansible. However, recent studies highlighted that developers still encounter various challenges with IaC tools. Aims. We aim in this paper to understand the different challenges that developers encounter with IaC and analyze the trend of seeking assistance on Q&A platforms in the context of IaC. To this end, we conduct a large-scale empirical study investigating developers' discussions in Stack Overflow. Method. We first collect IaC-relevant tags on Stack Overflow, constituting a dataset that comprises 52,692 questions and 64,078 answers. Then, we group questions into specific topics using the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) method, which we optimize using a Genetic Algorithm (GA) for parameter's fine-tuning. Finally, to gain better insights, we analyze the identified topics based on different criteria such as popularity and difficulty. Results. Our findings reveal an average yearly increase of 150% in terms of IaC-related questions and 135% in terms of users between 2011 and 2022. Furthermore, we observe that IaC questions revolve around seven main topics: server configuration, policy configuration, networking, deployment pipelines, variable management, templating, and file management. Notably, we found that server configuration and file management are the most popular topics, i.e., the most discussed among IaC developers, while the deployment pipelines and templating topics are the most difficult. Conclusions. Our results shed light on IaC challenges that are often encountered by developers on popular Q&A platforms. These findings reveal important implications for practitioners seeking better support for IaC tools in real-world settings and for researchers to better understand the IaC community needs and further investigate IaC in different aspects.","","978-1-6654-5223-6","10.1109/ESEM56168.2023.10304847","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)(grant numbers:RGPIN-2018-05960); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10304847","Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC);Stack Overflow;Topic Modeling;Developers Discussions","Pipelines;Software systems;Market research;Servers;Software measurement;Resource management;Best practices","","3","","96","IEEE","8 Nov 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For example, when a user checks in at a shop on Facebook, he will immediately receive and is asked to complete a set of tasks such as ""what is the opening hour of the shop"". It is non-trivial to complete a set of tasks timely and accurately via spatial crowdsourcing. Since workers in spatial crowdsourcing are often transient and limited in number, these social media platforms need to properly allocate workers within the set of tasks such that all tasks are completed (i) with high quality and (ii) with a minimal latency (estimated by the arriving index of the last recruited worker). Solutions to quality and latency control in traditional crowdsourcing are inapplicable in this problem because they either assume sufficient workers or ignore the spatiotemporal factors. In this work, we define the Latency-oriented Task Completion (LTC) problem, which trades off quality and latency (number of workers) of task completion in spatial crowdsourcing. We prove that the LTC problem is NP-hard. We first devise a minimum-cost-flow based algorithm with a constant approximation ratio for the LTC problem in the offline scenario, where all information is known a prior. Then we study the more practical online scenario of the LTC problem, where workers appear dynamically and the platform needs to arrange tasks for each worker immediately based on partial information. We design two greedy-based algorithms with competitive ratio guarantees to solve the LTC problem in the online scenario. Finally, we validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed solutions through extensive evaluations on both synthetic and real-world datasets.","2375-026X","978-1-5386-5520-7","10.1109/ICDE.2018.00037","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8509258","spatial crowdsourcing;latency control","Task analysis;Crowdsourcing;Facebook;Error analysis;Approximation algorithms;Transient analysis","","48","","26","IEEE","25 Oct 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A key feature of these tasks is that they are all simple tasks even decision making tasks. People can deal with these tasks with common sense knowledge. However, different from crowdsourcing in a general domain, software crowdsourcing is more complex. Only people with software developing skills can finish these tasks which could take a long time. Thus, an essential component of building a successful software crowdsourcing platform is effective developer recommendation, which aims to match a given task to the right crowdworkers. In order to solve this problem, in this paper, we propose a learning to rank framework. Specifically, we first propose a CRF-based model to extract criterias (i.e. skills and locations) from descriptions. Task characteristics learned from their descriptions and developer' characteristic distributions extracted from their historical tasks are fed into our learning to rank algorithms for developer recommendation together with some other features such as topic-based features.

However, crowdsourcing of software development is still not widely adopted. A key barrier to adoption is a lack of confidence that a task will be completed on time with the required quality standards. While good managers can develop good, intuitive estimates of task completion when assigning work to their team members, they might lack similar intuition for individuals drawn from an online crowd. The phrase, ""Post and Hope"" is thus sometimes used when talking about the crowdsourcing of software-development tasks. The objective of this paper is to show the value of replacing the traditional, intuitive assessment of a team's capability with a quantitative assessment of the crowd, derived through analysis of historical performance on similar tasks. This analysis will serve to transform ""Post and Hope"" to ""Post and Expect."" We demonstrate this by analyzing data about tasks performed on two popular crowdsourcing platforms: Topcoder and Upwork.

Truth discovery and incentive mechanism are fundamentally important for the crowdsourcing system. Many truth discovery methods and incentive mechanisms for crowdsourcing have been proposed. However, most of them cannot be applied to dealing with the crowdsourcing with copiers. To address the issue, we formulate the problem of maximizing the social welfare such that all tasks can be completed with the least confidence for truth discovery. We design an incentive mechanism consisting of truth discovery stage and reverse auction stage. In truth discovery stage, we estimate the truth for each task based on both the dependence and accuracy of workers. In reverse auction stage, we design a greedy algorithm to select the winners and determine the payment. Through both rigorous theoretical analysis and extensive simulations, we demonstrate that the proposed mechanisms achieve computational efficiency, individual rationality, truthfulness, and guaranteed approximation. Moreover, our truth discovery method shows prominent advantage in terms of precision when there are copiers in the crowdsourcing systems.","2575-8411","978-1-7281-2519-0","10.1109/ICDCS.2019.00129","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8885399","crowdsourcing;truth discovery;incentive mechanism;reverse auction;Bayesian analysis","Crowdsourcing;Task analysis;Computational modeling;Analytical models;Sensors;Google;Estimation","","16","","36","IEEE","31 Oct 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In order to study the competitive behaviours for software crowdsourcing, we apply the famous game theory to model the 2-player algorithm challenges on TopCoder. And as all the participants are aware of other players' information and they make decisions almost simultaneously, this article adopts the theory of static games with complete information. Through Nash equilibria computing, we find that the value of successfully challenging probability can be used to deduce specific competitive decisions of coders in the algorithm challenge stage. Specifically, if a coder's probability to make a successful challenge exceeds some certain value, then he will always choose to challenge.

Tasks in crowdsourcing systems with specialized work have multiple steps and each step requires multiple skills. Steps may have different flexibilities in terms of obtaining service from one or multiple agents, due to varying levels of dependency among parts of steps. Steps of a task may have precedence constraints among them. Moreover, there are variations in loads of different types of tasks requiring different skill-sets and availabilities of different types of agents with different skill-sets. Considering these constraints together necessitates the design of novel schemes to allocate steps to agents. In addition, large crowdsourcing systems require allocation schemes that are simple, fast, decentralized and offer customers (task requesters) the freedom to choose agents. In this work we study the performance limits of such crowdsourcing systems and propose efficient allocation schemes that provably meet the performance limits under these additional requirements. We demonstrate our algorithms on data from a crowdsourcing platform run by a non-profit company and show significant improvements over current practice.","","978-1-4673-9953-1","10.1109/INFOCOM.2016.7524615","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7524615","","Crowdsourcing;Resource management;Companies;Computer science;Numerical models;Stochastic processes;Conferences","","11","","22","IEEE","28 Jul 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, due to limited budgets and limited availability of workers in practice, the data collected is often incomplete, incurring data deficiency problem. To tackle that, in this work, we first propose an entropy-based quality metric, which captures the joint effects of incompletion in data acquisition and the imprecision in data interpolation. Based on that, we investigate quality-aware task assignment methods for both single- and multi-task scenarios. We show the NP-hardness of the single-task case, and design polynomial-time algorithms with guaranteed approximation ratios. We study novel indexing and pruning techniques for further enhancing the performance in practice.

The Comparison Category Rating (CCR) is another standard approach in which participants listen to both reference and processed stimuli and rate their quality compared to the other one. The CCR method is particularly suitable for systems that improve the quality of input speech. This paper evaluates an adaptation of the CCR test procedure for assessing speech quality in the crowdsourcing set-up. The CCR method was introduced in the ITU-T Rec.

Quality assurance significantly impacts project costs. However the literature lacks defined ways to estimate costs of quality and guidelines for selecting the most cost-effective mechanism. In this paper we introduce cost models, which may be used to estimate crowdsourcing costs and act as a guideline to efficiently utilize quality assurance mechanisms. These models were developed through a Cost of Quality (CoQ) approach, which has been widely used in total quality management since the 1970's.

First, we develop a model for common crowdsourcing platforms and implement the model using a simulative approach, which is validated with a comparison to an analytic M[X]/M/c - ∞ system. In a second step, we evaluate inter-arrival times as well as campaign size distributions based on a dataset of a large commercial crowdsourcing platform to derive realistic model parameters and illustrate the differences to the analytic approximation. Finally, we perform a parameter study using the simulation model to derive guidelines for dimensioning crowdsourcing platforms, while considering relevant parameters for the involved stakeholders, i.e., the delay before work on a task begins and the work load of the workers.","","978-1-4673-9348-5","10.1109/ATNAC.2015.7366785","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7366785","","Crowdsourcing;Analytical models;Cloud computing;Delays;Computational modeling;Load modeling","","4","","8","IEEE","4 Jan 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This type of behaviours extremely reduces the enthusiasm of honest users, which may lead a crowdsourcing platform to a failure. To defend the threats from spam workers, reputation-based defense mechanisms and verification-based defense mechanisms have been proposed in crowdsourcing environments. However, reputation-based defense fails to indicate the trust level of a worker who boosts its reputation by transacting with his/her accomplices. In addition, verification-based defense is costly and ineffective when facing a large number of spam workers with ""good"" reputations. Thus, it is a challenging problem to effectively defend the threats from spam workers. In this paper, we propose a new trust vector-based threat defense model CrowdDefense. Firstly, we build a Crowdsourcing Trust Network (CTN) consisting of requesters, workers and their transaction relations. Then, we analyze three threat patterns of spam workers. Based on the analysis, we infer the trust relation between a worker and a requester who are indirectly linked with each other. Moreover, we compute a worker's trust relations with different requesters, and present them in a new Worker Trust Vector (WTV) that indicates the worker's global trust. As spam workers always succeed in the transactions with their accomplices, they cannot obtain comprehensively good trust scores in their WTVs and thus are prevented from participating in tasks. The experiments demonstrate that CrowdsDefense significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches in terms of preventing spam workers from participating in the tasks published by honest requesters.","","978-1-5386-0752-7","10.1109/ICWS.2017.39","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8029768","Crowdsourcing;Trust Vector;Trust Inference;Spam Worker;Threat Defense","Crowdsourcing;Testing;Australia;Lead;Social network services;Conferences;Web services","","4","","23","IEEE","11 Sep 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Despite the opportunities, there are also challenges faced by crowd workers, who can be anybody including women. Women are one of the specific targeted groups identified to support Malaysia’s economic growth. To fully harness the benefits of spatial crowdsourcing trends for women, it is necessary to understand the factors that motivate them to participate in spatial crowdsourcing platform since it is still in the infancy state. This paper presents the preliminary exploratory study using semi-structured interviews to investigate the women’s motivational factors to participate in spatial crowdsourcing platforms.

This paper first studies a practical problem of task assignment, namely reliability aware spatial crowdsourcing (RA-SC), which takes the constrained tasks and numerous dynamic workers into consideration. Specifically, the worker confidence is introduced to reflect the completion reliability of the assigned task. Our RA-SC problem is to perform task assignments such that the reliability under budget constraints is maximized.

The lack of centralized supervision requires all kinds of system nodes to voluntarily participate while their behaviors are profit-driven and unpredictable, thus introducing challenges to system performance. Moreover, the nodes in a decentralized crowdsourcing system inherently observe little information about the system status; therefore, it is difficult for them to discover and adopt theoretically optimal strategies. Current literature still lacks an effective mechanism to motivate the participation of all types of nodes. To this end, this paper employs a two-layer game model to simulate the interactions in the decentralized crowdsourcing system for investigating the participation willingness of different system nodes. Specifically, we apply a Stackelberg game to model the interactions of a crowdsourcing requester and other nodes, where the requester decides its reward policy and the others respond by selecting their roles to play. In addition, the interaction of the bounded rational other nodes is further represented as an evolutionary game. After analyzing the game model, we further design an incentive mechanism to maximize the requester utility while motivating other nodes to actively participate in the crowdsourcing. Through experimental simulations, we verify the effectiveness of the proposed incentive mechanism.","2576-6813","978-1-6654-3540-6","10.1109/GLOBECOM48099.2022.10000939","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62072351); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10000939","blockchain;crowdsourcing;evolutionary game;Stackelberg game;incentive mechanism","Crowdsourcing;System performance;Scalability;Games;Stability analysis;Delays;Blockchains","","2","","18","IEEE","11 Jan 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Finding the optimal global assignment turns out to be intractable since it does not simply imply optimality for an individual worker, as a typical nearest-neighbor heuristic does not render a satisfactory result in general. In spatial crowdsourcing, we model the task assignment problem as a multiple objective joint optimization problem, which focuses on maximizing accomplished task rate and minimizing travel time cost rate simultaneously, and solves it with a mixed priority queue scheduling algorithm. We also introduce a spectral clustering algorithm in spatial crowdsourcing for the first time to divide the task network into different subdomains, considering the task clustering phenomena in real scenarios.

In addition, most of the existing crowdsourcing systems rely on the central server and are vulnerable to a single point of failure, affecting users’ trust in the system. To solve the above problems, this paper proposes a trusted distributed crowdsourcing framework based on user preferences. Firstly, we propose a trust model of identifying malicious users (IMU) based on reputation value, which can quickly identify all kinds of malicious users. Secondly, the framework is based on an open, transparent, and tamperproof consortium blockchain to ensure the security and reliability of transaction information, and has developed a complete service process for it. Finally, this paper also takes into account the different preferences of users, and gives priority to the tasks that best meet users’ preferences to improve user satisfaction.

Based on BPS data in 2015, there were 6238 intangible and 1413 tangible cultural heritage [1]. Ironically with this great wealth, the 2014 Podes survey shows that Indonesian participation in cultural visits and cultural performances is very low (5-15%) [2]. So it is not surprising that about 127 of Indonesian intangible cultural heritage are on the verge of extinction, one of which is the result of the low level of cultural socialization among the community. Cultural socialization can actually be done through internet media considering that the public's exposure to devices and the internet is increasing year by year[3]. However, the cultural data available on the internet has not been integrated so that it cannot be optimally utilized. Data on cultural heritage is currently spread to many parties: cultural institutions such as museums; cultural community; and individuals. Data on cultural heritage in individuals are prone to be lost if it is not stored and/or inherited. The problem is, how to collect data that is spread everywhere and then store it in a structure that can answer questions such as the number of cultures that exist, statistics, cultural distribution regarding geographical location, and kinship relations between one culture and another. Facing this problem, crowdsourcing is a solution opportunity that allows data collection from many parties. Crowdsourcing is a new way of utilizing human resources spread throughout the world to do certain jobs. The low-quality problem of crowdsourcing technology can be handled by combining crowdsourcing systems with automatic classification algorithms or with procedure or algorithm to select the appropriate worker due to their performance. In this study, a crowdsourcing machine will be built to collect heritage cultural data from various sources. The collected data is stored in an ontology format that can answer questions: statistics on cultural data, number of current cultures, geographical distribution of cultural objects, and intercultural kinship.","","978-1-5386-6921-1","10.1109/IAC.2018.8780481","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8780481","crowdsourcing;cultural heritage;data collecting","Crowdsourcing;Cultural differences;Task analysis;Global communication;Information services;Electronic publishing","","1","","23","IEEE","1 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the process in conducting an SR remains laborious-intensive and expensive, specially in terms of hours that SR researchers dedicate. It is worth exploring approaches to conduct SRs at lower costs (quicker, using less resources - time of researchers). One such approach is crowdsourcing, since conducting SRs activities among a large number of researchers is a promising alternative to reduce costs associated to SR conduction. Goal: The main goal of this study is to identify and summarize the body of knowledge on crowdsourcing to support the conduction of SRs in SE. Method: Two empirical research methods were used. Initially, we conducted a Systematic Mapping to identify the available and relevant studies on crowdsourcing in SRs in SE. Secondly, a survey was performed with 39 SE researchers aiming to identify their perception related to the value of performing SRs collaboratively. Results: Our results show that how to speed up the SR process; reduce bias through broad participation; and expand team expertise were most potential benefits linked to the use of crowdsourcing in SR. The main challenges were associated with quality control to ensure the quality of results. Conclusions: In spite of the challenges, we believe that crowdsourcing could be successfully employed in SR context. More empirical research is needed on how to use crowdsourcing to support SR conduction in SE and how to minimize the identified challenges.","","978-1-7281-9532-2","10.1109/SEAA51224.2020.00072","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9226329","Systematic Review;SR;Systematic Mapping;SM;Crowdsourcing","Crowdsourcing;Systematics;Software engineering;Task analysis;World Wide Web;Search problems;Outsourcing","","1","","33","IEEE","16 Oct 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

CWs can share their experience working for various CSPs, which forms the basis of CSP reputation score. This information can be used for trust building and facilitating future CWs’ decisions on which CSP to work for. Existing reputation management research in crowdsourcing has mainly focused on controlling task quality and improving revenue from the perspective of CSPs. Little attention has been paid to helping CSPs manage their reputation to attract and retain CWs. In this paper, we propose the Crowdsourcing Service Provider Reputation Management (CSP-RM) framework to bridge this important gap. Based on the current reputation of CSPs, it dynamically balances the trade-off between the reputation maintenance cost and the long-term profit for a given CSP. It performs dynamic commission allocation for a CSP based on Lyapunov optimization to guide the recruitment of CWs, while considering the revenue and the changes in the number of CWs. Extensive experiments based on highly competitive crowdsourcing market demonstrate that CSP-RM makes the most advantageous cost-benefit trade-off compared to existing approaches, outperforming the best baseline by 23.83%, 39.21% and 3.36% in terms of average cumulative revenue, average number of CWs and public reputation, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first decision support framework for enabling CSPs to recruit more CWs in a highly competitive market, while maintaining their reputation and ensuring long-term benefit.","2836-3868","979-8-3503-0485-5","10.1109/ICWS60048.2023.00035","National Research Foundation Singapore; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10248265","crowdsourcing service provider;reputation management;Lyapunov optimization;crowd worker motivation;dynamic commission allocation.","Crowdsourcing;Costs;Web services;Buildings;Maintenance engineering;Dynamic scheduling;Resource management","","1","","27","IEEE","19 Sep 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we developed a competence identification framework to analyze and recognize SPs' competence in online knowledge-intensive crowdsourcing (KIC) context. We firstly crawled the experience sharing articles, which contained excellent SPs' experiences and ideas about the efforts that should be made to be successful, from several Chinese online crowdsourcing communities and then text mining techniques were applied to analyze these unstructured texts. Each sentence in the corpora was tokenized into several words, after which the words were clustered as different topics using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model based on their underlying semantics. Furthermore, based on the LDA outputs, we identified six clusters of crowdsourcing SPs' competence and thus constructed the competence system on the basis of Spencer's competence dictionary and human intervention.

In this paper, we consider that the crowd-sourcer would like to allocate tasks to several different sub-markets with a shared budget. The crowdsourcer wants to maximize her utility through the crowdsourcing campaign with certain budget constraint. We design two optimization objectives for our problem, maximin and weighted average.

Crowdsourcing workers are hired to perform video analytics tasks and then rewarded based on the quality of their work. However, the crowdsourcing platform may face several challenges when assigning video analytics tasks to appropriate workers: jointly optimizing analytics accuracy and energy-related resource utilization is challenging due to the inherent uncertainty in accuracy and constraints imposed by workers’ configurations; workers’ analytics accuracy reflects their privacy information, including their devices’ computing capabilities, which must be protected. Considering those challenges for video analytics crowdsourcing, we first formulate an online optimization problem that maximizes profits based on accuracy within a limited budget of energy-related resource. To tackle it, we design a budget-limited multi-armed bandit-based algorithm Soteria for video dispatch, which captures the changes in analytics accuracy and then exploits them by efficiently solving knapsack problems. Besides, a δ-differential privacy mechanism is introduced to guarantee workers’ privacy. We prove Soteria’s effectiveness in setting a regret bound, and extensive experiments show the superior performance of Soteria compared to others in terms of crowdsourcing utilities by up to 9.7%.","","979-8-3503-8990-6","10.1109/MICCIS63508.2024.00034","State Grid Corporation of China; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10625757","mobile crowdsourcing;video analytics;multi-armed bandit;differential privacy","Crowdsourcing;Performance evaluation;Privacy;Accuracy;Uncertainty;Visual analytics;Mobile handsets","","","","31","IEEE","15 Aug 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Because of the significance of incentivizing worker participation in crowdsourcing system, the correlative theories of auction-based incentive mechanisms have been proposed in past literature. Combinatorial auctions can be used to reach efficient resource and task allocations in Multi-agent systems where the items are complementary or substitutable. Although many good auction-based incentive mechanisms can attract more participation, facing a large-scale of complex social perception tasks in the market, a combinatorial auction mechanism which simply relies on to allocate resources is not efficiently. In order to solve this problem, we design two algorithm models to classify all crowdsourcing-tasks into many groups according to the intentions that the workers provided, and then the workers and the crowdsourcing platform start the combinatorial auction for each task-group.

The framework is designed for open crowd platforms and enables to map a given requester SLA to worker SA requirements and select crowd workers who evince high probability of SA requirement fulfillment. Even with these select crowd workers, it might not be possible to implicitly assume the sustenance of workers' expected SA (which is computed based on workers' prior task executions) in the day to day task executions on the Enterprise Requester tasks, owing to the unbinding task execution facilitated by the open crowd platforms. This might result in defaulting in requester SLA fulfillment, rendering the worker selection (by the framework) futile. Hence, in addition to selecting the required SA fulfilling workers, it is essential to employ suitable SA sustaining strategies in place for sustaining the SA expected of workers.

FedCS aggregates model parameters from clients to build a shared server model while keeping the training data locally on worker devices to protect data privacy. To mitigate the staleness of stragglers and boost efficiency, we introduce a semi-asynchronous federated crowdsourcing mechanism, where the parameter server performs global aggregation periodically. Moreover, due to the different frequencies of workers participating in asynchronous update, FedCS uses a staleness-aware grouping and weighted aggregation heuristic to balance the training process. To speed up the convergence rate and improve the training accuracy, FedCS deploys adaptive learning step size for worker devices by their participation frequency. We further present a task assignment algorithm to help workers choose worthy and suitable tasks for annotations and to save the budget.

A number of trends under the broad banner of crowdsourcing are beginning to fundamentally disrupt the way in which software is engineered. Programmers increasingly rely on crowdsourced knowledge and code, as they look to Q&A sites for answers or use code from publicly posted snippets. Programmers play, compete, and learn with the crowd, engaging in programming competitions and puzzles with crowds of programmers. Online IDEs make possible radically new forms of collaboration, allowing developers to synchronously program with crowds of distributed programmers. Programmers' reputation is increasingly visible on Q&A sites and public code repositories, opening new possibilities in how developers find jobs and companies identify talent. Crowds of non-programmers increasingly participate in development, usability testing software or even constructing specifications while playing games. Crowdfunding democratizes choices about which software is built, broadening the software which might be feasibly constructed. Approaches for crowd development seek to microtask software development, dramatically increasing participation in open source by enabling software projects to be built through casual, transient work. The 4th International Workshop on CrowdSourcing in Software Engineering (CSI-SE) seeks to understand how crowdsourcing is shaping and disrupting software development, shedding light on the opportunities and challenges.

Using this paradigm, ordinary citizens can collect multi-modal data streams from the surrounding environment using their mobile devices and share the same using existing communication infrastructure (e.g., 3G service or WiFi access points). The data contributed from multiple participants can be combined to build a spatiotemporal view of the phenomenon of interest and also to extract important community statistics. Given the ubiquity of mobile phones and the high density of people in metropolitan areas, participatory sensing can achieve an unprecedented level of coverage in both space and time for observing events of interest in urban spaces. Several exciting participatory sensing applications have emerged in recent years. For example, GPS traces uploaded by drivers and passengers can be used to generate real time traffic statistics. Similarly, street-level audio samples collected by pedestrians can be aggregated to create a citywide noise map. In this advanced seminar, we will provide a comprehensive overview of this new and exciting paradigm and outline the major research challenges.","2375-0324","978-0-7695-4436-6","10.1109/MDM.2011.16","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6068482","participatory sensing;crowdsourcing;mobile sensing","Sensors;Mobile handsets;Monitoring;Noise;Pollution measurement;Context;Roads","","143","","13","IEEE","3 Nov 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In crowd sourcing paradigm, tasks are distributed to networked people to complete such that a company¡¦s production cost can be greatly reduced. A crowd sourcing process involves operations of both requesters and workers. A requester submits a task request, a worker selects and completes a task, and the requester only pays the worker for the successful completion of the task. Obviously, it is not efficient that the amount of time spent on selecting a task is comparable with that spent on working on a task, but the monetary reward of a task is just a small amount. Literature mainly focused on exploring what type of tasks can be deployed to the crowd and analyzing the performance of crowd sourcing platforms. However, no existing work investigates on how to support workers to select tasks on crowd sourcing platforms easily and effectively. In this paper, we propose a novel idea on task matching in crowd sourcing to motivate workers to keep on working on crowd sourcing platforms in long run. The idea utilizes the past task preference and performance of a worker to produce a list of available tasks in the order of best matching with the worker during his task selection stage. It aims to increase the efficiency of task completion. We present some preliminary experimental results in case studies. Finally, we address the possible challenges and discuss the future directions.","","978-1-4577-1976-9","10.1109/iThings/CPSCom.2011.128","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6142254","crowdsourcing;task model;task matching algorithm","USA Councils;Humans;Conferences;Production;Business;Computational modeling;History","","51","2","11","IEEE","2 Feb 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We apply keywords modelling to the annotation data collected in the framework of Commandaria project where sixteen non-expert users annotated a set of a hundred images using a predefined set of keywords.

Finally, the created models used to classify the images into the keyword classes in terms of 2-classes combinations using the 10-fold cross-validation technique.
