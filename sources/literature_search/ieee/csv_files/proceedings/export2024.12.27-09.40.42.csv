Increased data transfer speeds, reduced latency, and extended bandwidths enable the true power of 5G networks. To support increased bandwidths cellular industry looked to high-frequency bands with high data rates in the spectrum above 24 GHz which are typically called “millimeter waves”. The introduction of millimeter waves reduces the coverage radius drastically due to high penetration losses and the blocking nature of this wave spectrum. The reduced coverage radius causes higher infrastructure costs for the network providers. This research will focus on a crowdsourcing mechanism where network data is collected through a mobile application and use this data to generate a real-time network coverage map. In addition, collected data will be used to predict future network quality demands and locations for cell towers with the help of machine learning technologies. The outcome of this research will be beneficial to network providers to reduce infrastructure costs by optimally laying infrastructures.","2644-3163","978-1-6654-0066-4","10.1109/IEMCON53756.2021.9623247","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9623247","5G;Infrastructure;heat map;millimeter waves","Industries;Costs;5G mobile communication;Millimeter wave technology;Poles and towers;Computer architecture;Bandwidth","","1","","25","IEEE","6 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"Designing Incentives for Crowdsourced Tasks via Multi-armed Bandits","A. Itoh; S.

So far, researchers studied the effects of various incentives including financial and social ones. The effect of these incentives, however, may differ in different tasks and/or at a different time, which makes difficult to find an appropriate incentive out of the whole design space of incentives is difficult. To overcome this difficulty, we take a data-driven approach instead of trying to find a universally effective incentive. More specifically, we apply MAB algorithms to the incentive design problem. MAB problems are a theoretical model of exploration-exploitation tradeoffs in reinforcement learning. We evaluated the effects of the nine incentives by using the task of word search puzzles published on Amazon Mechanical Turk. Based on the obtained data, we further evaluated the performance of typical MAB algorithms by simulation. The results show that applying the MAB algorithms are effective to obtain the appropriate incentive design.","","978-1-5090-3931-9","10.1109/ICA.2016.024","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7812969","","Crowdsourcing;Algorithm design and analysis;Conferences;Informatics;Electronic mail;Learning (artificial intelligence);Data models","","1","","3","IEEE","16 Jan 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A key issue is to allow people to identify their own incomprehension. We applied a microtask approach to the problem and verified that the developed workflow was effective.

Data augmentation is a popular solution to address this need. We explore crowdsourcing as a solution for training a deep neural network (DNN) for lesion detection. Our solution employs a strategy to overcome the noisy nature of crowdsourced annotations by i) assigning a reliability factor for each subject of the crowd based on their performance (at global and local levels) and experience and ii) requiring region of interest (ROI) markings rather than pixel-level markings from the crowd. We present a solution for training the DNN with data drawn from a heterogeneous mixture of annotations, namely, very limited number of pixel-level markings by experts and crowdsourced ROI markings. Experimental results obtained for hard exudate detection from color fundus images show that training with processed/refined crowdsourced data is effective as detection performance improves by 25% over training with just expert-markings and by 11% over training with annotation derived using majority voting among the crowd.","2327-0985","978-1-5386-3354-0","10.1109/ACPR.2017.6","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8575917","Crowdsourcing;Reliability Factor;Deep Neural Net","Training;Radio frequency;Solid modeling;Reliability;Crowdsourcing;Information technology;Biomedical imaging","","1","","17","IEEE","16 Dec 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This concept paper advocates a hybrid hierarchy system for IAQ monitoring that incorporates both offline and online connectivity. The system utilizes sensing elements that can perform a wide range of functions, including autocalibration, pollution event detection, and more, autonomously from the network. By combining a gateway device, the system's capabilities are enhanced, providing increased data granularity, additional calibration and sensing options as well as connection with Building Management Systems (BMS). Furthermore, by connecting the gateway to the cloud, the system can perform more advanced data analysis and machine learning, providing users with insights into not only air quality but also general environmental quality.

To this end, we use a pre-trained object detection neural network to count vehicles within images. We then compare the results with human annotations gathered through crowdsourcing campaigns. We use this comparison to assess performance and calibrate the neural network annotations. The performance of our system allows us to consider applications which can monitor the traffic conditions in near real-time, making the counting usable for traffic-related services.

As a result, there are risks of agent safety such as the disclosures of agent identity and location. Hence, in this research, a solution is proposed to detect agent data confidentiality violations that occur during runtime.

Indoor positioning is one of the most sought-after indoor technologies, as most indoor services require position information to provide highquality, low-latency services. As a result, the indoor positioning field is also contributing to the rapid development of the IoT by using objects as sources of information to assist in tracking. This paper describes the development and evaluation of a lowcost indoor positioning approach using the Internet of Things (IoT) and received signal strength (RSS) based on UWB-OFDM technology. The proposed approach aims to simplify complex tasks and improve the quality of indoor services by providing accurate and low-latency position information. We introduce the Mobile Access Point Model (MAPM), an optimization algorithm that reduces the negative impact of multipath on the system quality through crowdsourcing. We evaluated the MAPM model in a real-world setting using a Wi-Fi node, which scans the user-reinforced access point and calculates the distance using the scanned RSSI. The node sends the necessary data to the server for software processing, and the server uses the received distances to calculate the position information and store the data in the system database. The evaluation results showed that the proposed MAPM model reduced the negative impact of multipath (reduces NLOS conditions) by 63%, and the root mean square error (RMSE) of the proposed approach using a Wi-Fi node was 69.52 cm.

The biopsy diagnosis is non-trivial, and specialists often disagree on the final diagnosis. Thus, Computer-aided Diagnosis–(CAD) systems favor the efficiency of this process while reducing the diagnosis time. However, such systems often require large labeled datasets to achieve meaningful performance, which is hard to obtain in medicine. Crowdsourcing approaches deal with this scenario by collecting labels from multiple annotators with varying degrees of expertise. This work explores the application of a multi-annotator for breast cancer tissue classification using a dataset annotated by experts and non-experts. In particular, we tested two loss functions based on a cross-s-entropy function (RCDNN) and a generalized cross-entropy function (GCEDL). Comparative results underscore the challenges posed by the multi-annotator scenario, with the GCECDL model emerging as the most robust, achieving performance levels approaching those of a gold-standard single-annotator model.","2694-0604","979-8-3503-7149-9","10.1109/EMBC53108.2024.10782427","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10782427","Crowdsourcing;digital pathology;breast cancer;multiple annotator model;noise mitigation","Deep learning;Training;Uncertainty;Prevention and mitigation;Gaussian processes;Probabilistic logic;Breast cancer;Data models;Medical diagnostic imaging;Immune system","","","","16","IEEE","17 Dec 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Training data can contain faults, especially when collected through crowdsourcing. Ensembles, consisting of multiple ML models voting on predictions, have been found to be an effective resilience technique. Ensembles are resilient when their constituent models behave independently during inference, by focusing on different features in an input. However, independence is not observed on every input, resulting in mispredictions. One way to improve ensemble resilience is to dynamically weigh predictions during inference by its constituent models instead of treating each model equally. While previous work on dynamically weighted models in ensembles has relied upon output diversity metrics due to efficiency, we focus on the feature-space of inputs for accuracy. Hence, we propose the use of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) techniques to dynamically adjust the weight of ensemble models based on local feature-space diversity.","2833-292X","979-8-3503-9570-9","10.1109/DSN-S60304.2024.00018","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10647092","Error resilience;Machine learning;Explainability","Measurement;Crowdsourcing;Accuracy;Explainable AI;Training data;Focusing;Medical services","","","","26","IEEE","29 Aug 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Furthermore, the availability of physical information about drainage systems is progressively increasing (more than 50% of the Spanish town and cities developed Urban Drainage Master Plans, more than 75% in case of big cities) offering the possibility to bridge the gap between river and pluvial flood modelling with special focus on complex systems where ephemeral water courses drain into channelled pipes connected to sewers or drain into main roads and avenues. In order to achieve a reliable and comprehensive flood risk assessment, cutting-edge 1D/2D coupled flood models are essential with the possibility to use social media crowdsourcing data during the phases of set up, calibration and validation. These models should take into account flow transferring between 1D and 2D layers through a proper characterization of surface drainage elements. 1D/2D calibrated and validated models allow to achieve realistic hazard assessment and hazard maps based on tailored hazard criteria related to risk receptor. Possible use of coupled models also allows to feed impacts models and perform comprehensive risk assessment including direct and indirect damages, as such as cascading effects.

These systems usually collect a large data stream of images coming from different heterogeneous sources (e.g, IoT devices and humans) in an inadvertent way. Due to the limitations and challenges related to communication bandwidth, storage, and processing capabilities, it is unwise to transfer unselectively all the photos since most of them often either contain duplicate information, are inaccurate, or are just falsely submitted. In this paper, we propose to design a smart image selection procedure using an asymmetric multi-modal neural network autoencoder to select a subset of photos that has high utility coverage for multiple incoming streams. The proposed system enables selecting high context data from an evolving picture stream and ensures relevance. The approach uses the photo's metadata such as geo-location and timestamps along with the pictures' semantics to decide which photos can be submitted and which ones must be discarded. Simulation results for two different multi-modal autoencoder architectures indicate that a mixed asymmetric stacked autoencoder approach can yield better results outperforming the concatenated input autoencoder while leveraging user-side rendering to reduce bandwidth consumption and computational overhead.","","978-1-6654-5073-7","10.1109/APCCAS55924.2022.10090330","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10090330","Autoencoders;image processing;deep learning;mobile crowdsourcing;smart city","Crowdsourcing;Simulation;Neural networks;Urban areas;Semantics;Bandwidth;Streaming media","","","","16","IEEE","11 Apr 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This study investigates the feasibility of PUVs as potential wardriving vehicles for opportunistic coverage mapping. This method is cost-efficient and removes the problem of data recency because of its continuous daily trips. The findings suggest that opportunistic wardriving with PUVs is viable for wardriving with its capability to detect a high volume of access points (APs). Multiple runs within the University of the Philippines Diliman campus showed the PUVs’ effectiveness in detecting a significant number of APs, with higher success rates at closer distances. Comparatively, warwalking detected fewer APs, but there was a significant overlap between the methods. The study also highlighted significant differences in detected AP types, with wardriving finding more mobile hotspots and miscellaneous devices than warwalking. Overall, the results underline the effectiveness of PUVs in providing extensive WiFi coverage data and further enhancements to the detection system could optimize the approach.","2832-1383","979-8-3315-2121-9","10.1109/IoTaIS64014.2024.10799253","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10799253","access points;wardriving;warwalking;geolocation;public utility vehicles","Accuracy;Limiting;Refining;Interference;WiMAX;Hardware;Object recognition;Printers;Transient analysis;Wireless fidelity","","","","18","IEEE","19 Dec 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The key for TOA technique is the signal propagation should be straight geometrically. However, when the train runs in harsh environments, the GNSS signal quality can be degraded due to obstacles. GNSS signals are usually blocked by buildings and other obstacles, resulting in reflection and reflection, which leads to multipath positioning errors of LOS and NLOS. In the case of LOS multipath error, the GNSS receiver tracks the direct and reflected / diffracted composite signal, and the reflected / diffracted signal affects the correlation function tracking loop of the direct signal in GNSS. In the case of NLOS multipath error, GNSS receiver directly tracks reflected or diffracted signal because there is no direct satellite signal. In both cases, the multipath signal will have a large noise error range which is reflected in the change of SNR. In the GNSS solution, various GNSS receivers are used to obtain the SNR of each satellite to achieve the fully coverage of the satellite signal reception quality. Thus with limited GNSS receiver observation results, of the crowdsourcing of NLOS signal inspection will deliver the observation results in a more convenient way. In the open environment scenario, the relationship between elevation angle and SNR can be fitted by a linear function. However, in GNSS signal reception degraded environments (urban canyon etc.), The SNR at the elevation angle of the occlusion boundary will be drastically reduced. This will give us the boundary of the occlusion range. Based on this principle, we can map the environmental characteristics of different sections of the railway. The railway environment can generally be divided into open scenario, road cutting scenario, half sky scenario, urban canyon scenario and tunnel scenario. 5 typical scenario all have distinct environmental characteristics. By matching the segment with the typical environmental characteristics, the scenario situation of the segment is determined, and then the accuracy of satellite positioning is given.","","978-1-6654-1386-2","10.1109/ICEAA52647.2021.9539795","Research and Development; National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9539795","railway;scenario;environment characteristics;SNR;Crowdsourced","Crowdsourcing;Antenna measurements;Global navigation satellite system;Tracking loops;Satellites;Receivers;Reflection","","","","6","IEEE","21 Sep 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To solve these challenges, this paper proposes a developer recommendation algorithm based on multi-relationship knowledge enhancement. We identify entities and contextual entities from text features and link the relationship between tasks and developers from a knowledge perspective.

It is realized by effectively incorporating a front-end of speech chunking prior to the main transcription task. The front-end is intended to increase the flexibility of the transcription task allocation to participants and more importantly to reduce the burden of the task itself by chopping audio data in advance into appropriate length of utterances and accordingly easing the repetitive playback operations. As an initial study, the performance of the speech chunking is investigated for various types of contents on how appropriately speech chunks are extracted as a transcription task unit.

However, despite the clear advantages provided by obfuscation most apps do not use it, often because of the difficulties induced by the usage of obfuscation which requires writing rules to keep a usable app. In this paper, we identify the concrete challenges encountered by app developers who wish to use obfuscation in their apps. In addition, we propose an approach using crowdsourcing to automatically generate rules, when static analysis is not sufficient. With the knowledge gained from hundreds of projects, we hope to lighten the burden on developers when writing rules.","","978-1-4503-7959-5","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10187602","mobile apps;android;obfuscation;proguard;crowdsourcing;machine learning","Crowdsourcing;Ecosystems;Static analysis;Intellectual property;Writing;Software;Mobile applications","","","","14","","25 Jul 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Given that speech content typically varies with the speaker's age during conversations, it's plausible that age estimation results could be influenced by speech content. To address this concern, we developed a dataset in which speakers of different ages delivered speech content that was consistent across all speakers and tailored to the characteristics of each age group. We estimated the speakers' ages both manually, through crowdsourcing, and automatically and then conducted a significance test to assess whether speech content affected the age estimation results. Our findings indicated that neither the automatic age estimation system employed nor the manual age estimation outcomes were significantly impacted by speech content.","2076-1465","978-9-4645-9360-0","10.23919/EUSIPCO58844.2023.10290106","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10290106","Statistical hypothesis testing;crowdsourcing;age estimation;speaker attribute estimation","Crowdsourcing;Vocabulary;Estimation;Europe;Manuals;Oral communication;Signal processing","","","","18","","1 Nov 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Majority of the state-of-the-art opinion aggregation problems deal with the independent opinions of the crowd workers. In these cases, quality enhancement of the aggregation of their opinions is a major issue. In our preliminary work, we propose different opinion aggregation models that consider independent crowd opinions having binary or multiple options. Recently, different emerging real-life problems demand to aggregate crowd opinions where there is a provision of observing others' opinions before providing someone's own opinions. This unfolds a new opinion aggregation problem, namely dependent opinion aggregation. My research focus is on finding better crowd opinion aggregation models to deal with those independent and dependent crowd opinions. Moreover, we introduce another new paradigm of opinion aggregation that deals with the constrained opinions of the crowd workers. Most of the traditional crowd opinion aggregation models fail to derive final decision from constrained crowd opinions. In the current research, we propose different novel variants of opinion aggregation models while the opinions are collected from the crowd.","","978-1-7281-1488-0","10.1109/AIKE.2019.00056","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8791717","Ensemble, Crowdsourcing, Constrained Opinions","Planning;Probabilistic logic;Crowdsourcing;Task analysis;Decision making;Smart cities;Graphical models","","","","27","EU","8 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Whereas standard tests for assessing perceived quality make use of native listeners, we assume that noise-reduced speech and residual noise may affect native and non-native listeners of a target language in different ways. To test this assumption, we report results of two subjective tests conducted with English and German native listeners who judge the quality of speech samples recorded by native English, German, and Mandarin speakers, which are degraded with different background noise levels and noise suppression effects. The experiments were conducted following the standardized ITU-T Rec. P.835 approach, however implemented in a crowdsourcing setting according to ITU-T Rec. P.808.

Such applications share similar characteristics as they need to 1) detect specific objects or events (what), 2) associate the detected object with a location (where), and 3) know the time that the event happened (when). Advancements in image-based machine learning (ML) benefit these applications as they can automate the detection of objects of interest. Along with the edge computing (EC) paradigm, the processing cost is offloaded to the devices, hence reducing latency and communication cost. Moreover, sensors on the edge devices (e.g., GPS) enrich the collected data with metadata. However, a shortcoming of existing approaches is that they rely on pre-trained ""static"" models. Nonetheless, crowdsourced data at diverse locations can be leveraged to iteratively improve the robustness of a model. We refer to the aforementioned strategy as ""spatial crowd-based learning"".To showcase this class of applications, we present FloraVision, an end-to-end system that integrates ML, crowdsourcing, and EC to automate the detection, mapping, and exploration of California Native Plants. FloraVision implements a pipeline to collect and clean publicly available image data, train a lightweight MobileNet-based classification model, and then deploy the model on mobile devices.

"Investigating Gender on a Scale of Masculine/Feminine Appearance","M. Wen; M.

This paper describes the development of the Facial Androgyny Measure & Estimation (FAME) models that treat gender appearance on a continuous scale. FAME comprises two models: one uses a non-human approach, which uses logistic regression trained on binary labels and uses the probability output as the measure for how male or female a face is, and the other model uses a human approach, based on learning continuous human labels of the perceived level of”femininity/masculinity”. To gather human labels, a crowdsourcing platform was used to obtain 5500 total human labels of 1100 faces using a 7-level masculinity/femininity scale. Linear regression was then trained with 10-fold cross validation with L1 regression on the 68 facial landmarks extracted from the images. By developing and comparing the FAME models, we gain insight on the characteristics that may be associated more with one gender. Logistic regression weights found that a shorter and wider nose may be more male, and linear regression weights found that features such as low eyebrows, thinner lips, and wider jaws may be characteristic of increasing maleness.","","978-1-7281-5818-1","10.1109/URTC49097.2019.9660606","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9660606","gender;facial androgyny;logistic regression;linear regression","Crowdsourcing;Lips;Conferences;Linear regression;Nose;Estimation;Feature extraction","","","","7","IEEE","4 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It has made commuting much easier and faster. With the increase in population, there has been a massive surge in the number of passengers leading to crowding at platforms and bus stops. Since the frequency of buses and rapid transit is uneven and lacks proper real-time tracking of buses, we see a vast discrepancy in the number of passengers traveling. Such discrepancies not only have a vast economic impact but also make travelling by buses difficult for regular commuters, also increasing the travelling time. Especially considering the COVID 19 situation, it can cause a lot of problems. Thus, there is a need for a system that can adjust itself according to the number of passengers and real-time tracking of public transportation systems available for passengers.With this paper, we aim towards providing an intelligent transportation system using real-time data to manage the frequency of mass transit systems by crowdsourcing people on bus stands in real-time using CCTV, analyzing the data, and making decisions realtime on the frequency of these mass transit systems by analyzing data through the help of data science and machine learning which would help in automation of rapid transit systems.","","978-1-6654-2503-2","10.1109/SMARTGENCON51891.2021.9645799","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9645799","Crowd-sensing;Computer Vision;COVID-19 pandemic;Public Transport;Machine Learning;CNN","Urban areas;Sociology;Machine learning;Real-time systems;Sensors;Surges;Statistics","","","","14","IEEE","21 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To address these issues, a privacy-preserving location data collection method under local differential privacy based on spatial data federation is proposed. Firstly, the road network space is segmented using Voronoi diagrams, and a random perturbation approach is employed to perturb the location data within each Voronoi cell. Subsequently, a method for conducting spatial range queries on perturbed datasets is designed to obtain unbiased estimates of the true results. Finally, experiments are conducted to validate the proposed method, demonstrating its effectiveness in terms of data availability, algorithm efficiency, and scalability.","","979-8-3503-8697-4","10.1109/IoTAAI62601.2024.10692511","Research and Development; Technology Development; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10692511","Data federation;spatial data;differential privacy","Crowdsourcing;Differential privacy;Scalability;Roads;Perturbation methods;Data collection;Market research;Spatial databases;Servers;Internet of Things","","","","6","IEEE","2 Oct 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Because most football clubs are not wealthy enough to buy expensive high-quality players, the football clubs should rely on good and proper player composition and formation instead to survive in the highest competition. In academic research, constructing optimum team formation for football is a challenging task, so in this study, we propose a systematic literature review to answer some research questions. The first research question regards the contribution of academic research on the Smart Football topic with the result finding of dominated contribution on Football's Team Formation topic, despite some of them still using spatiotemporal analysis. The second research question discusses methods available for team formation problems, and it can be concluded that most of them have also contributed to real football's team formation problems. Nevertheless, some of the dominant methods such as Social Network Graph, Genetic Algorithm, and Mathematical Formula Model needs more attention to be implemented in real football's team formation problem. The last research question aims to observe in which implementation domain area those team formation's algorithms mostly applied. The resulting finding is that software engineering, crowdsourcing tasks, the social media network, and team-expert tasks are the most dominant domain areas applied to team formation problems, so in the future, we can consider those domain areas to be contributed to constructing real football team formation.","","979-8-3503-3954-3","10.1109/ICISS59129.2023.10291603","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10291603","Systematic Literature Review;Smart Football;Team Formation Methods;Implementation Domain Area","Crowdsourcing;Systematics;Social networking (online);Bibliographies;Mathematical models;Spatiotemporal phenomena;Task analysis","","","","64","IEEE","27 Oct 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In our experiment, we used an online database which consists of colors that more than 200,000 users have named. Based on the amount of unique names that users have given each color, an entropy value was calculated to represent the uncertainty level of the color. A model, which performed better than chance, was created to predict whether or not the color that the participant was describing was ambiguous or borderline, given certain prosodic cues of their speech when asked to name the color verbally. Using crowdsourced data can greatly streamline the process of annotating uncertainty, but our methods have yet to be tested in other domains besides color. By using methods such as ours to measure prosodic attributes of uncertainty, it should be possible to increase the accuracy of voice search.","","978-1-4799-7129-9","10.1109/SLT.2014.7078556","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7078556","uncertainty;speech analysis;color;annotation;crowdsourcing","Uncertainty;Image color analysis;Entropy;Color;Speech;Accuracy;Measurement uncertainty","","","","11","IEEE","2 Apr 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Using their estimated LoA, agents may then voluntarily restrain themselves to participate to the activity of the multi-agent system, without being banned by some central control authority. For that purpose, agents, when they meet, perform pairwise comparison tests (PCT) able to determine which is the best agent of a pair of competing agents. Two maximum \emph{a posteriori} (MAP) estimators of the LoA of each agent are proposed using the results of several PCTs. These MAP estimators are then employed to determine, for a given agent, the LoA of the next opponent that minimizes its probability of LoA estimation error. Simulations results show that the proposed optimal opponent selection approach provides better results than simply choosing opponents at random, or always choosing the opponents with the best LoA.","2576-6813","978-1-5386-4727-1","10.1109/GLOCOM.2018.8648103","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8648103","","Estimation error;Sensors;Task analysis;Random variables;Multi-agent systems;Crowdsourcing;Simulation","","","","26","IEEE","21 Feb 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Labeling the fingerprints of passive crowdsourcing can effectively alleviate the work pressure of radio map construction while maintaining high location estimation accuracy. Although Naive Bayes method shows stable classification ability in presence of less correlated and missing data, which are the characters of RSSI data in WiFi positioning, the frequency histogram based native Bayes methods show poor performance in estimating conditional probability when the interval setting of discretization is not appropriate. So, we use KDE to calculate the conditional probability of naive Bayes instead of frequency histogram. Consider that the fingerprints to be labeled can provide valuable information, we further propose the transductive semi-supervised method where the fingerprints to be labeled assist in the learning process. The RMSE of experimental data is 2.418m, more accurate than other benchmark algorithms, proving the validity and efficiency of the proposed algorithm for labeling crowdsourced heterogeneous fingerprints.","2475-7896","978-1-7281-2311-0","10.1109/ICCAIS46528.2019.9074649","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9074649","indoor localization;WiFi;naive Bayes;kernel probability density estimation;semi-supervised","Histograms;Kernel;Estimation;Bayes methods;Crowdsourcing;Wireless fidelity","","","","15","IEEE","23 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A common measurement methodology is an application on the customers' phones which injects probe packets into the network under test and derives estimates for selected network properties such as available bandwidth. Bandwidth measurements in cellular wireless networks, which are highly dynamic and offer only shared resources, are in general a resource demanding task. Current methods deploy tests of constant duration running data transfers over TCP. Their resource consumption scales directly with the available capacity of the link. In this work we take a closer look at the different chosen test durations and analyze the trade-off between accuracy and resources spent in various different configurations, e.g., numbers of parallel TCP connections, based on extensive measurements in real world operational LTE and UMTS networks conducted in 2016, Austria.

The aim of this study is to measure selected cognitive ability (general reasoning skill) of crowdsourced workers, and investigate the effect that this characteristic has upon judgment reliability, as measured against a human gold standard. A significant correlation was found between judgment reliability and measured general reasoning skill.

However, it can be vulnerable to environmental change if Wi-Fi fingerprint-based localization system uses fixed Wi-Fi fingerprint database as training dataset and has no method for updating training dataset. In this paper, we propose AR-WFL system including update phase that can reflect environmental change periodically and prevent performance degradation. The proposed AR-WFL system is based on crowdsourcing and no dedicated annotator exists. In addition, we adopt active learning scheme with uncertainty selective sampling algorithm to maximize cost-efficiency of the update phase. We evaluate the performance of the update phase as location estimation accuracy using a dataset we collected for 2 months. It shows that average accuracy is increased by 1.83%p using update phase with uncertainty sampling algorithm compared with the system without an update phase.","","979-11-88428-01-4","10.23919/ICACT.2018.8323933","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8323933","Indoor localization;Wi-Fi fingerprint;Active learning;Selective sampling;Database update","Wireless fidelity;Location awareness;Fingerprint recognition;Information security;Uncertainty;Training;Telecommunications","","","","","","26 Mar 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Such an approach decentralizes the computation and allows elastic camera deployment without upgrading the centralized server. Nevertheless, taking human detection as an example, cameras at different locations could have very different numbers of people walking by at different times. This condition could make specific cameras run their detection tasks at the highest frame per second (FPS) but still lose information if FPS is lower than a certain value, while a small group of cameras has almost zero tasks, thus wasting valuable computation power. In addition, as the smart surveillance system grows, cameras deployed at different periods could have different specifications and computation capabilities; therefore, properly utilizing all the computation resources has become essential for smart surveillance systems. The aforementioned observations motivate this study to propose a novel computation souring method by following the concept of crowdsourcing to enable efficient resource sharing within smart surveillance systems and maximize the amount of retrieved information. Promising results have been demonstrated through a series of experiments with different smart cameras of different specifications.","2768-4156","979-8-3503-9838-0","10.1109/ICASI57738.2023.10179554","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10179554","human detection;resource sharing;sourcing;surveillance;camera","Legged locomotion;Technological innovation;Surveillance;Smart cameras;Cameras;Information retrieval;Object recognition","","","","10","IEEE","19 Jul 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In order to alleviate these issues, we propose to use the BubbleView metaphor as a way of crowdsourcing visual attention data on 3D graphical content. In this paper, we question the adequacy of this method to provide a reliable proxy for visual attention in the context of 3D graphical objects.

The methodological crisis of historical science, which has lasted for several decades, has recently been replaced by an explosion of interest in historical memory, intellectual history, and microhistory. The development of social media and the spread of crowdsourcing technologies have made it possible for a large number of Internet users to participate in historical research. Today, not only professional historians are the creators of historical content that forms historical memory, but also opinion leaders who use historical knowledge to influence the society. A historian begins to serve as the creator of communication links between academic historical science and the audience consuming historical content. Today, a historian is not only a researcher incorporated in the social networks of professional communities, but also a popularizer of historical knowledge, building communication in the digital environment. Digital society as a new social order and system of knowledge production not only provides convenient tools of knowledge, but also changes knowledge itself, the latter becomes digital and reflects digital modernity. Comprehending history in these conditions inevitably leads to the emergence of digital history. Thanks to the Internet, the Humanities have been enriched with new methods of knowledge, which has caused the development of various areas of digital Humanities, including digital history. Digital history involves not only the use of information and computer technologies in the study of the past, but also the history of digital society. We conclude that digital history has become a scientific discipline that creates a theory of digital society and changes the models of professional communication of history researchers.","","978-1-7281-6441-0","10.1109/ComSDS49898.2020.9101312","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9101312","digital history;digital humanities;digital society;media competence;digital media;digital historical memory;professional communication;digital communication","History;Media;Social network services;Internet;Training;Cultural differences","","","","14","IEEE","27 May 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
