Such data embeds rich and significant knowledge about software projects, their quality and services, as well as the dynamics of software development. Most often, this data is not organized, stored, and presented in a way that is immediately useful to software developers and project managers to support their decisions. To help developers and managers understand their projects, how they evolve, as well as support them during their decision-making process, software analytics -- use of analysis, data, and systematic reasoning for making decisions -- has become an emerging field of modern data analysis. While results obtained from analytics-based solutions suggested so far are promising, there are still several challenges associated with the adoption of software analytics into software development processes, as well as the development and integration of analytics tools in practical settings. We therefore propose a tutorial on software analytics. The tutorial will start with an introduction of software analytics. Next, we will discuss the main challenges and opportunities associated with software analytics based on the examples from our own research. These examples will cover a range of topics leveraging software analytics. The topics include mobile apps quality, code review process and its quality, analytics for the software engineering Twitter space, as well as the use of analytics to solve scheduling problems in the cloud.","","978-1-4503-4205-6","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7883436","Software Analytics;Challenges;Opportunities","Software;Software engineering;Tutorials;Data mining;Mobile communication;Twitter;Conferences","","3","","","","23 Mar 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The tensor-shape error is critical in the deep neural net code; much of the training cost and intermediate results are to be lost once a tensor shape mismatch occurs in the midst of the training phase. Given the input PyTorch source, PyTea statically traces every possible execution path, collects tensor shape constraints required by the tensor operation sequence of the path, and decides if the constraints are unsatisfiable (hence a shape error can occur). PyTea’s scalability and precision hinges on the characteristics of real-world PyTorch applications: the number of execution paths after PyTea’s conservative pruning rarely explodes and loops are simple enough to be circumscribed by our symbolic abstraction. We tested PyTea against the projects in the official PyTorch repository and some tensor-error code questioned in the StackOverflow.

Various attempts have been made to make such a common platform, Quora and StackOverflow are two major players in this domain. Query fuel-an interactive community platform that aims to provide a similar solution with some features better than the existing solutions. The platform works on an organizational basis, where a registered user can post a query or any topic of discussion and let others participate. The organization and topic can vary from being a college to a support group where people feel safe discussing their discrete issues. Built on the MERN stack and having a custom ‘Query Searching Algorithm,’ the web application takes in the query as text input and passes through a search engine where we use the Probabilistic Ranking Algorithm and log-Linear Model Ranking Algorithm, which sets criterions for each query and rank them. This minimizes each query’s search time and enables the ‘Search as Type’ feature, which is not present in the existing systems. After thorough testing, we have come up with several metrics which prove that our solution is much more secure compared to the existing ones. Once we test the scalability with data in millions, we will be ready to ship this to the commercial market.","","979-8-3503-3600-9","10.1109/ICNWC57852.2023.10127556","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10127556","Query Searching;Time Complexity;Penetration Testing;Security;MERN Stack","Measurement;Scalability;Organizations;Search engines;Back;Probabilistic logic;Registers","","1","","15","IEEE","25 May 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper proposes a deep learning approach for predicting the semantic similarity of question pairs to address the issue of duplicate questions. The proposed model employs a Siamese network-based Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architecture, utilizing word embedding vectors from various algorithms such as Glo Ve, Word2Vec, and FastText. Previous research on duplicate question identification is reviewed, with our approach overcoming drawbacks such as low-level semantic connections and text type incompatibility. After pre-processing the Siamese LSTM network compares the embeddings using L1 distance to determine question pair similarity.

The perceptions of developers about an API, and the choices they make about whether and how they should use it, may, to a considerable degree, be conditioned upon how other developers see and evaluate the API. Given the plethora of APIs available for a given development task and the advent of developer forums as the media to share opinions about those APIs, it can be challenging for a developer to make informed decisions about an API to support the task. We introduce Opiner, our opinion search and summarization engine for API reviews. The server side of Opiner collects and summarizes opinions about APIs by crawling online developer forums and by associating the opinions found in the forum posts to the APIs discussed in the posts. The client side of Opiner is a Website that presents different summarized viewpoints of the opinions about the APIs in an online search engine. We evaluated Opiner by asking Industrial developers to select APIs for two development tasks.

In this paper, we propose a novel code search tool-RACK-that returns relevant source code for a given code search query written in natural language text. The tool first translates the query into a list of relevant API classes by mining keyword-API associations from the crowdsourced knowledge of Stack Overflow, and then applies the reformulated query to GitHub code search API for collecting relevant results. Once a query related to a programming task is submitted, the tool automatically mines relevant code snippets from thousands of open-source projects, and displays them as a ranked list within the context of the developer's programming environment-the IDE.

This paper presents an empirical study aimed at verifying this assumption and discusses the impact of the common vocabulary on duplicate issue detection. The study investigated 13K+ pairs of duplicate bug reports and Stack Overflow (SO) questions. We found that on average, more than 12.2% of the duplicate pairs do not have common terms. The other duplicate issue descriptions share, on average, 30% of their vocabulary. The good news is that these duplicates have significantly more terms in common than the non-duplicates.

However, the model suffers from severe security threats. Specifically, a centralized network controller is a precious target for two reasons. First, the controller is located at a central point between the application and data planes. Second, a controller is software which prone to vulnerabilities, e.g., buffer and stack overflow. Hence, providing security measures is a crucial procedure towards the fully unleash of the new model capabilities. Intrusion detection is an option to enhance the networking security. Several approaches were proposed, for instance, signature-based, and anomaly detection. Anomaly detection is a broad approach deployed by various methods, e.g., machine learning.

Utilizing dataset of stack overflow questions, answers, and tags as information, we find that standard machine learning systems completely beat human-delivered baselines. These majorly include Naive Bayes Classifier for multinomial models, Linear Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression, Word to vector (Word2vec) and Logistic Regression, Document to vector (Doc2vc) and logistic regression, Bag of Words (BOW) with Keras. Our paper is a detailed examination and comparison of accuracies among these algorithms.","","978-1-6654-3897-1","10.1109/ICECCE52056.2021.9514108","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9514108","Text classification;stack overflow;Machine learning;supervised machine learning;classifiers;Linear Support Vector Machine;Logistic Regression;Word2vec and Logistic Regression;Doc2vc and logistic regression;BOW with Keras","Machine learning algorithms;Text categorization;Support vector machine classification;Machine learning;Naive Bayes methods;Classification algorithms;Standards","","4","","26","IEEE","27 Aug 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Several Software Development Methodologies exist for the successful delivery of software. These methodologies are categorized into Traditional and Agile Methods that further include Waterfall, iterative, spiral, evolutionary, eXtreme, Scrum, Kanban, RAD and many more models under them. Existence of many development models raises the need for appropriate selection of models or methodology to deliver successful software. The underlying review considers Waterfall, Iterative, RAD, Scrum models followed by DevOps culture for software development. Their tabular comparative assessment and graphical review based on recent Google and Stack Overflow Trends is performed that accelerates the development trend towards DevOps based Software Engineering (DOSE). DevOps employs alternative automation tools at different stages of software development to achieve the target of success along with quality software delivery. Though traditional models follow old strategies of software development but based on renowned researchers survey work and the popularity of these models in software industries makes them a part of this quality survey and assessment. By virtue of this quality survey, researchers/students and software developers will find it easy to understand the modus operandi of development methodologies. It will also help these target audiences to decide at ease about appropriate and efficient model selection for software development. Other models under these development methods or DevOps can also be considered and compared as a part of future/further research.","","978-1-6654-5883-2","10.1109/DELCON54057.2022.9753613","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9753613","Agile;DevOps;Software Development;Traditional Models","Industries;Spirals;IEEE Sections;Organizations;Market research;Software;Internet","","4","","30","IEEE","20 Apr 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The wireless sensor node consists of 8 bit micro controller and limited memory for the storage. The scalar multiplication process can be accelerated with the sliding window method which has two stages namely pre computation and an evaluation stage. Points for use in the evaluation stage are computed in the pre computation stage. The scalar multiplication is carried out in the evaluation stage with the addition of pre computed points. The number of pre computations depends on the window size of sliding window method. More is the window size, more are the pre computations and more is the memory required for the storage. This is the well-known draw-back of the sliding window method when implemented on WSN Nodes. This research paper proposes sliding window method with flexible window size for scalar multiplication on wireless sensor nodes. The flexible window size will prevent sensor node failures due to stack overflow.","","978-1-4244-5136-4","10.1109/ICWCSC.2010.5415874","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5415874","Point multiplication;wireless sensor nodes;window size;ECC;precomputation;stack depth analysis;base segment;data segment","Wireless sensor networks;Elliptic curve cryptography;Elliptic curves;Error correction codes;Acceleration;Communication system security;Data analysis;Arithmetic;Data security;Read-write memory","","3","","7","IEEE","17 Feb 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For instance, many public available biometric APIs do not provide sufficient instructions / precise documentations on the usage of biometric APIs. Many developers are struggling in implementing these APIs in various tasks. Moreover, quick update on biometric-based algorithms (e.g. feature extraction and matching) may propagate to APIs, which leads to potential confusion to the system developers. Hence, we conduct an empirical study to the problems that the developers currently encountered while implementing the biometric APIs as well as the issues that need to be addressed when developing biometric systems using these APIs. We manually analyzed a total of 500 biometric API-related posts from various online media such as Stack Overflow and Neurotechnology. We reveal that 1) most of the problems encountered are related to the lack of precise documentation on the biometric APIs; 2) the incompatibility of biometric APIs cross multiple implementation environments.","2576-3148","978-1-7281-3094-1","10.1109/ICSME.2019.00053","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8919006","Biometrics;APIs misuse;Empirical software engineering","Documentation;Neurotechnology;Task analysis;Software;Face;Market research;Sorting","","3","","14","IEEE","5 Dec 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, this static allocation is not appropriate for memory constrained sensor hardware because shortage of stack memory space can bring in the stack overflow problem. As an alternative method, this paper proposes a dynamic stack allocating method, which enables to adaptively adjust the stack size of each threads based on the stack usage information. The information of the stack usage is obtained by measurement at run-time. The proposed method also defines a stack reallocating problem and solves it in n steps, where n is the number of thread stacks.

This paper aims to support developers in detecting insecure SSL/TLS implementation in their codes by utilizing a low-cost cross-language static analysis tool called PMD. In the end, two insecure implementations of SSL/TLS have been identified, and subsequently a new PMD rule set is created. This rule set consists of three rules for addressing hostname validation vulnerability and certificate validation vulnerability. The rules have been evaluated over 1,517 code snippets obtained from Stack Overflow, and the results show that 71% of the code snippets contain insecure SSL/TLS patterns.

"Keynote: Event Driven Software Quality","J. Palsberg","University of California, Los Angeles, USA",2009 International Conference on Embedded Software and Systems,"5 Jun 2009","2009","","","xxi","xxi","Summary form only given. Event-driven programming has found pervasive acceptance, from high-performance servers to embedded systems, as an efficient method for interacting with a complex world. The fastest research Web servers are event- driven, as is the most common operating system for sensor nodes. An event-driven program handles concurrent logical tasks using a cooperative, application-level scheduler. The application developer separates each logical task into event handlers; the scheduler runs multiple handlers in an interleaved fashion. Unfortunately, the loose coupling of the event handlers obscures the program's control flow and makes dependencies hard to express and detect, leading to subtle bugs. As a result, event-driven programs can be difficult to understand, making them hard to debug, maintain, extend, and validate. This talk presents recent approaches to event-driven software quality based on static analysis and testing, along with some open problems. We will discuss progress on how to avoid buffer overflow in TCP servers, stack overflow and missed deadlines in microcontrollers, and rapid battery drain in sensor networks. Our work is part of the Event Driven Software Quality project at UCLA, which is aimed at building the next generation of language and tool support for event-driven programming.","","978-1-4244-4359-8","10.1109/ICESS.2009.98","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5066621","","Software quality;Embedded system;Web server;Operating systems;Sensor systems;Event detection;Computer bugs;Software testing;Buffer overflow;Network servers","","1","","","IEEE","5 Jun 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As we enter 2015, with continued concerns that mega-crises may become the new normal, we need to develop novel methods to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of our management of disasters. Software engineering as a discipline has long had an impact on society beyond its role in the development of software systems. In fact, software engineers have been described as the developers of prototypes for future knowledge workers; tools such as Github and Stack Overflow have demonstrated applications beyond the domain of software engineering. In this paper, we take the potential influence of software engineering one-step further and propose using the software service engineering paradigm as a new approach to managing disasters. Specifically, we show how the underlying principles of service-oriented architectures (SOA) can be applied to the coordination of disaster response operations.

Despite existing example code on the web, on sites like Stack Overflow, cryptographic Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) are commonly misused. There is little known about what makes examples helpful for developers in using crypto APIs. Analogical problem solving is a psychological theory that investigates how people use known solutions to solve new problems. There is evidence that the capacity to reason and solve novel problems a.k.a Fluid Intelligence (Gf) and structurally and procedurally similar solutions support problem solving. Aim: Our goal is to understand whether similarity and Gf also have an effect in the context of using cryptographic APIs with the help of code examples. Method : We conducted a controlled experiment with 76 student participants developing with or without procedurally similar examples, one of two Java crypto libraries and measured the Gf of the participants as well as the effect on usability (effectiveness, efficiency, satisfaction) and security bugs. Results: We observed a strong effect of code examples with a high procedural similarity on all dependent variables. Fluid intelligence Gf had no effect. It also made no difference which library the participants used. Conclusions: Example code must be more highly similar to a concrete solution, not very abstract and generic to have a positive effect in a development task.","2574-1926","978-1-4503-7122-3","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9270368","Example Code;Intelligence;security;usability","Cryptography;Libraries;Task analysis;Computer bugs;Usability;Software engineering;Particle measurements","","","","7","","1 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This technology is just one innovation along a long arc of disruptions in software engineering that include the internet, high-level programming languages, integrated development environments, open source, agile development, and social coding environments. Disruptive technologies such as these show the potential to augment and accelerate development activities along many socio-technical dimensions, while altering fundamental business processes and paradigms. Yet paradoxically, these innovations have the potential to eventually undermine the very advancements they seek to promote, rendering technologies and methods obsolete [1].When any new disruptive technology emerges, successful software companies that traditionally respond well to incremental innovations often fail when they suffer from inertia to change or don’t anticipate how people will interact with the new technology. Similarly, researchers constrained by rigid research discipline can be slow to react, and may fail to recognize important and urgent societal and industrial needs. Researchers and companies alike may struggle in knowing which metrics to use and even how to measure the impact of change, further misleading their efforts to adapt.In this talk, I question the way we select research questions in software engineering and how we study them, particularly in the face of innovations such as generative AI. To provoke a change in our research, I introduce a disruptive playbook to steer us towards broader and more novel research directions. This step-by-step playbook is first illustrated by applying it to a prior disruptive technology, Stack Overflow. I will discuss how the playbook provides a new lens for reflecting on this body of research and how doing so reveals new insights. I then use the playbook, assisted with a customized research playbook GPT, to brainstorm and frame new research directions about the emerging disruptive innovations in software engineering that are being built on top of generative AI.","2574-3864","979-8-4007-0587-8","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10555819","Software Engineering;Disruptive Innovations;Playbook;Research Questions","Technological innovation;Generative AI;Companies;Rendering (computer graphics);Software;Software measurement;Disruptive technologies","","","","2","","18 Jun 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this work, we categorize some bugs that could occur when implementing quantum circuits. This poster is part of a bigger work that aims to assist developers in debugging their circuits. This is done by bridging some testing and debugging techniques from the classical world, such as hypothesis and binary-like testing, and debugging-assistance functions, such as tracking gates and detecting qubits' light cones.

In this paper, an off-chip model is proposed to detect violated memory accesses at run-time without incurring hardware cost. It can efficiently detect errors for RTOS-based applications in cases of stack overflow, reading/writing to code/data segments of the other tasks or violated memory access to OS kernel. The hardware component based on FPGA is also built by hooking on memory system bus to monitor memory accesses. Once error detection phase is completed, the hardware prototype can be detached from the system. Some testbeds are used for this model and give good results.","","978-1-4244-7101-0","10.1109/MESA.2010.5552065","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5552065","component;MMU;MPU;FPGA;RTOS;SoC;TLB;PLB;MCU","Switches;Kernel","","","","25","IEEE","19 Aug 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

From a business context, paraphrase identification is significantly helpful to improve the user experience of the platform. It is an active research area by companies like Quora, Stack Overflow, and other question-answering websites. One of the main issues that these companies face is the problem of repeating questions. If one is successfully able to capture and interpret the semantics of the sentence and the intent of the user, this would improve the consumer experience. Quora’s official dataset was used in the present research work. To find a question that was similar, we modeled the dataset of Quora question pairs. It was a Binary classification task and various approaches were explored and experimented with. Bag of Words was used for feature extraction. A traditional machine learning approach was followed and algorithms like XGBoost, RF, and decision tree were used. These models were evaluated based on their F-1 and accuracy scores. Feature engineering was performed that significantly improved the model accuracy. The decision tree model was able to achieve an accuracy of up to 78.8% while Random Forest and XGBoost had an accuracy of 76.2% and 75.4%.","","979-8-3503-3577-4","10.1109/InC457730.2023.10262888","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10262888","Paraphrase;semantics;TF-IDF;Information Retrieval;meta-heuristics;corpus","Radio frequency;Industries;Machine learning algorithms;Computational modeling;Semantics;Companies;User experience","","","","14","IEEE","29 Sep 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In the current context, engineers continue to spend substantial time and effort on resolving errors once anomalous logs have been detected. To achieve truly automated software system management and highlevel Artificial Intelligence for IT Operations (AIOps), it's necessary to bridge the gap between anomalous logs and their resolutions. In this paper, we propose a novel framework LogExpert to automatically generate recommended resolutions for anomalous logs. Specifically, we build a log recognizer to utilize the wealth of software knowledge in technical forums such as Stack Overflow (SO). In addition, LogExpert combines the great power of a Large Language Model (LLM) with domain-specific knowledge to generate the resolution. We conducted a preliminary evaluation of our framework on datasets from SO. Our log recognizer achieves the F1 score of 0.936.

It converts graph matching problem into a path search problem in the space of search states. Under the guidance of the search path, it avoided repeated label checking by inheriting state tree structure for caching and fast visiting matched nodes and edge. By a carefully optimized search route and intelligent backtracking, GE algorithm avoided a large amount of the invalid search states and improved performance to be almost linear to the number of edges of pattern graph with low ambiguity. While traditional TSGM are suffering the call stack overflow problem caused by recursive function calls, it overcame this problem by a dynamic state queue. It can handle extra large size of pattern (up to 10,000 nodes). The experiment shows the performance of GE is better than similar algorithms and it is more resistant to ambiguities.","2158-5709","978-1-4244-3728-3","10.1109/ICWAPR.2009.5207466","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5207466","Subgraph isomorphism;Tree search","Pattern matching;Tree graphs;Computer science;Wavelet analysis;Pattern analysis;Algorithm design and analysis;Pattern recognition;Electronic mail;Search problems;Tree data structures","","","1","15","IEEE","18 Aug 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As a result, the proposed method ensures that relatively long IP-related functions are executed safely.

Today's medical devices are based on embedded architecture, with software used to control the underlying hardware. They are highly critical since errors in the software can endanger end users such as patients and medics. Medical devices should be designed and manufactured in such a way that when used, they perform as intended and they ensure a high level of safety. Current industrial practices are based on testing processes to check if the software meets the specifications and if it fulfills its purpose. However, testing does have several disadvantages that limit the reliability of this verification and validation process. Testing cannot guarantee that a device will function properly under all conditions and bugs can never be completely identified withing a program. Several attempts have already been made to provide standards for the formal verification of safety properties of medical devices, initiated by the Generic Infusion Pump project [2]. Our work is a collaboration between Objet Direct R&D and Fresenius [1]. Fresenius is a leading international health care group which produces and markets pharmaceuticals and medical devices. We aim to investigate innovative methods for software development, validation and verification. We study existing results provided amongst others by [3, 4] which we intend to extend by analyzing the Fresenius Infusion Pump (FIP) software. FIP automatizes the delivery process of fluid medical solution into patient's body. Its design is based on three layers. The highest level is the user interface and consists of three components, the administration protocol, the application system and the power management. The middle level consists of the pumping control components and the lowest level contains driver components such as Door, Watchdog, Optical Disk, Motor. FIP is modeled in UML (a total of 100 state machines) and the requirements are written in natural language. The implementation of the model is done in C++ with automatic code generation. For the V&V process, software testing checks if the implementation meets the requirements using fault scenarios written in UML. The main objective of this project is to use model-based design for migrating from software testing to formal based solution for verifying the Fresenius Infusion Pump. The goal is to use model checking technologies in order to verify requirements and eliminate bugs during the design process. Several faulty design patterns have already been identified to be caused by deadlocks, lost signal events, stack overflow, violation of real-time properties, incoherent behavior of UML state machines. We present and analyze the case study of the FIP's Motor component, a driver component of the lowest level. Its interest lies on the fact that while the Motor Control is stopped, the Motor Driver is still running. This faulty behavior was detected during the test checks and bug was partially corrected in code review.","","978-1-4503-1996-6","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6604031","","Unified modeling language;Software;Testing;Safety;Computer bugs;Medical services;Pumps","","","","4","","19 Sep 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Typically, it is costly and time consuming to build a classifier, because this requires collecting training data (e.g., through crowdsourcing), selecting a suitable machine learning algorithm (through extensive tests and using domain-specific knowledge), and optimizing the underlying hyperparameters (applying a good understanding of the classifier's structure). In addition, all this information is typically proprietary and should be protected. With the proposed black-box attack approach, an adversary can use deep learning to reliably infer the necessary information by using labels previously obtained from the classifier under attack, and build a functionally equivalent machine learning classifier without knowing the type, structure or underlying parameters of the original classifier. Results for a text classification application demonstrate that deep learning can infer Naive Bayes and SVM classifiers with high accuracy and steal their functionalities. This new attack paradigm with deep learning introduces additional security challenges for online machine learning algorithms and raises the need for novel mitigation strategies to counteract the high fidelity inference capability of deep learning.","","978-1-5090-6356-7","10.1109/THS.2017.7943475","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7943475","Machine learning;adversarial machine learning;classifier;deep learning;exploratory attacks","Machine learning;Support vector machines;Training data;Neurons;Machine learning algorithms;Organizations;Security","","46","3","19","IEEE","8 Jun 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Ontologies and semantic frameworks are started applied more fields than we could imagine. Nowadays, when Future Internet and Internet of Things (IoT) research became an integral part of the rise of computing, we need to react to new challenges utilizing these aspects. Our University is not an exception, it is a perfect place to study and apply these possibilities. Furthermore, a new computing concept has appeared which had a vision where computing is made to appear everywhere and anywhere. These technological advancements made possible to collect and process a wide range of data. Several ideas are applied at our University Campus where we established a framework which could provide value-added services for various people living or working on the Campus. The main goals of our project - inside the Future Internet field - are twofold. First, establishing an intelligent platform as an extensible architecture which is used to drive the central part (as we call Smart Campus Central Intelligence - SCCI) through an extensible and open interface with data. That data is used not only for data analysis but recommendations as well. Second, the interface should be open for the crowd to made available crowdsourcing inside the system for creating new services. This paper highlights our applied usage scenarios and our vision where we could continue.","","978-1-4799-7280-7","10.1109/CogInfoCom.2014.7020509","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7020509","campus;smart;adaptive;intelligent systems;crowdsourcing","Communities;Sensors;Educational institutions;Databases;Calendars;Conferences;Semantics","","35","","9","IEEE","26 Jan 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In recent years, crowdsourcing systems have been developed to exploit the power of volunteers to facilitate humanitarian logistic efforts. Most of the current systems require volunteers to directly provide input to them and do not have the capability to benefit the large number of disaster-related posts that are published on social media. Hence, many social media posts in the aftermath of disasters remain hidden. Among these hidden posts are those that need immediate attention, such as requests for help. Hence, we have implemented a system that detects requests on Twitter using content and context of tweets.","","978-1-5090-2846-7","10.1109/ASONAM.2016.7752432","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7752432","","Twitter;Tagging;Context;Hurricanes;Earthquakes;Feature extraction","","28","","12","IEEE","24 Nov 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, collecting a lot of labelled data to train an accurate localization model is expensive and labour-intensive. In this paper, an economic and easy-to-deploy indoor localization model suitable for ubiquitous smartphone platforms is established. The method processes embedded inertial sensors readings through a inertial localization system. A particle filter is developed to integrate the building map constraints and inertial localization results to estimate user's location. To increase the algorithm convergence rate, the user's initial/on-line room-level localization is achieved using WiFi signals. To achieve room-level accuracy, only very few training WiFi data, i.e. one per room or per segment of a corridor, are required. A novel crowdsourcing technique to build and update training database is presented. On these basis, an indoor localization system is proposed and evaluated. The results show that comparable location accuracy to previous approaches without even dense wireless site survey requirements is achievable.","","978-1-4799-4671-6","10.1109/WPNC.2014.6843288","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6843288","","IEEE 802.11 Standards;Databases;Compass;Trajectory;Buildings;Accuracy;Training","","26","","13","IEEE","26 Jun 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A rule-based converter was designed and applied on the tweets to convert them from Arabizi to Arabic. Subsequently, the resultant tweets were annotated with their respective sentiment labels using crowdsourcing. This ArabiziDataset consists of 3206 tweets. Results obtained by this work reveal that SVM accuracies are higher than Naive Bayes accuracies. Secondly, removal of stopwords and mapping emoticons to their corresponding words did not greatly improve the accuracies for Arabizi data. Thirdly, eliminating neutral tweets at early stage in the classification improves Precision for both Naive Bayes and SVM. However, Recall values fluctuated, sometimes they got improved; on other times they did not improve.","","978-1-4673-8614-2","10.1109/IACS.2016.7476098","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7476098","Sentiment analysis;polarity classification;supervised learning;Arabic tweets;Arabizi","Support vector machines;Niobium;Crowdsourcing;Filtering;Sentiment analysis;Supervised learning;Writing","","23","","34","IEEE","23 May 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper demonstrates that submitters who stop receiving attention tend to stop contributing, while prolific contributors attract an ever increasing number of followers and their attention in a feedback loop.

Specifically large amount of tweet messages are posted by the users. These can be opinion oriented, sentimental tweets or ones that contribute important information. The latter kind of tweets plays a vital role in decision making during a crisis situation. These types of tweets are referred as situation awareness tweets. Extraction of situation awareness information from Twitter is a non-trivial task as the vocabulary used usually is not formal and presence of short hand words for ease of writing reduces the readability of tweets. Crowdsourcing of data during such a disaster can aid in the task of decision making. In this paper, we propose a technique of extracting situation awareness information using concepts of semi-supervised machine learning along with creating interactive map to locate the vulnerable areas during a disaster.","","978-1-5090-2029-4","10.1109/ICACCI.2016.7732236","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7732236","situation awareness;crowdsourcing;machine learning;interactive map","Crowdsourcing;Satellites;Floods;Classification algorithms;Data visualization;Labeling;Informatics","","22","","21","IEEE","3 Nov 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This research aims to develop a real-time traffic classification by harnessing the power of social network data, Twitter. In this study, Twitter data are processed to the stages of preprocessing, feature extraction, and tweet classification. This study compares classification performance of three machine learning algorithms, namely Naive Bayes (NB), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Decision Tree (DT). Experimental results show that SVM algorithm produced the best performance among the other algorithms with 99.77% and 99.87% of classification accuracy in balanced and imbalanced data, respectively.
