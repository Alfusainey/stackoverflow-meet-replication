One of the main objectives of NEX is to help Earth scientists leverage and reuse various data processing software modules developed by their peers, in order to quickly run value-added executable experiments (workflows). Toward this goal, this paper reports our efforts of leveraging social network analysis to intelligently extract hidden information from data processing workflows. By modeling Earth science workflow modules as social entities and their dependencies as social relationships, this research opens up new vistas for applying social science to facilitate software reuse and distributed workflow development. As a proof of concept, a prototyping system has been developed as a plug-in to the NEX workflow design and management system (VisTrails) to aid Earth scientists in discovering and reusing workflow modules and extending them to solve more complex science problems.","","978-1-4799-3616-8","10.1109/SOSE.2014.23","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6830902","","Collaboration;Earth;Social network services;Mashups;Engines;Context","","2","","31","IEEE","12 Jun 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Many online profiles claim expertise, but possessing true expertise is rare. We characterize expertise as projected expertise (claims of a person), perceived expertise (how the crowd perceives the individual) and true expertise (factual). StockTwits, an investor-focused microblogging platform, allows us to study all three aspects simultaneously. We analyze more than 18 million tweets spanning 1700 days. The large time scale allows us to also analyze expertise and its categories as they evolve over time, which is the first study of its kind on StockTwits. We propose a method to capture perceived expertise by how significantly a user's follower network grows and how often the user is brought up in conversations. We also quantify actual, market-based, true expertise based on the user's trade and investment recommendations. Finally we provide an analysis bringing out the differences between how users project themselves, how the crowd perceives them, and how they are actually performing on the market. Our results show that users who project themselves as experts are ones that talk the most and provide the least recommendation-to-tweet ratio (that is, most of their conversations are mundane). The recommendations from users who project novice expertise slightly outperform (≈5%) the overall stock market. On the other hand, the trade recommendations from self-proclaimed experts yield 80% less than those of intermediate traders. Interestingly, users who are perceived as experts by others, as measured by centrality measurements, resulted in net negative returns after a four year trading period. Our study also looks at the evolution of expertise, and begins to understand why and what makes users change the way they project their own expertise. For this topic, however, this paper introduces more questions than it answers, which will serve as the basis for future studies.","","978-1-5090-5206-6","10.1109/DSAA.2016.45","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7796922","Social Networks;Stock Market;Microblogging Data;Information Retrieval;Opinion Mining;Expertise","Twitter;Stock markets;Investment;Internet;Context;Knowledge engineering","","1","","25","IEEE","26 Dec 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The developed ontology is based on the main concepts defined in the Rational Unified Process (RUP) and the relationships between them. The ontology provides mechanisms to reason and infer knowledge in domains that are not explicitly declared. It can facilitate team members in obtaining information which is necessary to complete collaborative tasks, such as software traceability, software component reuse or identifying missing information.

This vulnerability is particularly concerning due to the clients’ utilization of cybersecurity models aimed at securing the network against cyber intrusions and attacks. This study investigates the utilization of Gaussian and Laplace differential privacy (DP) mechanisms by clients during local training to obfuscate their model parameters, thereby mitigating the risk of data leakage. Extensive simulations utilizing the edge-IIoT dataset, validate the effectiveness of perturbing client models, in terms of upholding privacy and enhancing global model performance.

The robots - autonomous agents - should cooperate with each other while planning and executing tasks required for achieving various missions. While designing multi-robotic systems, especially for such critical applications as surveillance and rescue operations, we should ensure that the missions could be successfully completed despite robot failures. Therefore, guaranteeing system fault tolerance constitutes an important design goal. However, achieving fault tolerance for multi-agent systems is a notoriously difficult task due to highly decentralized control and asynchronous communication between the agents. In this paper, we propose a formalization of fault tolerance behavior of cooperative mission planning for the multi-robotic system. Our model incorporates such essential fault tolerance mechanisms as the cooperative error recovery and dynamic reconfiguration. To demonstrate how to specify and verify essential fault tolerance requirements, we propose several dedicated mechanisms for knowledge sharing between the robots, which enable cooperative planning. We define the mission as a set of goals that should be accomplished by a collaborative functioning of the robots and derive the conditions for enabling fault tolerant planning and coordinated execution.","2576-3555","978-1-6654-9607-0","10.1109/CoDIT55151.2022.9804073","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9804073","multi-agent systems;planning;fault tolerance;coordination","Fault tolerance;Robot kinematics;Surveillance;Fault tolerant systems;Collaboration;Autonomous agents;Planning","","1","","19","IEEE","30 Jun 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This objective can be done either by the customer (using an application manager) or by the provider (with a server consolidation system). A cooperative resource management policy exploits elastic VMs and knowledge sharing between the customer and the provider in order to support splitting and merging virtual machines. ""Splitting"" VMs will help in optimizing resource usage while ""merging"" collocated VMs (ones that are placed on the same physical server) reduces performance and memory overhead. This combined policy aims at saving cost for the two actors and improve performance for the customer. A set of experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of the cooperative resource management policy was performed using a small, private IaaS. However, the verification of this policy must be evaluated in a larger scope. In this paper, we describe the cooperation policy, our cloud resource management simulation framework, and then demonstrate our large scale experiment with our proposed cooperative resource management policy using the framework. The evaluation shows that our policy outperforms uncoordinated resource management in traditional IaaS with better virtualized and physical resource usage.","","978-1-4673-8013-3","10.1109/KSE.2015.13","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7371754","Cloud Computing;Resource Management;Cooperation;Simulation;Framework","Resource management;Servers;Cloud computing;Merging;Computational modeling;Runtime","","1","","16","IEEE","7 Jan 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In the context of edge service development, coupling edge systems, software models for edge services and blockchain technologies is complex. Thus, a strong collaboration and knowledge sharing for edge systems and blockchain technologies will help addressing many concerns of the developer. However, there is a lack of frameworks for sharing knowledge about blockchain software artefacts and deployments for edge services. In this paper, we present various types of information linking blockchain performance with service deployments at different levels. We represent and associate benchmarked performance information of blockchain operation and blockchain infrastructural services with common edge service interactions and resource deployments.

It can also be useful for various tasks including demonstration, knowledge-sharing, online programming, database sharing, results comparison in the stereo vision research community, and recreation used by non-specialists. In contrast with many existing systems that use stereo cameras, our proposed one only use a single camera. However, the acquired image streams are divided into two side by side images by a 3D Mini Camera Lens. The use of the lens has some advantages over the state of the art ones. It is very low-cost, at 5-7 USD; it can be implemented with any small image sensors of web cams, smartphones, tablets. The lens is light weight, simple to assemble and disassemble, convenient and portable; and its two stereo pictures are perfectly synchronised (as the same image sensor produces them). We develop a fully functioning system which horizontally aligns images and calculates the dense distance map of the scene using a guided semi-global stereo matching algorithm. The simple horizontal and vertical image alignment is very lightweight, using adaptive methods, and is carried out during the stereo matching; thus, no separated processes are needed. The semi-global stereo matching uses full or partial profiles generated by local block matching algorithms to achieve an efficient dynamic programming stereo matching and produce higher-quality disparity maps. The system is, therefore, plug-and-play, no special setup or calibration is required. The system gradually estimates the best parameters, including disparity range, to produce the most suitable depth image. The evaluated results have shown that this system was demonstrably accurate, fast, and relatively robust for stereo correspondence. It could be used in many simple stereo vision system such as computer games, gesture control, robotic vision, self-flying drones or -driving cars.","","978-1-5090-6546-2","10.1109/M2VIP.2017.8211465","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8211465","Computer stereo vision;robot system;3D re-construction","Cameras;Three-dimensional displays;Lenses;Stereo vision;Image reconstruction;Heuristic algorithms","","1","","20","IEEE","18 Dec 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Companies involved in such smart productions act in highly competitive global markets and always have to find new ways to, e.g., cut costs by changing to the best providers, or enabling, e.g., tax savings, to stay competitive. This can only be achieved by using the fastest, most effective, efficient, and flexible distributed collaborative production processes. In this context, a Collaborative Adaptive Production Process Planning (CAPPP) can be supported by semantic product data management approaches enabling production-knowledge representation, utilization, curation, and archival as well as knowledge sharing, access, and reuse in many flexible and efficient ways. To support such scenarios, semantic representation of production knowledge integrated into a machine-readable process formalization is a key enabling factor for sharing such explicit knowledge resources in cloud-based production knowledge repositories. Our approach of Knowledge-Based Production Planning (KPP) introduces such a method and already provides a corresponding prototypical Proof-of-Concept implementation. In this way, it can not only be used in production planning but also, e.g., in Collaborative Manufacturing Change Management (CMCM) as well as, e.g., in Collaborative Assembly-, Logistics- and Layout Planning (CALLP) both building on the results of CAPPP. Therefore, a collaborative planning and optimization from mass to lot-size one production in a machine readable and processable representation will be possible. On the other hand, KPP knowledge can be shared to support other types of innovation, collaboration, and cocreation within a cloud-based semantic production knowledge repository.","2374-9709","978-1-7281-4973-8","10.1109/NOMS47738.2020.9110364","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9110364","Smart Production Planning Service;Manufacturing;Production;Assembly;Planning;Smart Product;Smart Service;Smart Production;Knowledge-based;Semantics","Technological innovation;Semantics;Process planning;Layout;Knowledge based systems;Collaboration;Production","","1","","24","IEEE","8 Jun 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Historically, selection of innovative proposals at NASA Ames Research Center is done at the highest levels of management, isolating the views and perspectives of the larger civil servant community. Additionally, NASA innovation programs are typically open to technical organizations and do not engage non-technical organizations to bring forward innovative processes/business practices. Finally, collaboration on innovative ideas and associated solutions tend to be isolated to organizational silos. In this environment, not all Ames employees feel empowered to innovate and opportunities for employee collaboration are limited. In order to address these issues, the `innovation contest' method was adapted to create the NASA Ames Innovation Fair, a unique, grassroots innovation opportunity for the civil servant community. The Innovation Fair consisted of a physical event with a virtual component. The physical event provided innovators the opportunity to collaborate and pitch their innovations to the NASA Ames community. The civil servant community then voted for the projects that they viewed as innovative and would contribute to NASA's core mission, making this event a truly grassroots effort. The Innovation Fair website provided a location for additional knowledge sharing, discussion, and voting. On March 3rd, 2016, the `First Annual NASA Ames Innovation Fair' was held with 49 innovators and more than 300 participants collaborating and/or voting for the best innovations. Based on the voting results, seven projects were awarded seed funding for projects ranging from innovative cost models to innovations in aerospace technology. Surveys of both innovators and Fair participants show the Innovation Fair was successful in fostering cross-organizational collaborations, soliciting participation of non-technical innovations, and increasing employee engagement in influencing the future of NASA Ames Research Center. The grassroots component of the Innovation Fair has been bench marked by the agency as a solid foundation for increasing employee engagement in the development of game changing aerospace technology and processes in support of NASA's mission.","","978-1-5090-1613-6","10.1109/AERO.2017.7943977","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7943977","","Technological innovation;NASA;Collaboration;Proposals;Production","","1","","16","IEEE","8 Jun 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Taking into account the previous considerations, we propose a topology-based model for JA named TOP-JAM, which is able to represent and track in real-time JA states, from observations of behavioral data. More importantly, the model consists in a representation that can be directly understood by human beings, which conforms to robo-ethical principles in social robotics. This study evaluates computational properties of the model in simulation. Through a real experiment with the robot Pepper, the study shows that TOP-JAM is able to track JA in a triad interaction scenario.","","979-8-3503-2365-8","10.1109/ICRA48891.2023.10160488","Agence Nationale de la Recherche(grant numbers:ANR-19-PI3A-0004); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10160488","joint attention;neural robotics;social robotics;human-robot interaction;bio-inspired modeling","Visualization;Computational modeling;Biological system modeling;Human-robot interaction;Brain modeling;Real-time systems;Topology","","1","","38","IEEE","4 Jul 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Libraries are responding to patrons' needs by providing digital resources and services, and collaborative spaces that invite communication and knowledge sharing. In order to effectively meet patrons' needs, libraries are striving to efficiently manage their human, materials, and fiscal resources. Libraries have traditionally measured efficiency by developing single factor productivity indexes. However, these qualitative methods do not adequately address the efficiency aspect which measures the transformation of resources (inputs) into services (outputs). Data envelopment analysis (DEA) measures the relative efficiencies of a decision making unit with multiple inputs and outputs. The DEA methodology has been applied to libraries over the past twenty years. This paper proposes a DEA evaluation model that faculty, in their advisory and advocacy shared governance roles, can employ to strengthen their libraries. The model is demonstrated by analyzing the efficiency of the Portland State University Branford Price Millar Library to its peer institution libraries for the academic year 2011-2012.","2159-5100","978-1-8908-4331-1","10.1109/PICMET.2015.7273170","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7273170","","Libraries;Data envelopment analysis;Education;Data models;Best practices;Information science;Logic gates","","1","","32","","24 Sep 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As a result, designing context-aware systems to support decision making in cross-boundary e-health poses a huge challenge because of the inherent difficulty in establishing a shared context of work and users adequate for supporting knowledge sharing and decision making among workers across organisational and geographical boundaries. In this paper, we propose a context model, which we refer to as practice ontology, to enable cross-boundary decision support in e-health.

The main operating cost is electricity, and it is necessary to research solutions to reduce energy consumption in such production. In the literature, it is possible to find experimental setups of CEA, but they are often based on hardware (controllers, sensors and actuators) that are not typically used in industrial applications. This work aims to design and implement a laboratory for indoor vertical farming with industrial standards. Hardware and software are chosen in order to mirror the setup that would be used in bigger production facilities. The setup is completely autonomous and allows visualisation and manual control of the main control parameters. The system will allow further research to optimize vertical farming.

For industrial applications, especially Industrial IoT (IIoT), it is highly desired to transfer the video content with limited bandwidth and process the video using constrained resources, which makes compressed video processing a very challenging problem. Recently, there have been extensive works focusing on compressed video quality enhancement (VQE) tasks, many of which deploy dedicated and complex CNNs to reach amazing performances. Such advancements have enabled various applications in video-based tasks. On the other hand, since deep neural networks often require high computational resources, such complex CNNs can hardly be deployed on the embedded devices. Thus, model pruning technique and inference optimization have been appealing options for efficient deployment of VQE under resource-constrained environments. In this paper, we incorporate a novel deformable convolution method into our network architecture and propose a light-weight method for compressed video quality enhancement on an embedded platform for IIoT. The proposed system has outperformed several SOTA light-weight quality enhancement models and can achieve 15.230 FPS and 0.773 FPS/W on MFQEv2 dataset [1].","","978-1-6654-2755-5","10.1109/ICITES53477.2021.9637075","National Key R&D Program of China(grant numbers:2018YFE0126300); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9637075","video processing;inference;IIoT;light-weight;embedded platform","Performance evaluation;Embedded systems;Convolution;Focusing;Network architecture;Quality assessment;Task analysis","","1","","22","IEEE","20 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Despite these efforts, cotton cultivation continues to face repeated attacks by pests. To limit crop losses due to these attacks, systematic plant health surveillance has been put in place. The problems encountered in this systematic surveillance led to the development of a mobile application to collect and transfer data in real time. Unfortunately, the mobile solution implemented does not allow knowledge sharing or semantic search for the discovery of new knowledge. To enable and facilitate semantic reasoning in this system, we chose to couple the mobile version with a semantic web platform based on a domain ontology for plant health surveillance of cotton. This article presents the construction of this ontology that we will call ontoSYSPARCOTCI in what follows. The methodology used to build this ontology is NeO$n$. We started by listing all the ontological and non-ontological resources useful and necessary for the construction of the ontology. We then used scenarios 1,2,3 5 and 7 for its construction.

Complexity and variability of patterns, and the required expertise for selecting an appropriate pattern, would cause some difficulties in utilizing architectural patterns. Using an ontology for registering architectural patterns is an efficient step in solving those problems. However, the mentioned difficulties make the process of constructing the architectural patterns ontology even more complicated. This paper proposes an approach that considers the construction of the architectural patterns ontology from four perspectives in order to overcome this complexity. Each of these perspectives has certain functionality. The ontology engineer deals with large volumes of patterns that would complicate registration of them in the ontology. Thus, the using of a relational database as an ontology learning resource is considered in this approach and the learning process is explained in knowledge extraction perspective. Sometimes, all knowledge of patterns (the possible interactions of patterns and the architect decisions) is not explicitly stored. Knowledge storage and representation perspective is placed in this approach in order to describe knowledge of patterns and to infer further knowledge. How retrieving an appropriate pattern is discussed in knowledge retrieval perspective. Knowledge sharing is another perspective that discusses how making the patterns ontology available for software architecture stakeholders.","","978-1-5090-5579-1","10.1109/ICEMIS.2016.7745299","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7745299","Knowledge Management;Software Architecture Patterns;Ontology;Semantic Web Technologies","Ontologies;Software architecture;Documentation;OWL;Computer architecture;Complexity theory;Databases","","1","","38","IEEE","17 Nov 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Studies show that members of product development teams spend more and more time for communication, information and document management and have less time for the creative part. Online and off-line collaboration tools address the needs of CE but searching for information and sharing knowledge still follows the old metaphor of knowledge management, i.e. knowledge can only be shared (and accessed) when a common terminology is used. To overcome this limitation, we aim to investigate emerging Semantic Web technologies that offer new possibilities through modelling and using the domain knowledge to better support users of different disciplines to exchange information and knowledge without using the other parties terminology. This paper presents one of the first approaches to tackle information and knowledge sharing by using the latest - still emerging - Semantic Web technologies. We present the system's motivation, architecture and use examples. Furthermore we report on results from user test (done by users from Schenck Pegasus GmbH and Italdesign Giugiaro).

The Integrated Information Framework (I2F) was established to provide the services and resources necessary to support this interoperability between collaborative enterprise solutions utilized throughout the lifecycle of large scale live, virtual, and constructive (LVC) events. This interoperability allows AF-ICE community members to continue using their existing collaborative systems for local development of work products, while also contributing to the development of work products across organizational boundaries and systems. The I2F provides a focused virtual work environment tying together people and assets necessary to support various MS&A activities and includes an interoperable document management system, a community of practice knowledge sharing capability, adaptive MS&A event management process workflows/descriptions, and an adaptive, knowledge database/repository. The purpose of this paper is to provide an overview of I2F and its key concepts, an explanation of the concept of operations for distributed document management between collaborative systems, and information regarding the development of the initial operating capabilities realized through the specification of an interoperability services framework that standardizes communication between the I2F and collaborative systems.","","978-0-9785699-1-4","10.1109/CTS.2007.4621772","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4621772","Interoperability;Web Services;Collaborative Environments;Document Management","Collaboration;Communities;Atmospheric modeling;Adaptive systems;Analytical models;Organizations;Synchronization","","1","","5","IEEE","5 Sep 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper investigates the factors that support, and deter, pair programming adoption in a case study at a software development company in the eThekwini (Durban) region, South Africa. The survey and interviews indicate that the most positive influences are the support from senior and peer staff and the company's willingness to provide the necessary hardware, software and physical layout to enable the use of pair programming. The biggest challenge was the personality mix in a pair, for example introvert/extrovert pairs, where extroverts can dominate pair collaboration. This company has specific managerial guidelines and practices which are used to mitigate the challenges and provide support to, not only make pair programming a more operationally feasible option, but also reap its benefits.","","978-1-7281-6770-1","10.1109/icABCD49160.2020.9183869","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9183869","pair programming;XP (extreme programming);software developer","Programming;Software;Companies;Industries;Productivity;Agile software development;Collaboration","","1","","17","IEEE","1 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This has made the retrieval a difficult task. There are plenty of documents everywhere about anything and everything a human mind can think about. All this information is mostly presented transferred and shared using natural language. The biggest challenge and research area has been to enable machines understand and decipher what has been communicated to it through natural language. There are document classification systems that classifies and groups the documents that are speaking about the same concept. But the same type of classification is not successfully handled if it happens to be based on spatial keywords. This is due to the inherent ambiguity and uncertainty that is associated with the spatial terms found in natural language descriptions. Text documents imply the usage of natural language and as such it yields to explicit vague fuzzy descriptions involving linguistic terms such as near to, far from, to the east of, very close and also implicit vague spatial references. Event reporting in case of disasters or in case of special occasions is also generally done using free form text rather than structured methods since it allows more detailed descriptions to be added in. Much of these afore said text documents acting as an information source and the query posed by the user implicitly have a geographic or spatial reference component present in it. This logically leads to the conclusion by the previous studies that more than 80% of the searches are pertaining to geographic locations. Fuzzy logic is an extension to the Boolean crisp logic to accommodate for the fuzziness of an element belonging to a set. This paper studies the feasibility of fuzzy logic techniques in resolving the spatial uncertainty in text and presents a Fuzzy ERM (Extraction, Resolving and Modeling) architecture for the same.","","978-1-4799-3834-6","10.1109/ICICES.2014.7033770","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7033770","Spatial Uncertainty;Fuzzy Logic;Possibility Theory;Granulation","Uncertainty;Information retrieval;Natural languages;Fuzzy logic;Fuzzy sets;Spatial resolution;Educational institutions","","1","","35","IEEE","9 Feb 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Modern tools are required for searching, selecting and processing relevant data as well as for systematizing the acquired knowledge. The authors describe the TRIZ-evolutionary approach as a tool for describing and revealing trends of artificial systems development on the example of machine translation systems. Development of any system is headed to the increase of ideality, i.e. increase of utility while reducing costs. At that, contradictions in the system prevent the ideality from increasing. Development occurs after such contradictions are eliminated. As per the TRIZ-evolutionary approach, the evolution of systems is being described from contradiction to contradiction and indicates TRIZ tools that allowed eliminating the contradictions. Such a description allows not only to systematize knowledge on relevant systems, but also to offer new high-performance solutions. The article covers main generations and paradigms of machine translation such as word-for-word machine translation, rule-based translation, statistical and neural machine translation. The analysis by means of the TRIZ-evolutionary approach allowed to trace the evolution of these systems, define main performance parameters, reveal trends and prospects of development taking into account ideality increase. The process of obtaining new effective solutions by eliminating subsequent contradictions is shown.

This paper describes how a vendor's organisational structures have been used to overcome the struggle associated with knowledge sharing in a virtual environment. The vendor has developed workgroup structures involving new boundary roles for building relationships with clients and coordination of project schedules at offshore development sites. Vendor employees located at the client country interpret the implicit knowledge related to the client's functional work processes, which are then translated over a centralised organisational portal to offshore development locations. Regular updates are maintained in the organisational portal to provide information on current project tasks to both clients and distributed team members.

To answer this question, the main objective of this study is to empirically explore the relevance of team culture in multiple project management.

To better understand and reuse knowledge, it is necessary to relate it with the context in which the knowledge is generated and used.

This paper reports initial empirical findings from a collaborative project called the 'Digital Mandi'. The digital ecosystem entails a series of interconnected and intra-dependant digital platforms, created at key institutional levels (international, national and local/Community) augmented by technical (ICT) and social networking processes that help break down barriers to both horizontal and vertical knowledge sharing. The empirical findings show that the 'ecosystem' approach speeds up the process of identification, development and uptake of innovation.

Semantic languages seem to provide effective means to express, process and reason about context information and to facilitate knowledge sharing and interoperability among previously unknown entities. However, the exploitation of semantic languages for the design and deployment of context-aware applications requires to address several issues. In particular, semantic languages require complex and heavyweight support facilities, e.g., reasoning engines, ontology repositories and knowledge management tools, that may not fit the capabilities of portable devices, especially of resource-limited ones. Novel middleware-level solutions are required to transparently and dynamically adapt semantic-based service provisioning to the properties of different access devices. The paper proposes a novel middleware that exploits the visibility of two kinds of metadata, user/device/service profiles and policies, to tailor the configuration of the semantic support functionalities needed to access semantic-based services, and that offers a wide set of mechanisms for making viable semantic-based service provisioning to resource-constrained portable devices","","0-7695-2508-3","10.1109/SAINT.2006.26","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1581325","","Context-aware services;Ontologies;Pervasive computing;Search engines;Semantic Web;Random access memory;Knowledge management;Read-write memory;Middleware;Employment","","1","","24","IEEE","13 Feb 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Drawing on literature in knowledge sharing and organizational justice, we develop hypotheses about how various dimensions of perceived justice of validation procedures influence employees' perceptions of knowledge quality within the repository and their knowledge contributions to it. Analysis of survey data collected at a large North American technical support company reveals that both quality perceptions and contribution behaviors are positively influenced by perceived procedural justice of validation, but not by perceived informational or interpersonal justice.

Its potential is tempered by data collection, confidentiality, and privacy concerns. In tandem with AI-enabled technologies, edge computing can provide a practical solution to overcoming many of these challenges. This paper argues that combining AI-enabled technologies with edge computing-specifically via federated learning (FL) can address these challenges. FL, as a privacy-centric distributed machine learning (ML) approach, enables knowledge sharing among Metaverse clients without compromising user data. However, while FL posits potential resolutions for the Metaverse, a discernible lacuna remains in the comprehensive study of its overarching consequences. The literature misses an extensive study of adopting these new deployment architectures, giving it significant research impact. This paper bridges this knowledge gap, exploring the symbiosis between the Metaverse and FL. We first introduce the foundational concepts of both domains and detail enabling technologies such as digital twins, the Internet of Things, brain-computer interfaces, blockchain, and extended reality. Next, we delve into practical applications of FL within the metaverse, spanning sectors like healthcare, education, e-commerce, gaming, and the military.

Researches and applications developed in recent years show the numerous difficulties and obstacles in extracting key information from documents. Thanks to the raising of graph theory and deep learning, graph representation and graph learning have been widely applied in information extraction to obtain more exact results. In this paper, we propose a solution upon graph neural networks (GNN) for key information extraction (KIE) that aims to extract the key information from mobile-captured Vietnamese receipt images. Firstly, the images are pre-processed using U2-Net, and then a CRAFT model is used to detect texts from the pre-processed images. Next, the implemented TransformerOCR model is employed for text recognition. Finally, a GNN-based model is designed to extract the key information based on the recognized texts. For validating the effectiveness of the proposed solution, the publicly available dataset released from the Mobile-Captured Receipt Recognition (MC-OCR) Challenge 2021 is used to train and evaluate. The experimental results indicate that our proposed solution achieves a character error rate (CER) score of 0.25 on the private test set, which is more comparable with all reported solutions in the MC-OCR Challenge 2021 as mentioned in the literature.

Therefore, the IoT has been producing a wide range of data. Our aim is to deliver a way of incorporating the small data generated by each thing into larger datasets to get more meaning out of these data. A thing, equipped with sensors, can be monitored and can record specific features regarding its behavior. Then it can insert data into a cloud database in order to provide individual-and collective-level analyses. We call this process ""Quantified Things,"" and we present it as a new area for the application of ""Quantified-Self"" and ""Quantified-Community"" that are approaches of the IoT. In this paper, we provide an overview of the Quantified Things (QT) concept and the key requirements for the creation of QT applications. In addition, we present an agent-based model as a solution to meet such requirements. To illustrate the use of this model, we derived an example from one of the Quantified Things applications: ""Quantified Fruit."" Using the ""Quantified Fruit"" concept, some fruit storage use sensors to monitor environmental conditions, such as temperature, relative humidity, lighting and some gases that may affect fruit ripening. In turn, they insert these collected data into a cloud database and consequently enable knowledge sharing. Through these collective experiences, fruit storage may provide an advanced informative perspective on fruit shelf life based on local environmental conditions.","","978-1-4673-9618-9","10.1109/WI-IAT.2015.139","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7396775","quantified things;multi-agent system;quantified self;internet of things","Temperature sensors;Databases;Adaptation models;Internet;Monitoring;Neural networks","","1","","27","IEEE","4 Feb 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, knowledge sharing between users with different preferences is negatively affected. In this paper, we try to share knowledge only among users with similar interests. Specifically, we first propose a user cluster method in the cold start scenario. Then, with the user's cluster information we design a conversion network to transform the global initialization parameters learned by meta learning into the cluster optimal initialization parameters. In this way, we can reduce the negative impact among users with large differences in preferences, and improve the performance of the meta-learning model. Extensive experiments on MovieLens and Yelp demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms the state of the arts in both warm up and cold-start scenarios.","1945-788X","978-1-6654-8563-0","10.1109/ICME52920.2022.9859863","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62076031); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9859863","Recommendation system;eta learning;cold start","Multimedia systems;Transforms","","1","","21","IEEE","26 Aug 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

While generative models are demonstrated effective for several machine learning tasks, their application to time-series classification problems is underexplored. The need for additional exploration is motivated when data are large, annotations are unbalanced or scarce, or data are distributed and fragmented. Recent advances in computer vision attempt to use synthesized samples with system generated annotations to overcome the lack or imbalance of annotated data. However, in multi-view problem settings, view mismatches between the synthetic data and real data pose additional challenges against harnessing new annotated data collections. The proposed method offers important contributions to facilitate knowledge sharing, while simultaneously ensuring an effective solution for domain-specific, finelevel categorizations. We propose a principled way to perform view adaptation in a cross-view learning environment, wherein pairwise view similarity is identified by a smaller subset of source samples that closely resemble the target data patterns. This approach integrates generative models within a deep classification framework to minimize the gap between source and target data. More precisely, we design category specific conditional, generative models to update the source generator in order for transforming source features so that they appear as target features and simultaneously tune the associated discriminative model to distinguish these features. During each learning iteration, the source generator is conditioned by a source training set represented as some target-like features. This transformation in appearance was performed via a target generator specifically learned for target-specific customization per category. Afterward, a smaller source training set, indicating close target pattern resemblance in terms of the corresponding generative and discriminative loss, is used to fine-tune the source classification model parameters. Experiments show that compared to existing approaches, our proposed multiview, generative, transfer learning framework improves timeseries classification performance by around 4% in the UCI multiview activity recognition dataset, while also showing a robust, generalized representation capacity in classifying several large-scale multi-view light curve collections.","","978-1-7281-0858-2","10.1109/BigData47090.2019.9005452","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9005452","Generative Model;GAN;LSTM;RNN;Multiview Classification;Transfer Learning;Distributed Time-Series Analysis;Deep Learning","Data models;Gallium nitride;Generative adversarial networks;Distributed databases;Machine learning;Adaptation models;Generators","","1","","48","IEEE","24 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The lack of clear knowledge boundaries between the acquiring firm and the target firm and critical territories therein can jeopardize knowledge integration in PAI. The case analyses reveal both acquiring and target firms should promptly build and adjust their knowledge boundaries and critical territories, allowing selective, intelligent knowledge sharing and integration. It is also found that critical territory contributes to completing the ever-evolving knowledge cycle by enabling the synthesis and appropriation of PAI knowledge management activities of both the acquiring and target firms. Without the preservation of critical territory, knowledge integration in PAI hampers target firm knowledge management activities and maximum synergy generation, the goal of acquisition.","1530-1605","978-1-4799-2504-9","10.1109/HICSS.2014.447","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6759049","Knowledge management;Post acquisition integration;knowledge boundary;critical territory;knowledge integration;knowledge sharing","Organizations;Knowledge management;Magnetic resonance imaging;Manufacturing;Communities;Interviews;Collaboration","","","","32","IEEE","10 Mar 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Document recommendation methods are very useful to resolve the information overload problem and proactively support knowledge workers in the performance of tasks by recommending appropriate documents to meet their information needs. A worker's document referencing behavior can be modeled as a knowledge flow (KF) to represent the evolution of his/her information needs over time. However, the information needs of workers and groups may change over time. Additionally, most traditional recommendation methods which provide personalized recommendations do not consider workers' KFs, or the information needs of the majority of workers in a group to recommend task knowledge. In this work, the group-based collaborative filtering (GCF) method which integrates the KF mining method is proposed to actively provide task-related documents for groups. Experimental results show that the proposed method has better performance than the personalized recommendation methods in recommending the needed documents for groups.

Traditional collaborative filtering methods often face challenges when dealing with cross-domain recommendation scenarios, where user-item interactions are scattered across multiple domains and data sparsity is prevalent. This research paper proposes a novel Graph Neural Network (GNN) approach for Cross-Domain Collaborative Filtering Recommendations to address these issues. The proposed approach leverages the expressive power of GNNs to capture complex and non-linear patterns in user-item interactions while incorporating cross-domain knowledge. The proposed research paper models the recommendation system as a heterogeneous graph, where users and items are represented as nodes, and the interactions between users and items, as well as the relations between domains, are represented as edges. To train the GNN model, mean squared error loss function is used, which jointly optimizes for domain-specific recommendation performance while encouraging knowledge sharing across multiple domains. Experimental results demonstrate the supremacy of the GNN-based method compared to state-of-the-art collaborative filtering techniques, especially in situations where the cold start problem is a major concern. The GNN-based cross-domain collaborative filtering approach not only outperforms traditional collaborative filtering methods but also exhibits robustness in handling heterogeneous and sparse data across multiple domains. The ability to incorporate cross-domain knowledge makes the proposed model a valuable tool for building recommendation systems in complex and diverse environments. In conclusion, this research presents a comprehensive investigation of the application of Graph Neural Networks to cross-domain collaborative filtering recommendations. The results highlight the effectiveness and versatility of the proposed approach, offering valuable insights and paving the way for further advancements in recommendation systems for cross-domain scenarios.","","979-8-3503-4891-0","10.1109/ICDSAAI59313.2023.10452478","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10452478","Recommender system;GNN;MovieLens 100K dataset;CMU Book Summary dataset;Diversification","Collaborative filtering;Graph neural networks;Robustness;Artificial intelligence;Recommender systems;Faces","","","","26","IEEE","4 Mar 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This further intensify the knowledge-intensive trend of software development, and make the software requirements elicitation activities more complicated. In the knowledge engineering community, an ontology is an explicit specification of a conceptualization. This paper uses the ontology method to construct a requirement knowledge framework and requirement knowledge is expressed as a clear, complete, and consistent hierarchical ontology concept and association, which is more conducive to knowledge sharing and reuse as well as reflects multiple viewpoints of stakeholders. This paper builds a requirements knowledge multi-ontology framework which is divided into GO (generalization ontology), TO (task ontology), DO (domain ontology), and AO (application ontology). And it decomposes the GO into structure ontology and action ontology in the framework. It makes up for the deficiency of undifferentiated knowledge representation of the GO. Then, this paper proposes and integrates the concept of software requirement error pattern into the multi-ontology framework in a consistent form.

This study carefully examines the complex interactions between social media's impact on knowledge sharing and consumer behaviour, as well as how these factors intersect with the newly growing problem of cybercrime. The paper carefully analyses social media's wide audience and ability to shape opinions, placing particular attention on its crucial function in spreading important information during times of crisis. In addition, the study clarifies the wide range of manifestations of cybercrime that are more common in the social media sphere, including phishing, malware attacks, identity theft, online fraud, and cyberbullying. The underlying causes of the rise in cybercrime are carefully examined; they include increased connection, financial incentives, evolving attack methods, human susceptibilities, and the development of cutting-edge technologies. Projections from Statista highlight the terrible financial consequences of cybercrime and highlight the expanding worldwide threat that it poses. The study focuses specifically on the Indian environment, revealing the unsettling frequency of cybercrimes connected to social media and highlighting its function as an enabler for illegal activity. The study also highlights how social media has a profound impact on consumer behaviour, revolutionising interactions with brands and having a significant impact on customer decisions. A thorough analysis of how cybercrime has affected social media marketing demonstrates the decline in user confidence, the rise of false accounts, and the ensuing challenges in identifying real material. The study broadens its scope of inquiry to include the effects of data breaches on the trustworthiness and reputation of businesses. The paper's conclusion emphasises the critical importance of proactive measures designed to lessen the effects of cybercrime on social media marketing. These techniques include thorough personnel training, strong security measures, and the development of strategic alliances. Unwavering vigilance is essential as businesses manage the complex interactions between social media and cybercrime to secure digital operations and uphold the interests of customers.","","979-8-3503-2919-3","10.1109/ICSEIET58677.2023.10303311","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10303311","Social Media;Digital Marketing;Consumer Behaviour;Artificial Intelligence;Social Media Marketing","Training;Technological innovation;Consumer behavior;Social networking (online);Shape;Phishing;Security","","","","37","IEEE","7 Nov 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Bridging systems to work together is increasingly becoming essential for leveraging the Enterprise Information Systems (EIS) and reaching common goals. Semantic sharing represents the daunting barrier for making these systems work together. On the other hand the emergence of Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Knowledge Management Systems over the past few years has changed the scenario. It has overcome the limitations of the conventional knowledge management systems. The existing solutions based on P2P system such as Napster or Guntella[1] provide limited support in information and KM sharing. These drawbacks make the current P2P systems unsuitable for knowledge sharing purposes. Many serious theoretical researches on ontologies were healed to bridge the semantic mismatching problems; the aim of this study is to discuss the semantic sharing problem between different kinds of ontologies. The research focuses on a combination of Description Logics and extending Logics to solve the semantic mismatching between ontologies. We discussed the power and the potential of adding time in the logical concepts relations as a restriction in deferent kinds of ontologies Semantic mismatching and then we focused on P2P ontologies, which offer autonomy and low cost updating.","","978-8-9886-7870-1","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6269216","Ontology;Semantic Web;Peer to Peer (P2P) Ontologies;Description Logic;Temporal Description Logic","Ontologies;Syntactics;Semantics;Xenon;Chemicals;Humans;Proteins","","","","11","","16 Aug 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, in reality, data is distributed across various entities and is subject to various legal and practical constraints. Therefore, it is unrealistic to merge these dispersed datasets into a single large dataset. In order to address this challenge, a novel framework called Federated Transfer Learning (FTL) has been introduced. FTL allows knowledge sharing without jeopardizing user privacy and enables the transfer of complementary knowledge across different domains. This capability enables the use of rich labels from the source domain to construct an effective model tailored to the target domain’s specific needs. In this paper, we propose an improved algorithm, named FTL-FIC, based on FTL for image classification datasets. It leverages federated learning to aggregate data and utilizes transfer learning to construct an shared learning model, thereby adapting to the characteristics of the target dataset. Experimental results demonstrate the algorithm’s notable improvement in the classification accuracy of the target dataset (increased by 8.17%), the reduced number of convergence epochs, and its ability to maintain good generalization on the source dataset. Furthermore, FTL-FIC exhibits versatility and scalability, indicating its potential application to other types of datasets.","2168-3042","979-8-3503-7102-4","10.1109/PAAP60200.2023.10391706","Research and Development; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10391706","machine learning;federated transfer learning;image classification;transfer learning","Adaptation models;Privacy;Machine learning algorithms;Law;Scalability;Transfer learning;Programming","","","","20","IEEE","22 Jan 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In recent years an astonishing paradigm shift has occurred; user-driven, open and collaborative innovation practices have emerged and an increasing number of users mutually collaborate by openly communicating their ideas, sharing best practices, and creating new knowledge across various sectors.. However, there is lot of actions to be done for effective knowledge sharing, open and collaborative innovation. This paper discusses open and collaborative innovation in the context of open educational resources (OERs), proposes related innovation models and makes recommendations for adopting open collaborative innovation. The level of open collaborative innovation in the OER environment is assessed by examining a number of key initiatives in the field. Our analysis, conducted in terms of two dimensions - the orientation of the OER initiative (i.e., open content and open collaborative innovation) and the user orientation (i.e., users as participants and as creators/cocreators) shows that the initiatives under examination only partly meet the criteria associated with these dimensions, with the exception of only one initiative, namely, Open Discovery Space (ODS), which fully meets all criteria. The case study of ODS incorporated in the paper offers further analysis of the characteristics and potential of an initiative that combines the principles of “openness” and “collaboration”. Our findings indicate that with the integration of both principles, Open Educational Resources and Open Education (OE) have the potential to broaden the educational ecosystem beyond its existing boundaries.","2166-1677","978-1-9058-2446-5","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7058160","","Technological innovation;Collaboration;Ecosystems","","","","14","","19 Mar 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Although sparse linear regression has been used for this purpose due to its simplicity, it often selects an excessive number of features to track the disease and assumes a linear relationship between input and output, which might not always hold. To address these limitations, genetic programming-based symbolic regression (GPSR) algorithms have been proposed. GPSR can select the important features by exploring the feature space and learning a regression model without any assumption of model structure. However, the generalization ability of existing GPSR methods still needs to be improved. Considering the multiple related prediction tasks in AD studies, this work proposes a new method called linear scaled GPSR with multi-task feature selection (LSGPMTFS), to promote the prediction performance of each task by knowledge-sharing among multiple tasks. LSGPMTFS has two stages. The first stage learns a specific feature subset for each task. In the second stage, the model for each task is searched on the union of feature subsets selected from the first stage. The experimental results on authentic AD datasets demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can select a small set of important features with better learning and generalization performance compared with other GPSR methods.","","979-8-3503-0836-5","10.1109/CEC60901.2024.10611973","Major Research Plan(grant numbers:92267206); NSFC(grant numbers:62032013); New Zealand Government(grant numbers:VUW1913,VUW1914,VUW2016); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10611973","Genetic programming;Symbolic regression;Alzheimer's disease prediction;Feature selection","Accuracy;Parkinson's disease;Biomarkers;Multitasking;Feature extraction;Prediction algorithms;Space exploration","","","","31","IEEE","8 Aug 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

At the first stage, this system integrates data preprocess, lexicon establishment and database construction together. Then it provides domain users with flexibility and fuzzy mechanism to retrieve information and mine knowledge interactively. The system introduces an approach to obtain joint probability distributions of an arbitrary number of variables of multi valued states. This is fundamental for mining correlation and causal relations from the complex data sources. To attain these objectives, the system creatively exploits the functionalities of the relational database and SQL engine to reduce programming while achieving good performance. All the functionalities are online and hence facilitate resource and knowledge sharing.","","978-0-7695-2874-8","10.1109/FSKD.2007.170","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4406099","","Relational databases;Fuzzy systems;Functional programming;Humans;Data mining;Information retrieval;Probability distribution;Computer science;Software engineering;Technological innovation","","","","20","IEEE","18 Dec 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
