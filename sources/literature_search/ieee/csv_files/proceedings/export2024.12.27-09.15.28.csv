Our survey-based research of two large IT service and consulting organizations was aimed at examining cultural, technological, motivational, and organizational factors, which influence knowledge sharing within an organization from a non-executive employee’s perspective. Study results showed that issues relating to the availability and usability of technology, leadership support and motivating structures were shown to have influences on knowledge sharing. The study also revealed that employee’s willingness to share knowledge was not reduced by their concerns about the loss of power or job insecurity.

In the proposed model, user authorizations permitting access to knowledge in a VE are classified into two levels: basic privileges and extended privileges. The former are evaluated from four-dimensions, i.e. who, what, when and where, while the latter is determined by considering how three domain ontologies, i.e., product, organization and activity, are related. Based on the proposed knowledge access control model, a knowledge access control policy language model is developed to identify the knowledge access control and sharing rules of a VE and all its enterprise members. The knowledge access control model and the policy language model proposed in this study can facilitate VE Knowledge management and sharing across enterprises, enhance knowledge sharing security and flexibility and regulate knowledge sharing to expeditiously reflect changes in the business environment.","2157-362X","978-1-4244-1528-1","10.1109/IEEM.2007.4419523","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4419523","Access control policy;knowledge sharing;ontology;virtual enterprise","Access control;Virtual enterprises;Knowledge management;Authorization;Ontologies;Security;Electronic commerce;Technology management;Engineering management;Virtual manufacturing","","2","2","19","IEEE","4 Jan 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The need to understand this flow of knowledge within an organization is dramatically evidenced in information technology organizations in which insufficient knowledge sharing leads to intellectual capital loss, rework, skills deterioration, and repeated mistakes that increase project costs leading to failure. The goal of the current study was to examine the relationship among knowledge sharing processes at the organizational level - organizational learning factors - the unit level - project learning practices - and the success of the IT project. Twelve organizational learning factors, eleven project learning practices, and nine project success variables were identified and validated through an expert panel review. These constructs were then codified in a survey and distributed to 5,000 IT managers.

The use of knowledge portals for CoP will assist the exchange of knowledge, thus it promotes the learning process. Nevertheless, such portals may encounter many challenges to draw the interest among the members in sharing their knowledge voluntarily. As the result, the portals face inactive participants among the members. Knowledge sharing system such as knowledge portal is useless without knowledge sharing activity among its members. In order to encourage users to share their knowledge, we first must uncover the underlying problems on why the users are reluctant to share their knowledge through the knowledge sharing system.

Through analyses of a field survey of 207 professionals from more than 10 firms in both private and the government sectors, several hypotheses were confirmed. First, higher employee oriented culture predicted increased knowledge sharing behaviour, and this effect was mediated by increased endorsement of organizational knowledge sharing norms. Second, these effects were particularly strong among highly educated employees-that is, among those likely to have knowledge-and skill-intensive occupations. The results suggest that organisational cultures that value employee well-being may foster social norms and attitudes that are conducive to knowledge sharing behaviour, and that this effect may be particularly pronounced in workplaces that require high levels of education.","","978-1-4799-3188-0","10.1109/ITNG.2014.50","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6822254","Knowledge sharing;knowledge management;organisational culture;behaviour;organisational culture dimensions;employee oriented culture;work oriented culture;theory of reasoned action","Organizational aspects;Education;Cultural differences;Knowledge management;Government;Psychology;Lead","","1","","38","IEEE","2 Jun 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Moreover, by employing the robust algorithms of GPT 3.5, ELMTS constructs detailed digital profiles, analyzing and interpreting data to recognize individual patterns, preferences, and knowledge areas. This leads to a Question and Answer (QnA) system that acts like a digital twin, reflecting the knowledge and experiences of its human counterpart. The system's performance, evaluated through metrics such as correctness accuracy, relevance, completeness, and linguistic accuracy, displayed significant improvement post-user enhancements, indicating enhanced precision in data handling and improved response quality. User feedback further underscored ELMTS's effectiveness in aspects like adaptability, decision-making, and personal growth while pointing out challenges in information overload and ethical concerns, thus shaping future refinements for the system. ELMTS aims to preserve individual wisdom and contribute to the collective human intellect, offering a novel, sustainable approach to knowledge sharing and learning.

By taking a social Q&A platform as the research subject, this paper analyzes the difficulties in crawling data from this platform and relevant solutions, designs and implement a data crawling system containing a user information storage module, a highly anonymous and available proxy maintenance module, a node crawling and parsing module, and a data storage module. With these modules, the system is able to crawl data and store it without being restricted by the platform. On this basis, this paper designs and implements a hotspot parsing and grading module. Based on echarts, a historical hotspot display module and a trending hotspot display module are designed to show the historical and trending hotspots on this platform. Then, this paper uses the proposed data crawling module and the hotspot analysis and display system to obtain the data of 31,520 regularized independent topics and the real-time data of 979,815 questions from this social Q&A platform. Based on these data, the historical and trending hotspot analysis on this platform is displayed. The experimental results show that this system has fully met the design objectives.

In this paper, we propose KGXQR, a knowledge graph based explainable question retrieval approach for programming tasks. It uses BERT-based sentence similarity to retrieve candidate Stack Overflow questions that are relevant to a given query. To bridge the knowledge gap and enhance the performance of question retrieval, it constructs a software development related concept knowledge graph and trains a question relevance prediction model to re-rank the candidate questions. The model is trained based on a combined sentence representation of BERT-based sentence embedding and graph-based concept embedding. To help understand the relevance of the returned Stack Overflow questions, KGXQR further generates explanations based on the association paths between the concepts involved in the query and the Stack Overflow questions.

In this paper we investigate the question whether information harvested from stack traces obtained from the GitHub issue tracker and Stack Overflow Q&A forums can be used in order to complement statically built call graphs. For this purpose, we extract reflective call graph edges from parsed stack traces, and check whether these edges are correctly computed by Doop, a widely used tool for static analysis with built-in support for reflection analysis. We do find edges that Doop misses when analysing real-world programs, even when reflection analysis is enabled. This suggests that mining techniques are a useful tool to test and improve the soundness of static analysis.","","978-1-5386-3681-7","10.1109/APSEC.2017.83","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8306000","stack trace analysis;static analysis;empirical studies;soundness;call graph construction;mining software repositories","Static analysis;Tools;Java;Data mining;Software;Analytical models;Image edge detection","","5","","26","IEEE","5 Mar 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, due to unresolved simple names and last-mile syntax errors, such partial code is frequently not compilable. To facilitate partial code reuse, we develop PCR-Chain for resolving FQNs and fixing last-mile syntax errors in partial code based on a giant pre-trained code model (e.g., Copilot). Methodologically, PCR-Chain is backed up by the underlying global-level prompt architecture (which combines three design ideas: hierarchical task breakdown, prompt composition including sequential and conditional structures, and a mix of prompt-based AI and non-AI units) and the local-level prompt design. Technically, we propose PCR-Chain, which employs in-context learning rather than supervised fine-tuning with gradient updates on downstream task data. This approach enables the frozen, giant pre-trained code model to learn the desired behavior for a specific task through behavior-describing prompts and imitate it to complete the task. Experimental results show that PCR-Chain automatically resolves the FQNs and fixes last-mile syntax errors in 50 partial code samples collected from Stack Overflow with high success rates, without requiring any program analysis. The correct execution of the unit, module, and PCR-Chain demonstrates the effectiveness of the prompt design, prompt composition, and prompt architecture.

The factor scores estimated were subsequently used for finding respondents who would be expected to give appropriate answers to a posted question. Then, in order to consider the semantics of the Q&A statement, word2vecs were appended to the feature values of statements to estimate factor scores. It was demonstrated that word2vec showed the potential of improving estimation accuracy, regardless of the feature values based on 2-gram or syntactic information. For the method using N -gram, it would be necessary to analyze whether longer units than 2-gram could be applicable to this methodology. Thus, this paper aims to append N-gram beyond 3-gram to word2vec and closing sentence expressions as the feature values of statements. The analysis result, taking cross-validation into consideration, has shown that word2vec, as well as units of either 3-gram, 4-gram, or 5-gram, would be applicable to estimating factor scores of Q&A statements.","","979-8-3503-9419-1","10.1109/BCD61269.2024.10743094","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science(grant numbers:26008587); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10743094","Q&A Site;Factor Score;Multiple Regression Analysis;word2vec;N-gram","Cloud computing;Accuracy;Reviews;Semantics;Estimation;Syntactics;Data science;Big Data;Feature extraction;Regression analysis","","","","18","IEEE","8 Nov 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In order to encourage quality contributions, community members are asked to nominate the ‘best’ among the answers provided to a question. The service then awards extra points to the author who provided the winning answer and to the voters who cast their vote for that answer. The best answers are typically selected by plurality voting, a scheme that is simple, yet vulnerable to random voting and collusion. We propose a weighted voting method that incorporates information about the voters’ behavior. It assigns a score to each voter that captures the level of agreement with other voters. It uses the voter scores to aggregate the votes and determine the best answer. The mathematical formulation leads to the application of the Brouwer Fixed Point Theorem which guarantees the existence of a voter scoring function that satisfies the starting axiom.

The feature values of syntactic information were initially extracted through morphological analysis and utilized for multiple regression analysis to obtain factor scores for any Q&A statements. The calculation of factor scores has also been realized by extracting syntactic information through N-gram applied to Part-of-Speech extracted by way of morphological analysis. However, most of our methods so far have been dependent on Japanese, and so we need to validate if our method can be extended to other languages as well. So far, in a similar way as in Japanese, the nine factors have also experimentally been obtained from English Q&A statements. It was confirmed as well that the factor scores were calculated using the feature values of English statements extracted through morphological analysis. Therefore, in this paper, 2-gram as well as morphological analysis was applied to the feature values of English Q&A statements.

Question responding is a narrative job that necessitates knowledge of the context of the conversation. Conversational Question Answering(CQA) incorporates contextual knowledge, co-reference resolution, and passage comprehension, in contrast to single-turn machine reading comprehension tasks. Because of recently popular datasets, including the Conversational Question Answering Challenge (CoQA), Question Answering in Context(QuAC), and Community Question Answering(CQA) tasks, it has become slightly easy, and recent work has achieved competitive performance on both datasets. However, some challenges still need to be solved to make a more efficient conversational question-answering system.

To answer this question, we develop a model of a task / server matching system. For this model, we give a necessary and sufficient condition for an incoming stream of tasks to be manageable by the system. We further identify a so-called back-pressure policy under which the throughput that the system can handle is optimized. We show that this policy achieves strictly larger throughput than a natural greedy policy. Finally, we validate our model and confirm our theoretical findings with experiments based on logs of Math.

Uncovering, implementing and sustaining business models in industrial symbiosis requires the exchange of information and knowledge between industrial actors, third parties and technologies. Yet, despite information and knowledge sharing being considered pivotal, few researchers investigate this matter in depth. Therefore, this paper examines the current state of industrial symbiosis research, focusing on knowledge sharing and the role of information and communication technology (ICT) by reviewing and synthesizing the scientific literature. Thereby critical points and research gaps are highlighted. Findings are, that the majority of researchers studies the exchange of information/knowledge related to ICT, with a trend towards semantic web technologies. However, these tools are not integrated into the overall business process to join industrial symbiosis activities. Furthermore, the complexity of knowledge sharing as a whole is hardly investigated nor implemented.","2378-1971","978-1-7281-0650-2","10.1109/CBI.2019.00010","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8808029","industrial symbiosis;industrial ecology;knowledge sharing;information sharing;ICT","Symbiosis;Information and communication technology;Systematics;Biological system modeling;Ecology;Knowledge management","","17","","59","IEEE","22 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Horizontal and vertical knowledge sharing is a great challenge in the domain of manufacturing. We describe a case study where we replace handwritten incident and maintenance documentation. The main problems associated with handwritten documentation are bad readability and non-shareability. In this paper we describe our Incident Localization and Assistance System (ILAS), an incident documentation and maintenance system. ILAS transfers process oriented incident management knowledge from IT Service Management (ITSM) to the domain of manufacturing. ILAS offers real-time monitoring using wearables, incident analysis support and knowledge sharing for incidents within and among different production sites. We implemented ILAS as a Cyber-Physical Human System. Additionally, we conducted a survey about the potential of wearables within Industry 4.0.

Furthermore, this process of providing resources must consider multiple criteria including teacher's experience, students' level of education, cultural background, teaching style and various learning styles. As a result, we find ourselves in front of a more complex problem which needs standardization of resources' description. This unified description of resources can be achieved through a well-represented ontology that strengthens the knowledge-sharing value between teachers granting resources delivery for the intended teacher. This paper introduces a teacher context ontology (TCO) which can be used to organize the knowledge-sharing between teachers through an educational resources recommender system. The ontology contains multiple concepts; teacher profile, resource, targeted audience, and the context in which the teacher uses this resource. MEMORAe is a platform which provides knowledge organization in a collaborative environment. Therefore, TCO benefits from MEMORAe to organize the knowledge-sharing of experiences and resources between teachers.","","978-1-7281-6597-4","10.1109/CSCWD49262.2021.9437622","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9437622","ontology;semantic web;educational resource;education","Conferences;Education;Standards organizations;Collaboration;Standardization;Organizations;Ontologies","","5","","33","IEEE","28 May 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The research idea is to improve the information system, strengthen internally and externally focused knowledge sharing activities, as well as to characterize the highest average level of group cooperation. A precondition for defining the level of group cooperation is the emphasis on each member's individual characteristics and cooperation skills. In order to find the most efficient data management technology, it is necessary to study different knowledge sharing methods, which will help to understand what information systems need to be used to reach the set goals. There is an important shift in educational focus from remembering large amounts of information to developing one's ability to solve problems and quickly find the necessary information.

The model ties together processes and content of knowledge sharing through two task dimensions, each of them subdivided into two phases: (1) Conception and implementation of the project, and (2) Exploration and exploitation of knowledge. I show that the implementation of ICT-enabled innovation projects requires a balanced mix of exploration and exploitation of knowledge, where exploration through sparse networks is more important in the conceptual phase, and exploitation in tightly-bound groups becomes more fruitful in the implementation phase.","1530-1605","0-7695-2268-8","10.1109/HICSS.2005.146","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1385749","","Collaboration;Communication system control;Technological innovation;Internet;Innovation management;Knowledge management;Production;Collaborative work;Recruitment;Customer satisfaction","","2","","45","IEEE","24 Jan 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This is because of the enabled intelligent human-to-computer conversation in the form of text and speech. These abilities have been contributed by the presence of well-developed and accurate datasets built using well-structured procedures. Unfortunately, domain-specific datasets are limited. This brought the need for this study as it focused on identifying aflatoxin knowledge areas to be used to develop aflatoxin knowledge datasets. These datasets will then be used to develop an aflatoxin knowledge-sharing question-and-answer chatbot. The chatbot will enable aflatoxin knowledge-sharing for awareness creation. The questions and answers grouped as knowledge areas for building the dataset were collected through a data collection process. This was a user-centered approach where focus group discussions were conducted to capture aflatoxin-related questions from expected users. These were the maize and groundnut stakeholders including farmers, traders, consumers, and extension officers. On the other hand, responses to the collected questions were provided by researchers and experts through conducted interview sessions. In the data collection process, 7 focus group discussions and 9 interview sessions were conducted in seven regions in Tanzania named; Arusha, Dodoma, Iringa, Morogoro, Tabora, Mtwara, and Dar-es-salaam. The results of the study presented 6 themes (knowledge areas) with respective sub-themes. These themes are: 1) Meaning of Aflatoxin 2) Effects of Aflatoxin 3) Management of Contaminated crops 4) Laws and Regulations 5) Prevention and 6) Aflatoxin awareness creation. These will then be used to develop English and Swahili datasets for developing an aflatoxin knowledge-sharing chatbot.","","979-8-3503-3013-7","10.1109/AAIAC60008.2023.10465309","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10465309","Natural Language Processing;Aflatoxin knowledge;Chatbot;Dataset;Artificial Intelligence","Crops;Oral communication;Data collection;Chatbots;Regulation;Stakeholders;Feeds","","","","47","IEEE","19 Mar 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this regard, early work mainly considers a single community while recent studies are starting to profile developers with cross-community data. However, few works consider the collaborative interactions among developers in evaluating developer expertise across communities. In this work, we propose a collaboration-aware approach to profiling developer expertise using cross-community data by taking into consideration developers’ contributions, collaborative interactions, and the dynamic changes of expertise. Specifically, we are concerned with the common developers in GitHub and Stack Overflow. First, we propose a time-sensitive model to characterize the developer’s expertise in the two communities and integrate the results to generate basic expertise profiles. Second, we build a developer network by analyzing the collaborative interactions among the developers of the two communities. Finally, we apply the topic-sensitive PageRank algorithm to incorporate developer relationships into expertise profiling.

Compared to existing approaches using linters, our findings suggest that NCC is capable of detecting a larger number of errors per snippet and more error types, and it is more efficient at fixing snippets. We find that 73.7% of the code snippets in NPM documentation have errors; with the use of NCC’s corrections, this number was reduced to 25.1%.

In this work, we aim to help developers who want to quickly capture the key points of several answer posts relevant to a technical question before they read the details of the posts. We formulate our task as a query-focused multi-answer-posts summarization task for a given technical question. Our proposed approach AnswerBot contains three main steps : 1) relevant question retrieval, 2) useful answer paragraph selection, 3) diverse answer summary generation. To evaluate our approach, we build a repository of 228,817 Java questions and their corresponding answers from Stack Overflow. We conduct user studies with 100 randomly selected Java questions (not in the question repository) to evaluate the quality of the answer summaries generated by our approach, and the effectiveness of its relevant question retrieval and answer paragraph selection components.

Researchers have speculated that appification promotes security problems, as it increasingly allows inexperienced laymen to develop complex and sensitive apps. Anecdotally, Internet resources such as Stack Overflow are blamed for promoting insecure solutions that are naively copy-pasted by inexperienced developers. In this paper, we for the first time systematically analyzed how the use of information resources impacts code security. We first surveyed 295 app developers who have published in the Google Play market concerning how they use resources to solve security-related problems. Based on the survey results, we conducted a lab study with 54 Android developers (students and professionals), in which participants wrote security-and privacy-relevant code under time constraints. The participants were assigned to one of four conditions: free choice of resources, Stack Overflow only, official Android documentation only, or books only. Those participants who were allowed to use only Stack Overflow produced significantly less secure code than those using, the official Android documentation or books, while participants using the official Android documentation produced significantly less functional code than those using Stack Overflow. To assess the quality of Stack Overflow as a resource, we surveyed the 139 threads our participants accessed during the study, finding that only 25% of them were helpful in solving the assigned tasks and only 17% of them contained secure code snippets. In order to obtain ground truth concerning the prevalence of the secure and insecure code our participants wrote in the lab study, we statically analyzed a random sample of 200,000 apps from Google Play, finding that 93.6% of the apps used at least one of the API calls our participants used during our study. We also found that many of the security errors made by our participants also appear in the wild, possibly also originating in the use of Stack Overflow to solve programming problems. Taken together, our results confirm that API documentation is secure but hard to use, while informal documentation such as Stack Overflow is more accessible but often leads to insecurity. Given time constraints and economic pressures, we can expect that Android developers will continue to choose those resources that are easiest to use, therefore, our results firmly establish the need for secure-but-usable documentation.","2375-1207","978-1-5090-0824-7","10.1109/SP.2016.25","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7546508","security;usability;Android;developer resources;developer study","Androids;Humanoid robots;Security;Documentation;Mobile communication;Programming;Privacy","","141","","46","IEEE","18 Aug 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To address the limitation of the search engine of Stack Overflow, we propose RFEB which is an integrated and iterative approach that considers both relevance and popularity of Stack Overflow questions to identify FEBugs. To evaluate the performance of RFEB, we perform experiments on a dataset from Stack Overflow which contains more than ten million posts.

In biodiversity monitoring, crowdsourcing is a promising approach as it benefits from a large group of people with an often underestimated biodiversity and taxonomy knowledge. Despite its huge potential, crowdsourcing approaches are still underrepresented in biodiversity monitoring. We here evaluate a participatory crowdsourcing web mapping platform that was developed to get information about geographic locations and biodiversity characteristics of urban ponds in the Geneva cross-border region. An important fraction of urban ponds is assumed to be located on private grounds, which makes the participatory crowdsourcing approach very valuable. A media campaign was initiated, encouraging citizens participate and to digitize ponds. In this paper we a) evaluate and discuss the impact of the media campaign on the usage behaviour and history of citizens using the crowdsourcing platform and b) assess the quality of the digitized data that has been collected. This study shows that through media campaigns, citizens can be mobilized and motivated to participate in biodiversity crowdsourcing projects. Results indicate that large quantities of users were recruited through social media. However, only a small fraction of about 3% of the mobilized people digitized ponds on the platform. The majority of these users (68%) digitized one pond while 32% digitized two or more ponds. This study shows that it is important for crowdsourcing platforms to be designed and planned in order to facilitate its usage. However, it is crucial for the success of such cam­paigns to offer something in return to the users and to encourage them to interact among themselves. We suggest that future crowdsourcing biodiversity mapping campaigns should have mobile-optimized interfaces. Mobile devices have the potential to e. g. automatically register coordinates for biodiversity sighting and for uploading respective pictures directly in the field.","","978-989-758-142-7","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7512231","Citizen Science;Crowdsourcing;Participatory WebGIS;Social Media;Urban Biodiversity;VGI","Biodiversity;Crowdsourcing;Media;Urban areas;Databases;Web pages","","1","","10","","14 Jul 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Yet, they are typically one-sentence principles without detailed specifications, e.g., “Properly free allocated memory upon the completion of functions and at all exit points.”, which makes them difficult to follow in practice, especially for software developers who are not yet experienced in secure programming. To address this problem, this paper proposes SCPatcher, an automated approach to enrich secure coding practices by mining crowd security discussions on online knowledge-sharing platforms, such as Stack Overflow. In particular, for each security post, SCPatcher first extracts the area of coding examples and coding explanations with a fix-prompt tuned Large Language Model (LLM) via Prompt Learning. Then, it hierarchically slices the lengthy code into coding examples and summarizes the coding explanations with the areas. Finally, SCPatcher matches the CWE and Public SCP, integrating them with extracted coding examples and explanations to form the SCP specifications, which are the wild SCPs with details, proposed by the developers. To evaluate the performance of SCPatcher, we conduct experiments on 3,907 security posts from Stack Overflow. The experimental results show that SCPatcher outperforms all baselines in extracting the coding examples with 2.73 % MLine on average, as well as coding explanations with 3.97 % F1 on average. Moreover, we apply SCPatcher on 447 new security posts to further evaluate its practicality, and the extracted SCP specifications enrich the public SCPs with 3,074 lines of code and 1,967 sentences.","2643-1572","979-8-3503-2996-4","10.1109/ASE56229.2023.00040","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62272445,62232016,62072442); Youth Innovation Promotion Association Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Queensland NSRSG(grant numbers:NS-2201); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10298463","Software Security;Secure Coding Practice;Artificial Intelligence;Large Language Model","Codes;Programming;Encoding;Software;Security;Data mining;Software engineering","","","","59","IEEE","8 Nov 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This leads to different efforts to seamlessly integrate microblogging into the daily-used tools. Specifically, microblogging is being regarded as particularly useful during software development, akin to the tradition of Q&A forums. This paper looks at a particular kind of software: the one being developed by domain experts through the use of Domain Specific Languages (DSLs). We believe this setting is specially amenable to benefit from Q&A microblogging due to inherent limitations of the target audience. This brings the twist of domain specific ness into microblogging, i.e. the Q&A process is now framed by the semantics of the DSL constructs. This permits the introduction of editing assistants that embed domain knowledge about the kind of questions that can be posed, and the way answers can be selected. This opens an opportunity for more focused and assisted microblogging. This paper introduces Crowd Call, an in place microblogging mediator for DSL editors. The aim is to make microblogging a natural gesture during the conception of the DSL expressions, making transparent the interplay between the DSL editor and the Social Networking Services. In addition, Crowd Call can be configured to the constructs and resolution strategies of the DSL at hand so that questions and answers are framed by the semantics of the DSL. The approach is illustrated for three DSLs: the Google Spreadsheets formula language, SQL and Sticklet. We show how Crowd Call-mediated microblogging is tuned for the semantics of each DSL.","","978-0-7695-5114-2","10.1109/CGC.2013.42","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6686034","Microblogging;Domain Specific Languages;Social Networking Services","DSL;Google;Semantics;Software;Social network services;Communities;Computer languages","","","","24","IEEE","19 Dec 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Nevertheless, this method has considerably been dependent on the syntactic information extracted through morphological analysis. Moreover, this method has a vital downside of requiring numerous explanatory variables and complicated multiple regression equation to estimate factor scores. Therefore, the principle has been shifted to applying N-gram over morphological analysis. In this paper, 5-gram is applied to the feature values, in a similar way as the previous analysis using shorter N-grams. Further analysis has shown that 5-gram would be also applicable to the method. In terms of estimation accuracy, N-grams also outscore morphological analysis; above all 2-gram and 3-gram show the best accuracy. Hence, it could be suggested that N-gram should play more important role in estimating factor scores than mere morphological analysis.","2472-0070","979-8-3503-2422-8","10.1109/IIAI-AAI59060.2023.00024","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10371593","Q&A Site;Factor Score;Multiple Regression Analysis;N-gram","Estimation;Syntactics;Feature extraction;Regression analysis;Data mining;Informatics","","5","","11","IEEE","29 Dec 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Finally, required accuracy is determined by services that use posting behavior; therefore, we need another method, which can be combined with our proposed method for analyzing user behavior using the HTTP body. So far, we assume behavioral targeting advertising (BTA) and Q&A sites as services using posting behavior. Our proposed method might be used for these services.

LPS splits the network into task-specific partitions via an ADMM-based pruning strategy. This leads to no forgetting, while maintaining parsimony. Moreover, LPS integrates a novel selective knowledge sharing scheme into this ADMM optimization framework. This enables adaptive knowledge sharing in an end-to-end fashion. Comprehensive experimental results on two lifelong learning benchmark datasets and a challenging real world radio frequency fingerprinting dataset are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

In community live chatting, developers are likely to post issues they encountered (e.g., setup issues and compile issues), and other developers respond with possible solutions. Therefore, community live chats contain rich sets of information for reported issues and their corresponding solutions, which can be quite useful for knowledge sharing and future reuse if extracted and restored in time. However, it remains challenging to accurately mine such knowledge due to the noisy nature of interleaved dialogs in live chat data. In this paper, we first formulate the problem of issue-solution pair extraction from developer live chat data, and propose an automated approach, named ISPY, based on natural language processing and deep learning techniques with customized enhancements, to address the problem. Specifically, ISPY automates three tasks: 1) Disentangle live chat logs, employing a feedforward neural network to disentangle a conversation history into separate dialogs automatically; 2) Detect dialogs discussing issues, using a novel convolutional neural network (CNN), which consists of a BERT-based utterance embedding layer, a context-aware dialog embedding layer, and an output layer; 3) Extract appropriate utterances and combine them as corresponding solutions, based on the same CNN structure but with different feeding inputs. To evaluate ISPY, we compare it with six baselines, utilizing a dataset with 750 dialogs including 171 issue-solution pairs and evaluate ISPY from eight open source communities. The results show that, for issue-detection, our approach achieves the F1 of 76%, and outperforms all baselines by 30%. Our approach achieves the F1 of 63% for solution-extraction and outperforms the baselines by 20%. Furthermore, we apply ISPY on three new communities to extensively evaluate ISPY’s practical usage. Moreover, we publish over 30K issue-solution pairs extracted from 11 communities. We believe that ISPY can facilitate community-based software development by promoting knowledge sharing and shortening the issue-resolving process.","2643-1572","978-1-6654-0337-5","10.1109/ASE51524.2021.9678894","National Key Research and Development Program of China; National Science Foundation; Chinese Academy of Sciences; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9678894","","Deep learning;Software;Natural language processing;Feedforward neural networks;Convolutional neural networks;Data mining;Noise measurement","","8","","70","IEEE","20 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

TCM posits that both individual creativity and shared mental models (SMMs) contribute to team creativity. SMMs act as a mediator between knowledge sharing and team creativity. Antecedents to individual creativity include an individual's propensity to be creative and individual knowledge. Individual knowledge also is an antecedent to knowledge sharing, as are an individual's propensity to share knowledge and trust within the team. In an exploratory study at a telecom company, a team of design experts participating in four creative sessions provided initial support for the TCM constructs and their relationships. The findings suggest that further exploratory and empirical research on TCM is justified. Some tentative implications for research and practice are presented.","1530-1605","978-0-7695-4525-7","10.1109/HICSS.2012.66","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6148635","","Telecommunications;Cellular phones;Collaboration;Team working;Companies;Technological innovation","","7","","71","IEEE","9 Feb 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In order to validate this framework, a case study was conducted to demonstrate the analysis processes and results. Data of pair-wise comparison for fuzzy AHP were collected by questionnaires. The results indicate that community of practice possesses highest priority, the next is e-learning community, and the lowest is ordinary forum.

But inappropriate use of risk assessment and decision making processes can still affect task completion during a project. New management methodologies must therefore be developed that enhance knowledge sharing by considering the viewpoints of more experts, supporting ad-hoc communications between partners and improving secured integration of technologies. Not only could time management become more efficient because the managers would have a broader, deeper understanding of the decisional context, but it could also minimise investment risks by enabling fast reactivity to any unforeseen issues. Based on the above requirements, the pro-active project management is introduced here as a solution to current project management limitations. It makes full use of advanced technologies, such as virtual reality, to enable knowledge sharing at any time between any members of a project. After an analysis of current issues, this paper thus introduces the pro-active project management methodologies and the technologies that enable its implementation.
