The crowdsourcing technology can be viewed as ""Human Cloud"" technique, in contrast to ""Machine Cloud Computing"". Using a crowd with a large number of internationally widespread workers and the flexibility of micro-payment services, crowdsourcing platforms like Amazon's MTurk and Microworkers can outsource traditional forms of work organization on a microscopic level of granularity to a large, anonymous crowd of workers, the human cloud. In such platforms work or tasks are organized at a finer granularity and jobs are split into micro-tasks that need to be performed by a human cloud. It is a need of analysis to understand the anatomy of such a platform and of models to describe the time-dependent growth of the human cloud, in order to predict the traffic impact of such novel applications and to forecast the growth dynamics. The purpose of this paper is a measurement-based statistical analysis of a crowdsourcing platform, using the Microworkers.com platform as example. The obtained results are then used to model the growth of such fast-changing environments in the Internet using well-known models from biology. Based on the findings from the population growth, we develop a deterministic fluid model which is an extension of the SIR model of epidemics, in order to investigate the platform dynamics.","","978-0-9836283-0-9","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6038475","","Biological system modeling;Humans;Logistics;Cloud computing;Organizations;Conferences","","6","","13","","10 Oct 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Recent developments show that the idea gains additional momentum. However, an obstacle for widespread adoption is the lack of an integrated way to execute business processes based on a crowdsourcing platform. The main difference compared to traditional approaches in business process execution is that tasks or activities cannot be directly assigned but are posted to the crowdsourcing platform, while people can choose deliberately which tasks to book and work on. In this paper we propose a framework for adaptive execution of business processes on top of a crowdsourcing platform. Based on historical data gathered by the platform we mine the booking behavior of people based on the nature and incentive of the crowdsourced tasks. Using the learned behavior model we derive an incentive management approach based on mathematical optimization that executes business processes in a cost-optimal way considering their deadlines. We evaluate our approach through simulations to prove the feasibility and effectiveness. The experiments verify our assumptions regarding the necessary ingredients of the approach and show the advantage of taking the booking behavior into account compared to the case when it is partially of fully neglected.","","978-1-4673-2740-4","10.4108/icst.collaboratecom.2012.250434","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6450935","Human-centric BPM;Crowdsourcing;Incentive Management;Adaptive Process Execution","Books;Mathematical model;Business;Irrigation","","5","","21","","7 Feb 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we consider the complementarity among different types of tasks, which means the cost of a worker to complete a task combination is less than the sum of the costs that the worker completes each task in the combination separately. In the crowdsourcing, task assignment is one of the most essential problems, we formulate the crowdsourcing task assignment as a many-to-many matching problem. However, most existing works ignore the preferences of crowdsourcers and workers. Since both of workers and crowdsourcers are selfish individuals who are not necessarily aligned with the system optimization. They can violate the task assignment to obtain a higher utility. Different from the traditional task assignment mechanisms which focus on social welfare maximization, we not only consider the preferences of crowdsourcers and workers, but also obtain a stable matching result for the many-to-many matching problem. Payment determination is also a essential problem in the crowdsourcing system, so we compute the corresponding payment profiles for both crowdsourcers and workers. Extensive simulations have been performed, and the result demonstrates that our proposed mechanism not only obtains a stable matching but also has a high individual utility for each worker and each crowdsourcer. Workers and crowdsourcers would comply with the allocation results.","","978-1-7281-2058-4","10.1109/HPCC/SmartCity/DSS.2019.00263","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8855504","Crowdsourcing, complementarity, stable matching","Task analysis;Crowdsourcing;Conferences;Roads;Analytical models;Stability analysis;High performance computing","","4","","11","IEEE","3 Oct 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This work investigates the relationship between the intra-rater reliability and the user performance in the context of a speech quality assessment task. To this end, a crowdsourcing study has been conducted in which users were requested to rate speech stimuli with respect to their overall quality. Ratings were collected on a 5-point scale in accordance with the ITU-T Rec. P.808. The speech stimuli were taken from the database ITU-T Rec.

Furthermore, a model as a function of intra-rater reliability, root-mean-squared-deviation between the listeners ratings and age, has been built to predict the listener performance. Such a model is intended to provide a measure of how valid the crowdsourcing results are, when there is no laboratory results to compare to.","2472-7814","978-1-5386-8212-8","10.1109/QoMEX.2019.8743148","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8743148","speech quality assessment;crowdsourcing;intra-rater reliability","","","4","","31","IEEE","24 Jun 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Accountability in crowdsourcing services enables participants to work honestly and improves the quality of services. The realization of accountability requires trusted evidence, multiparty verification, and fair reward or punishment. Blockchain technology, which is inherently tamper-resistant, traceable, and decentralized, puts forward a direction for realizing the requirements. However, in the process of data management and decentralized verification, it is hard to achieve a better trade-off between efficiency and security. This paper proposes a blockchain-based verification scheme integrated by trust management, ‘validatorRep’, that is suitable to enhance accountability in the crowdsourcing system. In detail, a decoupled blockchain model is proposed for the differentiated storage of business transactions and log transactions during data interaction. Additionally, a fine-grained trust model is proposed, including both the rep-utation of participants and the trust relationship between participants. Based on fine-grained trust, the decentralized verification scheme is designed to guarantee secure data access, trusted verification, and fair reward or punishment. Finally, the proposed framework is deployed on the Ethereum platform to observe its effectiveness and overall performance. Simulation results also reveal that the proposed fine-grained trust model can provide efficient accountability for crowdsourcing.","0730-3157","978-1-6654-8810-5","10.1109/COMPSAC54236.2022.00121","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9842709","Accountability;Crowdsourcing;Blockchain;Trust management;Verification","Crowdsourcing;Industries;Simulation;Quality of service;Throughput;Data models;Software","","4","","27","IEEE","10 Aug 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Therefore, this paper proposes a reverse pricing mechanism based on VCG and quality all-pay for collaborative crowdsourcing (VCG-QCP). The actual crowdsourcing scenario is considered with VCG mechanism, and the concept of quality all-pay is introduced to evaluate the work quality of workers who might perform the task. Then a general reverse pricing model is established by mathematical modeling, and the pricing algorithm is designed based on this model.

Due to diverse factors (i.e., task difficulty, worker capability, and incentives), the collected answers from various crowd workers are of different quality. Many approaches have been proposed to manage high quality answers and to reduce the budget by modelling tasks, workers, or both. However, most of the existing approaches implicitly assume that the capability of workers is fixed during the crowdsourcing process. But in practice, such capability can be improved by gradually completing easy to hard tasks, alike human beings’ intrinsic self-paced learning ability. In this paper, we investigate crowdsourcing with self-paced workers, whose capability can be gradually boosted as he/she scrutinises and completes easy to hard tasks. Our proposed SPCrowd (Self-Paced Crowd worker) first asks workers to complete a set of golden tasks with known annotations; provides feedback to assist workers with capturing the raw modes of tasks and to spark the self-paced learning, which in turn facilitates the estimation of workers’ quality and tasks’ difficulty. It then introduces a task difficulty model to quantify the difficulty of tasks and rank them from easy to hard, and a benefit maximization criterion for task assignment, which can dynamically monitor the quality of self-paced workers and assign the sorted tasks to capable workers. In this way, a worker can successfully complete hard tasks after he/she completes easier and related tasks. Experimental results on semi-simulated and real crowdsourcing projects show that SPCrowd can better control the quality and save the budget compared to competitive baselines.","2374-8486","978-1-6654-2398-4","10.1109/ICDM51629.2021.00038","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9679043","Crowdsourcing;Self-paced learning;Quality control;Task assignment;Truth inference","Crowdsourcing;Costs;Uncertainty;Annotations;Human intelligence;Estimation;Sparks","","2","","36","IEEE","24 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

More and more crowdsourcing platforms allocate tasks over the social network due to its pervasiveness. Although most research focuses on direct contribution-based task allocation with some budget constraints, a robust task allocation scheme should also consider the task allocation in the word-of-mouth (WoM) mode, in which tasks are delivered from workers to workers. In this paper, we discuss an NP-Complete problem, cost-effective and budget-balanced task allocation (CBTA) problem, specially for the WoM mode crowdsourcing over social network, which aims to minimize the overall budget consumption as well as balance the budgets among target social groups. Furthermore, we propose two heuristic algorithms CB-greedy and CB-local based on greedy strategy and local search technique respectively to construct a spanning tree for task allocation. We prove that the running time of CB-greedy is O(m2 log m) while CB-local utilizing disjoint-set achieves O(mna(m, n)), where m is the number of edges indicating interactions of social groups, n is the number of social groups, and α is the inverse Ackerman function. Extensive simulations show that the proposed algorithms guarantee the criteria to a large extent. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first work jointly optimizing cost effectiveness and budget balance in the WoM mode crowdsourcing systems.","2374-9628","978-1-5090-6468-7","10.1109/PCCC.2017.8280461","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8280461","","Task analysis;Crowdsourcing;Resource management;Social groups;Social network services;Silicon;Heuristic algorithms","","2","","24","IEEE","5 Feb 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

ClusterUCBscRec adopts the ""explore & exploit"" strategy to improve the recommending performance continuously, and therefore goes quickly through the cold-start stage. Besides the project models, developer models built from multiple aspects, including developer profile, preferences and skills are introduced into recommendation. Developers and projects are clustered to speed up training and recommending processes to further improve the performance.We have evaluated ClusterUCBscRec on Jointforce.

However, due to the workflows presenting a tree-like structure, the reliability of the current social crowdsourcing system is poor. The absence of a relay worker will cause disconnection between the job owner and sub-workers. For increasing the reliability, we explore two special social structures. One is based on a triangle relation among any three consecutive workers on the workflows; the other one is based on a quadrilateral relation between two physically intersected workflows.

Sometimes, we have no other option, than to utilize crowdsourcing, to acquire the data in necessary quantity. Crowdsourcing is a costly endeavor, always with space for improvements in task solving quantity and quality. Studies show that consideration of implicit feedback (behavior of workers during task solving) helps to improve the overall crowd output. Gaze-tracking is a powerful source of implicit feedback as it records user's activity outside typical feedback channels (e.g. clicking, scrolling, typing) and reveals a great deal of person's cognitive processes. This paper argues that gaze-tracking represents a potent feedback source even for crowdsourcing, as gaze-tracking technology becomes available for wider worker pools. The paper also presents an example case study demonstrating the use of the gaze-tracking during a typical crowdsourcing task - acquisition of training dataset for automated word sense disambiguation. Normally in such task, the worker explicitly selects a corresponding sense for a given word located in a text snippet and thus contributes to the dataset. With gaze-tracking involved, worker also shares us other information useful for dataset enrichment: worker's reading pattern (which may indicate confidence) and important sense-distinguishing words (e.g. contextual words that trigger worker's decisions).","","978-1-4673-8395-0","10.1109/SMAP.2015.7370084","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7370084","","Crowdsourcing;Training;Software;Gaze tracking;Hardware;Data visualization;Informatics","","2","","19","IEEE","4 Jan 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The validity of the data collected in a disturbed environment is questionable, especially in speech quality assessment and other audio-related tasks. This work investigates the applicability of different ensemble-based and non-linear models to correct the bias found in speech quality ratings given to a German speech dataset in noisy crowdsourcing environments. Such a model would help to avoid throwing away quality scores that could be used. The model was trained with data collected in a speech quality assessment study conducted in a simulated crowdsourcing environment in the laboratory. Two groups of listeners rated the quality of speech stimuli in the presence of environmental noise at different levels. The noise under test was street traffic, and the levels ranged from 36dBA to 65. 5dBA.

However, previous works only mention this discovery textually, rather than quantifying their models’ psychological factors. To fill this blank, we utilize the psychological game theory to analyze the crowdsourcing process. With mathematical ways, we first show that the requestor could reduce the cost of compensation via psychology methods, substituting partial monetary rewards with psychological payoffs. Furthermore, when workers are reciprocal and risk-neutral about expected earnings, we prove that the related incentive plan is requestor’s optimal choice. In particular, we find the workers’ psychological payoffs and requestor’s cost in equilibrium. Finally, we conduct a simulation to illustrate our findings intuitively. Therefore, our unique psychological crowdsourcing model provides a promising detour for incentive mechanism design in crowdsourcing scenarios.","1938-1883","978-1-5386-8347-7","10.1109/ICC45855.2022.9838632","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9838632","Crowdsourcing;Psychological Game Theory;Reciprocity;Incentive Mechanism Design","Crowdsourcing;Costs;Statistical analysis;Psychology;Games;Mathematical models;Blockchains","","1","","13","IEEE","11 Aug 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Most recent literature studied the location privacy of users during task allocation in mobile crowdsourcing. But in some cases, a dispute may occur when users have an argument about the payment of the task. To adjudicate the dispute, users need to provide their private information such as credentials to the third party. Furthermore, finding a trusted third party for mobile crowdsourcing is hard in real life, raising the opportunity for decentralized disputes. However, existing work cannot avoid information leakage during decentralized dispute adjudication, and these schemes can also lower the efficiency of arbitrating. In this paper, we propose a privacy-preserving and decentralized dispute arbitration protocol, which allows the dispute adjudication to proceed without a trusted third party but prevents users' private information from disclosing. Specifically, we first propose a secure task allocation protocol for mobile crowdsourcing, which preserves users' location privacy while enabling efficient task release and allocation. Then, in order to avoid employing a trusted third party, we design a privacy-preserving and decentralized dispute arbitration protocol, which does not reveal any private information during the dispute adjudication. Security and privacy discussions show our protocol can resist forgery attacks but preserve privacy during the decentralized dispute adjudication.

Many excellent designs of decentralized crowdsourcing platforms (DCSPs) built atop blockchain have been proposed recently. Benefiting from blockchain, DCSPs can provide fascinating features, like tampering resistance and anonymity. However, new security issues keep cropping up. While existing studies have proved that DCSPs are vulnerable to various attacks, our study has identified a new attack named solution probing attack against DCSPs. The adversary of solution probing attack can take advantage of the anonymity of DCSPs to probe valid solutions using a generative model. Due to the transparency of blockchain transactions, our probing attack is effective even if the solutions are encrypted. We evaluate the probing attack on large-scale crowdsourcing tasks. Experimental results show that the adversary is capable of rewarding fraud without any meaningful contribution to the crowdsourcing task.

Recently, however, more complex tasks have been attempted including asking crowdsource workers to assign continuous labels, or predictions. In essence, this involves the use of crowdsourcing for function estimation. We are motivated by this problem to drive applications such as collaborative prediction, that is, harnessing the wisdom of the crowd to predict quantities more accurately. To do so, we propose a Bayesian approach aimed specifically at alleviating overfitting, a typical impediment to accurate prediction models in practice. In particular, we develop a variational Bayesian technique for two different worker noise models - one that assumes workers' noises are independent and the other that assumes workers' noises have a latent low-rank structure.

For this reason, it is common to delegate solutions design to external parties. One viable solution is Crowdsourcing, where the duty is moved to a wide audience of experts interested in working on enterprises' development problems in exchange for a monetary reward. Currently, various platforms for crowdsourcing software development are available, but they come with some important limitations: (1) a proprietary and not transparent platform needs to be run by a third trustable party; (2) the cost of publishing a task in the platform can be not affordable for many companies, making the crowdsourcing process economically inefficient; (3) once a solution has been provided by the “crowd”, the task is closed and no further improved solutions are accepted. To overcome these issues and provide further features, in this paper we propose our blockchain-based platform for Crowdsourcing Machine Learning models design and training, with an incentive for the “crowd” to keep on looking for solutions capable of improving the current state of the art. After analyzing and comparing various blockchain-based platforms similar to the one hereby presented, our solution architecture is described in detail, three use case scenarios are presented, and future improvements are discussed.","2835-3498","979-8-3503-3535-4","10.1109/DAPPS57946.2023.00014","European Union(grant numbers:864537); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10237013","Crowdsourcing;Machine Learning;Blockchain;dApps;Distributed Storage","Crowdsourcing;Training;Solution design;Publishing;Biological system modeling;Machine learning;Companies","","","","32","IEEE","6 Sep 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

They all overlooked the stronger threats from the malicious crowdsourcing platform (e.g., may return incorrectly estimated truths) and many critical issues inherited from centralization. This paper proposes a blockchain-based decentralized truth discovery scheme for crowdsourcing, with computation integrity guarantees against malicious participants and support for efficient processing of generic streaming data. We adopt the idea of hybrid storage and computations to ease the expensive on-chain cost. Workers are grouped for off-chain partial truth estimation and smart contracts are leveraged for on-chain final truth aggregation. To prevent any improper computations from malicious entities, we record the hashes of data and worker weights on-chain occasionally. Through theoretical analysis and extensive experiments over real-world and synthetic datasets implemented in Ethereum, we demonstrate that our scheme 1) achieves our reliability goals with certain privacy assurance; 2) exhibits a higher truth estimation accuracy than existing approaches and a lower gas consumption than the baseline.","2155-5494","979-8-3503-0052-9","10.1109/SECON58729.2023.10287465","National Natural Science Foundation of China; Ministry of Education; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10287465","Truth discovery;crowdsourcing;blockchain;data stream;reliability","Crowdsourcing;Data privacy;Costs;Smart contracts;Estimation;Reliability theory;Sensors","","","","28","IEEE","23 Oct 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, open permissionless blockchain platforms typically disclose all transaction data on public ledgers, which compromises the privacy and anonymity of workers and encourages free-riding. Blockchain-based anonymous crowdsourcing systems have recently emerged, offering anonymity but requiring identity registration for workers and a trusted setup for key generation. These systems in general, fail to support anonymous payments, potentially compromising worker identities. In this paper, we integrate anonymous payments into crowdsourcing, eliminating the need for identity registration and trusted setup, thus fostering open and anonymous participation from any worker. Our solution utilizes the decentralized anonymous payment system framework, such as Zerocoin, and includes staking mechanisms for participation in crowdsourcing as well as efficient one-out-of-many zero-knowledge proofs.

In this paper, we propose a privacy-aware verifiable crowdsourcing quality assessment scheme UNITE against semi-honest and malicious adversaries. UNITE explores federated learning for privacy-aware training of task models, which serves as an indicator of quality assessment. To prevent attackers from deducing the task data from model gradients, we design a secure model update protocol based on differential privacy and perform it with blockchain smart contracts for trustworthy model aggregation. In the presence of malicious requesters providing incorrect assessments, we exploit Pedersen Commitment to generate evidence, which is recorded on-chain with some metadata for public audit. Detailed privacy analysis demonstrates that our differential privacy scheme satisfies (ε,δ)-local differential privacy.

Private data includes anything confidential and sensitive in nature to the user and can range from the user's identity and location to the address of the person. Data should be safeguarded in a way that prevents any unauthorized person from breaking the security mechanisms protecting the data and accessing the private information. This paper presents a hybrid approach to deal with the privacy challenges by creating a security layer which uses a combination of techniques namely encryption, encoding, obfuscation and anonymization to better protect users' privacy in crowdsourcing applications. Moreover, the security mechanism allows the user, instead of the application developer, to choose the desired privacy level. A prototype application has been developed to demonstrate the use of the hybrid security layer and, based on the results obtained, it can be deduced that the proposed hybrid mechanism meets the privacy requirements defined in this paper, thereby effectively protecting the privacy of the users in crowdsourcing applications.","","978-1-5386-0514-1","10.1109/ICTUS.2017.8286093","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8286093","Participatory Sensing;Crowdsourcing;Privacy;Encryption;Obfuscation;Encoding;Hashing;Anonymization","Privacy;Crowdsourcing;Sensors;Encryption;Access control","","","","20","IEEE","8 Feb 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In the task allocation phase, we propose a Stackelberg game based mechanism for the SC platform to efficiently allocate spatial tasks and wireless charging power to each worker. In the data crowdsourcing phase, the workers may have an incentive to misreport its real working location to improve its own utility, which manipulates the SC platform.

Nevertheless, the crowdsourcing process may involve sensitive identity information, and identity protection remains unresolved during stages such as data submission and correct payment. Especially, when workers invoke a smart contract to submit data, it inevitably exposes their identities. Identity disclosure significantly impacts the credibility of crowdsourcing platforms. Existing solutions suggest solving the problem through anonymous token contracts such as Zether. However, tokens can easily result in fund freezing or extra information leakage. Moreover, invoking the contract to submit data will still disclose workers' blockchain accounts. To tackle the identity protection issue, in this paper, we propose AcCrowd which achieves worker anonymity and payment correctness in crowdsourcing systems atop blockchain. We first design a verifiable proxy submission mechanism for data submission, enabling workers to invoke contracts without disclosing their accounts. Then, we introduce and improve the BlockMaze architecture to replace previous anonymous token-based methods, enhancing privacy and flexibility. Besides, we designed a revealed payment mechanism that utilizes an adaptor signature to bind data reveal and reward payment together, simultaneously protecting the requester and worker. Our security and performance evaluations demonstrate the security and practicability of AcCrowd.","2576-6813","979-8-3503-1090-0","10.1109/GLOBECOM54140.2023.10437088","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10437088","Blockchain;crowdsourcing;anonymous pay-ment;smart contract;privacy-preserving","Crowdsourcing;Performance evaluation;Privacy;Smart contracts;Information leakage;Blockchains;Reliability","","","","14","IEEE","26 Feb 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, creating these models require parallel data between natural language (NL) and code with fine-grained alignments. StackOverflow (SO) is a promising source to create such a data set: the questions are diverse and most of them have corresponding answers with high-quality code snippets. However, existing heuristic methods (e.g. pairing the title of a post with the code in the accepted answer) are limited both in their coverage and the correctness of the NL-code pairs obtained. In this paper, we propose a novel method to mine high-quality aligned data from SO using two sets of features: hand-crafted features considering the structure of the extracted snippets, and correspondence features obtained by training a probabilistic model to capture the correlation between NL and code using neural networks. These features are fed into a classifier that determines the quality of mined NL-code pairs. Experiments using Python and Java as test beds show that the proposed method greatly expands coverage and accuracy over existing mining methods, even when using only a small number of labeled examples. Further, we find that reasonable results are achieved even when training the classifier on one language and testing on another, showing promise for scaling NL-code mining to a wide variety of programming languages beyond those for which we are able to annotate data.","2574-3864","978-1-4503-5716-6","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8595231","Code Mining;Stack Overflow;Neural Networks","Data mining;Python;Feature extraction;Java;Natural languages;Training","","14","","48","","30 Dec 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Ideally, SO users could benefit from highlighted navigational cues that help them decide if an answer is relevant to their task and context. Such navigational cues could be in the form of essential sentences that help the searcher decide whether they want to read the answer or skip over it. In this paper, we compare four potential approaches for identifying essential sentences. We adopt two existing approaches and develop two new approaches based on the idea that contextual information in a sentence (e.g., “if using windows”) could help identify essential sentences. We compare the four techniques using a survey of 43 participants. Our participants indicate that it is not always easy to figure out what the best solution for their specific problem is, given the options, and that they would indeed like to easily spot contextual information that may narrow down the search. Our quantitative comparison of the techniques shows that there is no single technique sufficient for identifying essential sentences that can serve as navigational cues, while our qualitative analysis shows that participants valued explanations and specific conditions, and did not value filler sentences or speculations. Our work sheds light on the importance of navigational cues, and our findings can be used to guide future research to find the best combination of techniques to identify such cues.","1534-5351","978-1-7281-5143-4","10.1109/SANER48275.2020.9054828","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9054828","","Codes;Navigation;Conferences;Search problems;Software;Task analysis","","18","","38","IEEE","2 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Despite the efforts of its designers, APIs may suffer from a number of issues (such as incomplete or erroneous documentation, poor performance, and backward incompatibility). To maintain a healthy client base, API designers must learn these issues to fix them. Question answering sites, such as Stack Overflow (SO), has become a popular place for discussing API issues. These posts about API issues are invaluable to API designers, not only because they can help to learn more about the problem but also because they can facilitate learning the requirements of API users. However, the unstructured nature of posts and the abundance of non-issue posts make the task of detecting SO posts concerning API issues difficult and challenging. In this paper, we first develop a supervised learning approach using a Conditional Random Field (CRF), a statistical modeling method, to identify API issue-related sentences. We use the above information together with different features of posts and experience of users to build a technique, called CAPS, that can classify SO posts concerning API issues. Evaluation of CAPS using carefully curated SO posts on three popular API types reveals that the technique outperforms all three baseline approaches we consider in this study. We also conduct studies to test the generalizability of CAPS results and to understand the effects of different sources of information on it.","","978-1-5386-4969-5","10.1109/SANER.2018.8330213","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8330213","API Issue;unstructured data mining;text classification;feature extraction;Stack Overflow","Androids;Humanoid robots;Task analysis;Documentation;Usability;Knowledge discovery;Supervised learning","","17","","36","IEEE","5 Apr 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To be able to analyze how content on SO evolves, we built SOTorrent, an open dataset based on the official SO data dump. SOTorrent provides access to the version history of SO content at the level of whole posts and individual text or code blocks. It connects SO posts to other platforms by aggregating URLs from text blocks and by collecting references from GitHub files to SO posts. In this paper, we describe how we built SOTorrent, and in particular how we evaluated 134 different string similarity metrics regarding their applicability for reconstructing the version history of text and code blocks. Based on a first analysis using the dataset, we present insights into the evolution of SO posts, e.g., that post edits are usually small, happen soon after the initial creation of the post, and that code is rarely changed without also updating the surrounding text. Further, our analysis revealed a close relationship between post edits and comments.

The objective of this study is to determine the various pain-points developers face when implementing systems that rely on the most mature of these intelligent services, specifically those that provide computer vision. We use Stack Overflow to mine indications of the frustrations that developers appear to face when using computer vision services, classifying their questions against two recent classification taxonomies (documentation-related and general questions).

Furthermore, about 18% of the accepted answers (i.e., verified solutions) also do not score the maximum votes. All these counter-intuitive findings cast doubts on the reliability of the evaluation mechanism employed at SO. Moreover, many users raise concerns against the evaluation, especially downvotes to their posts. Therefore, rigorous verification of the subjective evaluation is highly warranted to ensure a non-biased and reliable quality assessment mechanism.

More specifically, we explore the prevalence of TD in security-related queries, identify the security tags most prone to TD, and investigate which user groups are more aware of TD. Method: We mined 117,233 security-related questions on SO and used a deep-learning approach to identify 45,078 security-related TD questions. Subsequently, we conducted quantitative and qualitative analyses of the collected security-related TD questions, including sentiment analysis. Results: Our analysis revealed that 38% of the security questions on SO are security-related TD questions. The most recurrent tags among the security-related TD questions emerged as “security” and “encryption.” The latter typically have a neutral sentiment, are lengthier, and are posed by users with higher reputation scores. Conclusions: Our findings reveal that developers implicitly discuss TD, suggesting developers have a potential knowledge gap regarding the TD metaphor in the security domain. Moreover, we identified the most common security topics mentioned in TD-related posts, providing valuable insights for developers and researchers to assist developers in prioritizing security concerns in order to minimize TD and enhance software security.","","978-1-6654-5223-6","10.1109/ESEM56168.2023.10304868","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10304868","Technical Debt;Security Vulnerability;Stack Overflow;Crowdsourcing","Sentiment analysis;Malware;Encryption;Security;Software measurement;Software engineering","","3","","56","IEEE","8 Nov 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Given the abundance of relevant posts, navigating them and comparing different solutions is tedious and time-consuming. Recent work has proposed to automatically summarize SO posts to concise text to facilitate the navigation of SO posts. However, these techniques rely only on information retrieval methods or heuristics for text summarization, which is insufficient to handle the ambiguity and sophistication of natural language. This paper presents a deep learning based framework called Assortfor SO post summarization. Assortincludes two complementary learning methods, $\mathbf{Assort}_{S}$ and $\mathbf{Assort}_{IS}$, to address the lack of labeled training data for SO post summarization. $\mathbf{Assort}_{S}$ is designed to directly train a novel ensemble learning model with BERT embeddings and domain-specific features to account for the unique characteristics of SO posts. By contrast, $\mathbf{Assort}_{IS}$ is designed to reuse pre-trained models while addressing the domain shift challenge when no training data is present (i.e., zero-shot learning). Both $\mathbf{Assort}_{S}$ and $\mathbf{Assort}_{IS}$ outperform six existing techniques by at least 13% and 7% respectively in terms of the F1 score. Furthermore, a human study shows that participants significantly preferred summaries generated by $\mathbf{Assort}_{S}$ and $\mathbf{Assort}_{IS}$ over the best baseline, while the preference difference between $\mathbf{Assort}_{S}$ and $\mathbf{Assort}_{IS}$ was small.","1558-1225","978-1-6654-5701-9","10.1109/ICSE48619.2023.00158","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10172574","Stack Overflow;Text Summarization;Deep Learning","Learning systems;Navigation;Natural languages;Training data;Programming;Information retrieval;Data models","","3","","71","IEEE","14 Jul 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These questions can be partly or completely answered by identifying distributions of response times, correlating features with response times, and/or predicting the actual response times. We address distribution, correlation and prediction of response times in Stack Overflow. We analyzed response times of over two million question-answer threads. We found no strong correlation between response times and features studied in other messaging domains: (a) use of various kinds of pronouns and punctuations, and (b) the time of day, and day of week when messages were sent. We found that title lengths show a quadratic relationship with median response time and that mean response times vary according to the tags used in a post. We explored a large design space of prediction algorithms based on the distributions of response times. These approaches predicted ranges of time that were automatically determined using a clustering algorithm. The best results were given by an approach that combines, using an index-base weighted-average algorithm introduced here, the most frequent time-ranges in the distributions for the tags in the posts.","","978-1-63190-043-3","10.4108/icst.collaboratecom.2014.257265","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7014584","online forums;response time;prediction;Stack Overflow","Message systems;Androids;Humanoid robots;Visual databases;Debugging;Facebook;HTML","","3","","11","","22 Jan 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we aim to automate such a classification of SO posts into seven question categories. As a first step, we have manually created a curated data set of 500 SO posts, classified into the seven categories. Using this data set, we apply machine learning algorithms (Random Forest and Support Vector Machines) to build a classification model for SO questions. We then experiment with 82 different configurations regarding the preprocessing of the text and representation of the input data. The results of the best performing models show that our models can classify posts into the correct question category with an average precision and recall of 0.88 and 0.87 when using Random Forest and the phrases indicating a question category as input data for the training.

Prior studies have found that deep learning or SVM technique can effectively predict the class of linkable knowledge units. However, they focus on short-distance semantic relationship but fail to capture global information (semantic relationship between a word and all the words in the same knowledge unit) and ignore joint semantics (semantic relationship between a word with all the words in different knowledge units). To address the issues, we propose a Self-Attention-based contextual semantic aware Linkable Knowledge prediction model (SALKU). SALKU leverages self-attention to pay attention to all the words in a knowledge unit and fully capture the global information needed for each word, then utilizes a variant of self-attention to extract joint semantics between two knowledge units. Experiment results on an existing dataset show that SALKU out-performs the state-of-the-art approaches CNN, Tuning SVM, and Soft-cos SVM in terms of three metrics, respectively.

An API tutorial can be divided into a number of consecutive units that describe the same topic, denoted as tutorial fragments. We consider a tutorial fragment explaining the API usage knowledge as a relevant fragment of the API. Discovering relevant tutorial fragments of APIs can facilitate API understanding and learning. However, existing approaches, based on supervised or unsupervised approaches, often suffer from either high manual efforts or lack of consideration of the relevance information. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, called SO2RT, to detect relevant tutorial fragments of APIs based on SO posts. SO2RT first automatically extracts relevant and irrelevant 〈API,QA〉 pairs based on heuristic rules of SO, and constructs 〈API, FRA〉 pairs (FRA stands out fragment) by using tutorial fragments and APIs. SO2RT then trains a semi-supervised transfer learning based detection model, which can transfer the API usage knowledge in SO Q&A pairs to tutorial fragments by utilizing the easy-to-extract relevance of 〈API, QA〉 pairs. Finally, relevant fragments of APIs can be discovered by consulting the trained model. In this way, the effort for labeling the relevance between tutorial fragments and APIs can be reduced. We evaluate SO2RT on Java and Android datasets containing 21,008 〈API, QA〉 pairs. Experimental results show that SO2RT improves the state-of-the-art approaches in terms of F-Measure on both datasets.

Unfortunately, they often miss required code snippets during their question submission. Such a practice could prevent their questions from getting prompt and appropriate answers. In this study, we conduct an empirical study investigating the cause & effect of missing code snippets in SO questions whenever required. In this paper, our contributions are threefold. First, we analyze how the presence or absence of required code snippets in SO questions affects the correlation between question types (missed code, included code after requests & had code snippets during submission) and corresponding answer meta-data, such as the presence of an accepted answer. According to our analysis, the chance of getting accepted answers is three times higher for questions that include required code snippets during their question submission than those that missed the code. We also investigate the confounding factors (e.g., user reputation) that can affect questions receiving answers besides the presence or absence of required code snippets. We found that such factors do not hurt the correlation between the presence or absence of required code snippets and answer meta-data. Second, we surveyed 64 practitioners to understand why users miss necessary code snippets. About 60% of them agree that users are unaware of whether their questions require any code snippets. Third, we thus extract four text-based features (e.g., keywords, POS-based patterns) and build six Machine Learning (ML) models to identify the questions that need code snippets. Our models can predict the target questions with 86.5 % precision, 90.8 % recall, 85.3 % F1-score, and 85.2 % overall accuracy, which are highly promising. Our work has the potential to ($a$) save significant time in programming question-answering and (b) improve the quality of the valuable knowledge base by decreasing unanswered and unresolved questions.","2640-7574","979-8-3503-3066-3","10.1109/SANER60148.2024.00083","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10589874","Stack Overflow;question quality;code snippets;user study;prediction models","Analytical models;Codes;Correlation;Accuracy;Knowledge based systems;Machine learning;Programming","","2","","59","IEEE","16 Jul 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

"Providing Real-time Assistance for Repairing Runtime Exceptions using Stack Overflow Posts","S. Mahajan; M. R.

Traditional Automatic Program Repair (APR) tools are of limited use in this “in-development” use case, since they require a test-suite to be available as a patching oracle. Thus, developers typically tend to manually resolve their in-development REs, often by referring to technical forums, such as Stack Overflow (SO). To automate this manual process we extend our previous work, MaesTro, to provide real-time assistance to developers for repairing Java REs by recommending a relevant patch-suggesting SO post and synthesizing a repair patch from this post to fix the RE in the developer's code. Maestro exploits a library of Runtime Exception Patterns (REPs) semi-automatically mined from SO posts, through a relatively inexpensive, one-time, incremental process. An REP is an abstracted sequence of statements that triggers a given RE. REPs are used to index SO posts, retrieve a post most relevant to the RE instance exhibited by a developer's code and then mediate the process of extracting a concrete repair from the SO post, abstracting out post-specific details, and concretizing the repair to the developer's buggy code. We evaluate MaesTro on a published RE benchmark comprised of 78 instances. Maestro is able to generate a correct repair patch at the top position in 27% of the cases, within the top-3 in 40% of the cases and overall return a useful artifact in 81% of the cases. Further, the use of REPs proves instrumental to all aspects of Maestro's performance, from ranking and searching of SO posts to synthesizing patches from a given post. In particular, 45% of correct patches generated by MaesTro could not be produced by a baseline technique not using REPs, even when provided with Maestro's SO-post ranking. Maestro is also fast, needing around 1 second, on average, to generate its output. Overall, these results indicate that Maestro can provide effective real-time assistance to developers in repairing REs.","2159-4848","978-1-6654-6679-0","10.1109/ICST53961.2022.00030","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9787856","program repair;exceptions;Stack Overflow","Software testing;Java;Codes;Runtime;Manuals;Maintenance engineering;Benchmark testing","","2","","66","IEEE","8 Jun 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Prior studies have already demonstrated that external links bring valuable information, thus enhancing the software engineering knowledge quality within the community. Nowadays, the act of users referencing internal links has formed connected knowledge subgraphs with question threads as nodes and internal links as edges. However, the characteristics of the subgraphs have not been investigated. It is still unclear how and why users reference internal links within the subgraphs. In addition, the impact of internal links within the subgraphs on the community is yet to be explored. Therefore, we constructed subgraphs through internal links and analyzed their structural stability based on the official SO data dump. Subsequently, we employed qualitative analysis methods to explore how and why developers reference internal links within the subgraphs. Finally, we conducted a quantitative analysis to assess the impact of the subgraphs on the community. We observed the subgraphs are structurally stable, with a slowing expansion rate. Meanwhile, We found that 82.4% of links were cited without summarizing the content. Notably, 64.3% of links without summaries are likely to hinder knowledge comprehension once they become obsolete. This is especially pronounced for links cited for “providing solutions to subproblem”, reaching as high as 96.9%. Our quantitative analysis has uncovered the last updated time of question threads within the subgraphs is closer to the present. Simultaneously, they also exhibit a lower deletion rate. Based on our findings, we provide actionable suggestions for developers, SO community, and researchers. For example, we encourage researchers to develop a visualization tool that can visualize question threads and their internal links from the “linked” list as graphs. This facilitates in-depth exploration of specific software engineering topics.","2693-9371","979-8-3503-6565-8","10.1109/QRS-C63300.2024.00019","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62202223,62272225); Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province, China(grant numbers:BK20220881); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:NS2023048); Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics(grant numbers:xcxjh20231606); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10727041","Empirical Software Engineering;Stack Overflow;Connected Knowledge Subgraphs;Internal Link","Knowledge engineering;Visualization;Statistical analysis;Software quality;Stability analysis;Structural engineering;Software reliability;Security;Thermal stability;Software engineering","","","","25","IEEE","29 Oct 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We use data from Stack Overflow (SO), the largest developer question-and-answer platform, to understand the interests and difficulties of DevOps. First, we collected all DevOps-related posts from 2009 to 2022 based on SO tags. Then we used the Latent Dirichlet Allocation model to identify topics, and manually analyzed time trends and hot topics. The results indicate that: (1) DevOps-related issues can be divided into four categories: Container, Pipeline, Configuration, and Deployment; (2) The issues that get more attention are DevOps foundation issues, cloud deployment failure issues, Kubernetes technology usage issues, and DevOps complex environment issues, while the most difficult issues to solve are CI/CD-related issues; (3) DevOps has been introduced since 2009 and the number of questions on the SO platform is growing, especially between 2014 and 2020; (4) The percentage of DevOps-related questions with no accepted answers on the SO platform reached 56.3%. Our results show that problems are evident in terms of complex environments and the lack of experts.

It is not only used for data analytics but is also applied in software development. Although it has several benefits, users have various issues while running Python code. When programmers face issues, they often use Stack Overflow (SO) to get assistance for their problems. However, many Pythonrelated questions on SO are not responded to and remain unanswered. Thus, in this paper, we analyzed these unanswered questions to identify potential weaknesses of user and discussion characteristics. We applied a mixed-methods approach, including quantitative and qualitative analysis of user reputation, question types, and discussion topics. Our analysis shows that unanswered questions are mostly from low-reputation users ($\mathbf{7 2. 5 2 \%}$), followed by mid-reputation users $(\mathbf{1 7. 9 3 \%}$), and high-reputation users $\mathbf{(9. 5 5 \%)}$. The distribution of the unanswered question types shows that low-reputation users ask more “how” type of question ($\mathbf{3 8. 9 0 \%}$) followed by mid and high-reputation users. In contrast, the “what” and “why” questions are mostly posted by high-reputation users, followed by mid and low-reputation users. Our word-cloud analysis suggests a correlation between user reputation and the question topics. We acknowledge that there are limitations in our study, include potential misclassifications due to the time of posting and biases in manual labeling, which may affect the accuracy of our findings. This study provides insights into unanswered questions posted by the community, open up potential areas for future work such as improving support mechanisms and community engagement.","","979-8-3503-7621-0","10.1109/ICITRI62858.2024.10699159","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10699159","Python;topics;types;unanswered questions;user reputations","Technological innovation;Information sharing;System integration;Manuals;Encoding;Labeling;Information technology;Faces;Python;Software development management","","","","27","IEEE","2 Oct 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, severe consequences might arise if the incorporated SO code snippets contain code smells that cause software inconsistency. In particular, software bugs and failures cost trillions of dollars every year, including severe fatalities. This study reveals the impact of SO code fragments reused in mobile application codebase regarding software bugs and imminent maintenance. Additionally, we perform an intense analysis on reused code snippets (SO) and other (nonSO) code snippets for ten open-source and industrial projects. Later, we also investigate the regular properties of SO answers (i.e., answer scores and answerer reputation) to know whether those properties help identify appropriate SO fragments when reused, considering that 2.1 million SO code snippets are written in Java. The analysis exhibits, 1) the proportion of reused SO code is comparatively higher in industrial mobile apps than in open-source; 2) SO code fragments are significantly more change-prone than non-SO code; 3) SO code snippets are responsible for bug occurrence in later revisions, which is comparatively higher in industrial projects than in open-source ones. Besides, the SO code snippets cannot be judged whether it is buggy or not using the regular properties (i.e., answer scores and answerer reputation). Our experimental results can assist the SO, research, and mobile developer communities in strengthening re-usability concerns to facilitate code-quality improvement and minimize software bugs due to SO code.","2572-6587","978-1-6654-8447-3","10.1109/IWSC55060.2022.00020","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9978269","Software Maintenance;Software Bugs;Stack Overflow;Code Cloning;Statistical Significance","Java;Codes;Costs;Conferences;Computer bugs;Cloning;Maintenance engineering","","","","35","IEEE","14 Dec 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This makes it difficult for learners to transfer knowledge from textbooks to practice.To solve this problem, this paper proposes a programming language learning service, utilizing abundant development knowledge in Stack Overflow (SO) Q&A posts as the pragmatics knowledge of programming languages to make up for the shortage of pragmatics knowledge in textbooks. To link SO Q&A posts with textbooks, this paper first proposes a deep learning classification model to recognize SO posts containing development knowledge. Second, to align filtered SO posts with programming language learning processes, this paper proposes a weakly supervised link approach to matching SO posts with chapters and sections of textbooks. The feature of weak supervision ensures that the approach can be easily extended to other textbooks. Based on these modules above, this paper implements the programming language learning service in the form of a Chrome plugin. We conduct experiments and user study.

In this regard, it is important to choose an appropriate stack size which does not cause stack overflows and at the same time does not waste scarce memory resources by overestimating the required thread stack size. In this paper we propose an in-vivo technique for stack overflow detection and stack size estimation that leverages Virtual Prototypes (VPs) and is specifically tailored for low-end multithreaded IoT operating systems. We focus on SystemC-based VPs which operate on the TLM abstraction level. VPs are an industrial proven modeling standard to enable early software development and testing. We propose a non-intrusive extension for existing VPs which allows detecting stack overflows and provides a stack size estimation, which is beneficial to a VP-based development process. Our analysis works in-vivo, hence no modification of the executed software binary is required between testing and deployment. Our evaluation using the RIOT operating system revealed two previously unknown stack overflows in RIOT and identified potential stack size overestimation.","1636-9874","978-1-6654-1825-6","10.1109/FDL53530.2021.9568384","German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9568384","Memory Usage;Constrained Devices;Virtual Prototypes;RISC-V;RIOT;Stack Overflows;IoT","Operating systems;Instruction sets;Memory management;Estimation;Prototypes;Software;Time-domain analysis","","","","24","IEEE","26 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The selection of inappropriate technologies for development may have a far-reaching effect on software developers' career growth. Switching to a different technology after working with one may lead to a complex learning curve and, thus, be more challenging. Therefore, it is crucial for software developers to find technologies that have a high usage span. Intuitively, the usage span of a technology can be deter-mined by the time span developers have used that technology. Existing literature focuses on the technology landscape to explore the complex and implicit dependencies among technologies but lacks formal studies to draw insights about their usage span. This paper investigates the technology usage span by analyzing the question and answering (Q&A) traces of Stack Overflow (SO), the largest technical Q&A website available to date. In particular, we analyze 6.7 million Q&A traces posted by about 97K active SO users and see what technologies have appeared in their questions or answers over 15 years. According to our analysis, C# and Java programming languages have a high usage span, followed by JavaScript. Besides, developers used the. NET framework, iO $S$ & Windows Operating Systems (OS), and SQL query language for a long time (on average). Our study also exposes the emerging (i.e., newly growing) technologies. For example, usages of technologies such as SwiftUI,. NET-6.0, Visual Studio 2022, and Blazor WebAssembly framework are increasing. The findings from our study can assist novice developers, startup software industries, and software users in determining appropriate technologies.

A recent paper by Edbert et al. studied the difference between security-related TD questions, and security-related non- TD questions on Stack Overflow (SO). One of the characteristics under investigation is the sentiment expressed in these two categories as sentiment provides insight into developers' attitudes and emotions toward security-related TD. To this end, Edbert et al. used a general-purpose, off-the-shelf, sentiment analysis tool. However, previous research has shown that general-purpose off-the-shelf sentiment tools are potentially unreliable when applied to software engineering texts. Therefore, we replicate the study by Edbert et al. using state-of-the-art sentiment analysis tools purpose-built and fine-tuned on SE data, to understand whether and how tool-choice influences the obtained results. We consider both shallow (Senti4SD) and deep learning (BERT4SentiSE) tools. To further understand the differences between shallow and deep-learning sentiment analysis tools, we perform a qualitative analysis into the underlying reasons for tools disagreement. We identify five categories of disagreements: misunderstanding context, courtesy phrases, subjective sentiment, brevity, and divergent examples. Our results are relevant to academics, reiterating the relevance of careful selection of tools used to perform sentiment analysis. Furthermore, the results are relevant to users and developers of sentiment analysis tools, as they inform tool selection dependent on the application domain, and provide insight into optimization of the pre-processing steps.

In this work, we conduct a study on GitHub (GH) and Stack Overflow (SO) and explore three Reactive Extensions (Rx) libraries (RxJava, RxJS, and RxSwift) with the most GH projects to understand how much the vast Rx operators are being used. Also, we examine Rx SO posts to complement the results from the GH exploration by understanding the problems faced by RP developers and how they relate with the operators' frequencies found in open source projects. Results reveal that, in spite of its API size, the great majority of the Rx operators are actually being used (95.2%), with only a few, mostly related to RxJava, not being utilized. Also, we unveil 23 topics from SO with more posts concerning the Stream Abstraction (36.4%). Posts related to Dependency Management, Introductory Questions, and iOS Development figure as relevant topics to the community. The findings herein present can not only stimulate advancements in the field by understanding the usage of RP API and the main problems faced by developers, but also help newcomers in identifying the most important operators and the areas that are the most likely to be relevant for a RP application.","2574-3864","978-1-4503-9303-4","10.1145/3524842.3527966","INES; CNPq(grant numbers:465614/2014-0); FACEPE(grant numbers:APQ-0399-1.03/17,APQ/0388-1.03/14); CAPES(grant numbers:88887.136410/2017-00); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9796297","Reactive Programming;API Usability;Mining Software Repositories","Debugging;Programming;Libraries;Software;Data mining;Usability;Software development management","","","","36","","21 Jun 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A foundational research of spatial crowdsourcing is to allocate micro-tasks to suitable crowd workers. Most existing studies focus on offline scenarios, where all the spatiotemporal information of micro-tasks and crowd workers is given. However, they are impractical since micro-tasks and crowd workers in real applications appear dynamically and their spatiotemporal information cannot be known in advance. In this paper, to address the shortcomings of existing offline approaches, we first identify a more practical micro-task allocation problem, called the Global Online Micro-task Allocation in spatial crowdsourcing (GOMA) problem. We first extend the state-of-art algorithm for the online maximum weighted bipartite matching problem to the GOMA problem as the baseline algorithm. Although the baseline algorithm provides theoretical guarantee for the worst case, its average performance in practice is not good enough since the worst case happens with a very low probability in real world. Thus, we consider the average performance of online algorithms, a.k.a online random order model.We propose a two-phase-based framework, based on which we present the TGOA algorithm with 1 over 4 -competitive ratio under the online random order model. To improve its efficiency, we further design the TGOA-Greedy algorithm following the framework, which runs faster than the TGOA algorithm but has lower competitive ratio of 1 over 8. Finally, we verify the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed methods through extensive experiments on real and synthetic datasets.","","978-1-5090-2020-1","10.1109/ICDE.2016.7498228","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7498228","","Crowdsourcing;Resource management;Algorithm design and analysis;Spatiotemporal phenomena;Heuristic algorithms;Real-time systems;Mobile communication","","229","","35","IEEE","23 Jun 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

First, our outsource-then-prove methodology resolves the tension between blockchain transparency and data confidentiality, which is critical in crowdsourcing use-case. ZebraLancer ensures: (i) a requester will not pay more than what data deserve, according to a policy announced when her task is published via the blockchain; (ii) each worker indeed gets a payment based on the policy, if he submits data to the blockchain; (iii) the above properties are realized not only without a central arbiter, but also without leaking the data to the open blockchain. Furthermore, the transparency of blockchain allows one to infer private information about workers and requesters through their participation history. On the other hand, allowing anonymity will enable a malicious worker to submit multiple times to reap rewards. ZebraLancer overcomes this problem by allowing anonymous requests/submissions without sacrificing the accountability. The idea behind is a subtle linkability: if a worker submits twice to a task, anyone can link the submissions, or else he stays anonymous and unlinkable across tasks. To realize this delicate linkability, we put forward a novel cryptographic concept, i.e. the common-prefix-linkable anonymous authentication. We remark the new anonymous authentication scheme might be of independent interest. Finally, we implement our protocol for a common image annotation task and deploy it in a test net of Ethereum. The experiment results show the applicability of our protocol with the existing real-world blockchain.","2575-8411","978-1-5386-6871-9","10.1109/ICDCS.2018.00087","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8416350","anonymity;blockchain;privacy","Crowdsourcing;Task analysis;Protocols;Contracts;Authentication;Cryptography","","140","1","53","IEEE","23 Jul 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We consider a category of crowdsourcing applications where a group of individuals volunteer (or are recruited to) share certain observations or measurements about the physical world. Examples include reporting locations of gas stations that remain operational after a natural disaster or reporting locations of potholes on city streets. We call such applications social sensing. Ascertaining the correctness of reported observations is a key challenge in such applications, referred to as the truth estimation problem. This problem is made difficult by the fact that the reliability of individual sources is usually unknown a priori, since any concerned citizen may, in principle, participate. Moreover, the timescales of crowdsourcing campaigns of interest can be as small as a few hours or days, which does not offer enough history for a reputation system to converge. Instead, recent prior work, including our own, developed fact-finding algorithms to solve this problem by iteratively assessing the credibility of sources and their claims in the absence of reputation scores. Such algorithms, however, operate on the entire dataset of reported observations in a batch fashion, which makes them less suited to applications where new observations arrive continually. In this paper, we describe a streaming fact-finder that recursively updates previous estimates based on new data. The recursive algorithm solves an expectation maximization (EM) problem to determine the odds of correctness of different observations. We compare the performance of our recursive EM algorithm to a batch EM algorithm, as well as to several state-of-art fact-finders through extensive simulations. We also demonstrate convergence of the recursive algorithm to the results of the batch version through a real social sensing experiment. Our evaluation shows that the proposed approach can process data streams much more efficiently while keeping the truth estimation accuracy close to that of the (much slower) batch algorithm. Ours is therefore the first fact-finder developed with explicit consideration to the continuous update needs of crowd-sourcing applications.","1063-6927","978-0-7695-5000-8","10.1109/ICDCS.2013.54","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6681622","real-time;truth discovery;recursive expectation maximization;streaming data;social sensing","Estimation;Reliability;Sensors;Equations;Mathematical model;Atmospheric measurements;Particle measurements","","92","","40","IEEE","12 Dec 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"A hybrid machine-crowdsourcing system for matching web tables","J. Fan; M. Lu; B. C. Ooi; W. -C. Tan; M.

An essential problem of web data integration is to discover semantic correspondences between web table columns, and schema matching is a popular means to determine the semantic correspondences. However, conventional schema matching techniques are not always effective for web table matching due to the incompleteness in web tables. In this paper, we propose a two-pronged approach for web table matching that effectively addresses the above difficulties. First, we propose a concept-based approach that maps each column of a web table to the best concept, in a well-developed knowledge base, that represents it. This approach overcomes the problem that sometimes values of two web table columns may be disjoint, even though the columns are related, due to incompleteness in the column values. Second, we develop a hybrid machine-crowdsourcing framework that leverages human intelligence to discern the concepts for “difficult” columns. Our overall framework assigns the most “beneficial” column-to-concept matching tasks to the crowd under a given budget and utilizes the crowdsourcing result to help our algorithm infer the best matches for the rest of the columns. We validate the effectiveness of our framework through an extensive experimental study over two real-world web table data sets. The results show that our two-pronged approach outperforms existing schema matching techniques at only a low cost for crowdsourcing.","2375-026X","978-1-4799-2555-1","10.1109/ICDE.2014.6816716","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6816716","","Films;Catalogs;Semantics;Educational institutions;Entropy;Motion pictures;Accuracy","","78","4","26","IEEE","19 May 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We model such interactions as online double auctions, explicitly taking the dynamic nature of both users and providers into account We propose a general framework for the design of truthful online double auctions for dynamic mobile crowdsourcing. The framework is expressive and can work with different price schedules.

Recently, mobile crowdsourcing, which can leverage workers' data from smartphones for data aggregation and analysis, has attracted much attention. However, when the data volume is getting large, it becomes a difficult problem for a requester to aggregate and analyze the incoming data, especially when the requester is an ordinary smartphone user or a start-up company with limited storage and computation resources. Besides, workers are concerned about their identity and data privacy. To tackle these issues, we introduce a three-party architecture for mobile crowdsourcing, where the cloud is implemented between workers and requesters to ease the storage and computation burden of the resource-limited requester. Identity privacy and data privacy are also achieved. With our scheme, a requester is able to verify the correctness of computation results from the cloud. We also provide several aggregated statistics in our work, together with efficient data update methods. Extensive simulation shows both the feasibility and efficiency of our proposed solution.","","978-1-4673-9953-1","10.1109/INFOCOM.2016.7524547","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7524547","Mobile Crowdsourcing;Cloud Computing;Security and Privacy;Verifiable Computation","Cloud computing;Data privacy;Crowdsourcing;Smart phones;Mobile communication;Sensors","","61","","34","IEEE","28 Jul 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

One of the major issues in spatial crowdsourcing is task assignment, which allocates tasks to appropriate workers. However, existing works generally assume the static offline scenarios, where the spatio-temporal information of all the workers and tasks is determined and known a priori. Ignorance of the dynamic spatio-temporal distributions of workers and tasks can often lead to poor assignment results. In this work we study a novel spatial crowdsourcing problem, namely Predictive Task Assignment (PTA), which aims to maximize the number of assigned tasks by taking into account both current and future workers/tasks that enter the system dynamically with location unknown in advance. We propose a two-phase data-driven framework. The prediction phase hybrids different learning models to predict the locations and routes of future workers and designs a graph embedding approach to estimate the distribution of future tasks. In the assignment component, we propose both greedy algorithm for large-scale applications and optimal algorithm with graph partition based decomposition. Extensive experiments on two real datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework.","2375-026X","978-1-7281-2903-7","10.1109/ICDE48307.2020.00009","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9101480","prediction;task assignment;spatial crowdsourcing","Task analysis;Crowdsourcing;Servers;Prediction algorithms;Real-time systems;Spatial databases;Predictive models","","51","","29","IEEE","27 May 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Many studies are exploring the use of deep learning (DL) algorithms for localization. DL's ability to extract features and to classify autonomously makes it an attractive solution for fingerprint-based localization. These solutions require frequent retraining of DL models with vast amounts of measurements. Although crowdsourcing is an excellent way to gather immense amounts of data, it jeopardizes the privacy of participants, as it requires to collect labeled data at a centralized server. Recently, federated learning has emerged as a practical concept in solving the privacy preservation issue of crowdsourcing participants by performing model training at the edge devices in a decentralized manner; the participants do not expose their data anymore to a centralized server. This paper presents a novel method utilizing federated learning to improve the accuracy of RSS fingerprint-based localization while preserving the privacy of the crowdsourcing participants. Employing federated learning allows ensuring preserving the privacy of user data while enabling an adequate localization performance with experimental data captured in real-world settings. The proposed method improved localization accuracy by 1.8 meters when used as a booster for centralized learning and achieved satisfactory localization accuracy when used standalone.","2376-6506","978-1-7281-3129-0","10.1109/IWCMC48107.2020.9148111","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9148111","Crowdsourcing;Deep Learning;Federated Learning;Fingerprint;Indoor Localization;Neural Networks;Privacy-Preserving;Received Signal Strength","Training;Crowdsourcing;Data models;Servers;Machine learning;Data privacy;Meters","","42","","16","IEEE","27 Jul 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Research in behavioral psychology has indicated that large groups hinder successful collaboration. Taking that into consideration, our work is one of the first to investigate and formalize the notion of collaboration among workers and present theoretical analyses to understand the hardness of optimizing task assignment. We propose efficient approximation algorithms with provable theoretical guarantees and demonstrate the superiority of our algorithms through a comprehensive set of experiments using real-world and synthetic datasets.
