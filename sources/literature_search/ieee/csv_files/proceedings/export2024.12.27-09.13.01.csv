On one hand, different tasks offer different amount of incentive budgets in multitask systems, thus those tasks pay more should be satisfied preferentially. On the other hand, even if there are not enough budget for a sensing task, the system should also try to provide as much sensory data as possible to obtain potential clients. Furthermore, it is challenging to select an “optimal” set of participants as data contributors due to the above two points. In this paper, first, we introduce a metric to describe how the collected sensory data can quantify task's the multi-dimensional data requirements, in terms of data distribution in spatiotemporal domains. Second, we propose a “task priority model” based on incentive budget, to explicitly quantify the relationship between the incentive budget usage and task priority. Then, we present a quality of information (QoI) aware participant selection approach as a suboptimal solution to the defined optimization problem. Finally, we compare our proposed scheme with existing methods via extensive simulations based on the real movement traces of ordinary citizens in Beijing. Extensive simulation results well justify the effectiveness and robustness of our approach.","","978-1-4673-6782-0","10.1109/PIMRC.2015.7343555","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7343555","","Sensors;Servers;Mobile communication;Crowdsourcing;Mobile computing;Optimization","","","","14","IEEE","3 Dec 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Evaluating students’ performance in online education has always been challenging. Objective questions, which can be graded automatically, could only assess certain aspects of students’ mastery of knowledge. A grading problem appears if subjective questions exist, primarily when the class is taught at scale. Many online education platforms have been using peer assessment to resolve this problem. Aside from that, peer assessment also improves interactions between students, instructors, and peers. While peer assessment has some inherent weaknesses, reviewers may not have the same ability or attitude toward reviewing others, and the feedback generated by them shall not be taken at face value. Many algorithms have been developed to evaluate annotators’ trustworthiness and generate reliable labels in the crowdsourcing industry. We proposed an algorithm under the same concept that could provide accurate automated grading, an overview of students’ weaknesses from peer feedback, and identify reviewers who lack an understanding of certain concepts.

In FL, evaluating model quality is crucial for detecting malicious clients and improving model accuracy. However, existing methods typically require a representative public testing dataset on the server, which is often unavailable in practical federated learning scenarios. To address this problem, we propose a novel four-step framework, taking a crowdsourcing approach. The basic idea is to distribute the model to be evaluated as a task to a set of testing clients selected from the original clients pool, who evaluate the model quality using their local datasets. By consolidating these individual evaluations, we obtain the overall model quality. To select a suitable number of testing clients, we propose an exploration-exploitation-based framework. Furthermore, to safeguard against attacks from potential malicious testing clients, we introduce a Correlated Agreement (CA) mechanism. This is achieved by comparing correlations of accuracy among the same set of testing clients (who were selected for the aforementioned evaluation task). Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, which yields accuracy comparable to methods that rely on a public testing dataset on the server. Moreover, our approach can identify and filter out dishonest testing clients and thereby ensure model quality even in adversarial settings.","2324-9013","979-8-3503-8199-3","10.1109/TrustCom60117.2023.00048","National Natural Science Foundation of China; National Science Foundation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10538580","Federated learning;crowdsourcing;model testing;correlated agreement","Crowdsourcing;Data privacy;Correlation;Robustness;Data models;Servers;Security","","","","23","IEEE","29 May 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We evaluate the performance using ground-truth locations for 4,946 LTE cells, covering a representative subset of the infrastructure of an Austrian operator. Careful analysis confirms the well-known quality issues of crowdsourced data, with 5.8% of samples effectively reporting negative multipath components. Incorporating the notion of erroneous measurements into our system model ensures that the presence of such outliers is reflected in the posterior confidence of the estimator. Overall, this adapted approach significantly outperforms the baseline estimators from the literature, achieving an accuracy of above 97.5% in a cell-identification framework and mean distance errors of around 100 m.

Intuitively, a task result derived from a sufficient number of reports bears lower uncertainty, and higher uncertainty otherwise. Existing report aggregation research, however, has largely neglected the above uncertainty issue. In this regard, we propose a novel report aggregation framework that defines and incorporates a new confidence measure to quantify the uncertainty associated with tasks and workers, thereby enhancing result accuracy. In particular, we employ a link analysis approach to propagate confidence information, subgraph extraction techniques to prioritize workers, and a progressive approach to gradually explore and consolidate workers’ reports associated with less confident workers and tasks. The framework is generic enough to be combined with existing report aggregation methods.

However, the unsecured wireless communication channels and limited computational resources of drones in typical IoDT scenarios make them susceptible to cyber-attacks, including spoofing, GPS manipulation, impersonation, man-in-the-middle, and hijacking. To counter these threats, we propose a robust security protocol that utilizes blockchain technology augmented by Hyperelliptic Curve Cryptography (HECC).

To cope with the issue of noisy and sometimes malicious input from workers, trust is used to model workers' expertise.

To address this issue, we propose a probabilistic model to jointly infer multi-dimensional trust of workers, multi-domain properties of questions, and true labels of questions. Our model is very flexible and extensible to incorporate metadata associated with questions. To show that, we further propose two extended models, one of which handles input tasks with real-valued features and the other handles tasks with text features by incorporating topic models. Finally, we evaluate our model on real-world datasets and demonstrate that our model is superior to state-of-the-art and the two extended models have even better performance. In addition, our models can effectively recover trust vectors of workers, which can be very useful in task assignment adaptive to workers' trust in the future. These results can be applied for fusion of information from multiple data sources like sensors, human input, machine learning results, or a hybrid of them.","","978-0-9824-4386-6","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7266612","","Crowdsourcing;Inference algorithms;Reliability;Approximation algorithms;Chemistry;Noise measurement;Adaptation models","","","","16","","17 Sep 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In order to address these problems, this paper proposes a personalized privacy protection incentive mechanism (PPPIM) for MCS based on homomorphic encryption and edge computing. Firstly, this paper designs a personalized privacy metric, using social attributes and private attributes of crowd workers to calculate the privacy level required by crowd workers. Then, based on homomorphic encryption and edge computing, a personalized residual federated security learning scheme (PRFSL) is proposed to ensure the security, timeliness, integrity of task data and the privacy of crowd workers’ needs to improve encryption efficiency. Finally, based on the evolutionary game, a personalized privacy incentive mechanism is proposed to improve the overall service utility.

To address this issue, several location privacy-preserving frameworks have been proposed. However, these frameworks have limited performance in terms of task assignment efficiency and lack consideration of the threat of brute force attacks under user-server collusion. Facing these challenges, in this paper, we propose an efficient grid-based privacy-preserving framework to achieve a two-sided improvement in assignment efficiency and security level. For the first challenge, we utilize a recoding algorithm to construct a grid-index Quadtree to reduce the time cost of finding suitable workers, and finally achieve faster-than-linear task assignment complexity. For the other challenge, we introduce a two cloud server model, including a Re-Server and a SC-Server, and propose a Two-Step Re-Encryption scheme based on secure Knn computation. The task assignment request is first sent to the Re-Server and then forwarded to the SC-Server after re-encryption. SC server returns the assignment result and the worker is finally notified by the Re-Server. To break the way of user-server collusion, we also design two parameters, hash signature and valid timestamp, to achieve unlinkability between data and user identities. The extensive experiments based on real-world datasets show that our framework is more efficient in task assignment than state-of-the-art works and more suitable for big data scenarios.","","979-8-3503-0969-0","10.1109/ICINC58035.2022.00032","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10090119","privacy-preserving;brute-force attacks;dishonest user;searchable encryption;spatial crowdsourcing;location-based services","Crowdsourcing;Privacy;Costs;Computational modeling;Force;Encryption;Servers","","","","28","IEEE","5 Apr 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For rechargeable sensors, the state of charge (SOC) is one of the key factors that decides the sensors' energy cost for the localization task. To conserve limited resources, the fusion center (FC) employs an optimal sensor selection scheme obtained through an auction design approach. The sensors compete to participate in the target localization task by sending bids based on their energy efficiency (analog data) and SOC (quantized data) to the FC. Aiming at maximizing the expected utility, the FC designs an optimal auction mechanism incorporating both analog information about sensors' energy efficiency and quantized information of the SOC and decides on the winning sensor(s) as well as the payment to the winner(s). Simulation experiments show the effective performance of our framework by investigating the effect of the SOC of the sensors on the utility of the FC and the target localization mean square error (MSE).","","978-0-9964-5274-8","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7527946","","Wireless sensor networks;Sensors;Atmospheric measurements;Particle measurements;Probability density function;Crowdsourcing;Energy efficiency","","","","36","","4 Aug 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Therefore, how to design allocation algorithms for the situation of increasing task complexity is particularly critical. In this paper, to cope with this problem, the idea of worker coalition collaboration and reputation evaluation mechanisms are introduced into it. A two-stage allocation based on same-region and cross-region is performed in the divided regional grid. In the first stage, multi-worker and multi-task allocation is realized by combining the reverse auction theory based on the workers’ historical reputation value, which motivates the workers with high reputation value to choose their tasks and contribute data with high sensed quality. The second stage utilizes genetic algorithms to select a coalition of workers for cross-region sensed execution for tasks that do not meet sensed quality requirements. This process will provide additional payoff incentives to compensate for travel costs within the worker coalition, increasing the number of tasks completed and maximizing social welfare. Finally, multiple comparison experiments on the real dataset Yelp are conducted for validation.","2836-3868","979-8-3503-6855-0","10.1109/ICWS62655.2024.00040","National Natural Science Foundation of China; Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province; Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10707397","Mobile Crowdsourcing;Task Allocation;Incentive Mechanism;Cross-regional","Crowdsourcing;Satellites;Web services;Collaboration;Multitasking;Complexity theory;Sensors;Resource management;Internet of Things;Genetic algorithms","","","","21","IEEE","15 Oct 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Task recommendation is crucial in helping workers discover attractive tasks. Existing studies have focused on modeling workers' preferences from past task-performing patterns, but their performance is sub-optimal due to the strong coupling of sequentiality, spatiality, and temporality. Moreover, achieving the highest preference-based utility of workers in most of the existing task recommendation studies is inferior to the benefits of the SC platform and the satisfaction of workers in a long range, due to the lower task coverage rate and the poor diversity in a worker's recommended list. To address these problems, we propose a Diversity-Coverage Balanced Task Recommendation (DCBTaskRec) framework. Specifically, we first introduce a decoupled worker preference learning model that adopts self-attention networks as the backbone and decouples the modeling of multiple factors in attention scores. Additionally, we provide an optimal diveristy-aware approach to maximize the recommendation diversity while keeping high preference-based utility of workers to satisfy the multiple tastes of workers. From the side of the SC platform, we also provide two approaches (i.e., greedy coverage-aware approach and diversity-coverage balanced approach) to achieve high coverage and provide a trade-off between diversity and coverage, respectively. Extensive experiments offer insight into the effectiveness of the proposed framework.","2375-026X","979-8-3503-1715-2","10.1109/ICDE60146.2024.00028","NSFC(grant numbers:61972069,61836007,61832017); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10597886","Spatial Crowdsourcing;Diversity;Coverage;Task Recommendation","Crowdsourcing;Performance evaluation;Couplings;Adaptation models;Aggregates;LoRa;Data engineering","","","","55","IEEE","23 Jul 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Based on the feature of CNN extraction from local to global, this paper constructs a characteristic group which includes signal intensity, user transaction time and shop information. The statistics of each feature in the statistical interval are obtained by using the interval of 1 to 23 days before the current time. The Min-Max normalization of the statistical value is to avoid inconsistencies in the data distribution caused by the loss of data. In this way, the feature map of window length and statistic feature is constructed, the different feature groups of Wi-Fi and Shop are used as input matrices of multiple CNN, then the other manual features are combined to train a CNN positioning classifier to realize the position estimation of shop-level.

Yet, most existing mechanisms only involve single tasks, neglecting the presence of complementarity and substitutability among tasks. This limits their effectiveness in practice cases. Motivated by this, we consider task bundles for incentive mechanism design and closely analyze the mutual exclusion effect that arises with task bundles. We then develop a combinatorial incentive mechanism, including three key policies: In the offline case, we propose a combinatorial assignment policy to address the conflict between mutual exclusion and assignment efficiency. We next study the conflict between mutual exclusion and truthfulness, and build a combinatorial pricing policy to pay winners that yields both incentive compatibility and individual rationality. In the online case with unknown workers’ utilities, we present an online combinatorial assignment policy that balances the exploration-exploitation trade-off under the mutual exclusion constraints.

The idea of our method is to exploit the social knowledge available from reviews about products of any kind, freely provided by customers through specialized web sites. We thus define a NoSQL database system for large collections of product reviews, where queries can be expressed in terms of natural language sentences whose answers are modeled as lists of products ranked based on the relevance of reviews w.r.t. the natural language sentences. The best ranked products in the result list can be seen as the best hints for the user based on crowd opinions (the reviews). By exploiting the well-known IMDb dataset, which comprises more than 2 million reviews for more than 100,000 movies, we experimentally shows that our prototype obtains good performance in terms of execution time, demonstrating that our approach is feasible.","","978-1-4799-5934-1","10.1109/SOCPAR.2014.7008049","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7008049","","Semantics;Natural languages;Motion pictures;Data mining;Indexing;Data structures","","","","13","IEEE","15 Jan 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Because of the information asymmetry between crowdsourcer and users, one problem called moral hazard may arise, which is the crowdsourcer has no idea about whether the users will provide qualified data and how much effort exerted by them. Accordingly, it is necessary to introduce contract-based incentive mechanism to provide participants with a certain reward to overcome the moral hazard problem, so as to achieve the purpose of encouraging more users to participate data collection. A novel contract is proposed to model one crowdsourcer and multiple users engaged in exchange for data and money, in which the users are of different relationships, which are cooperative, competitive, and independent. Then, we derive the optimal contract that maximizes the crowdsourcer's utility while achieving the benefits of the users. Finally, through simulations, we reveal the key parameters' influences on the crowdsourcer's utility under three relationships, and shows the proposed contracts are efficient and effective.","","978-1-7281-4743-7","10.1109/ICCC47050.2019.9064351","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9064351","Moral hazard;crowdsourcing;contract theory;incentive mechanism","Contracts;Crowdsourcing;Task analysis;Data models;Mobile handsets;Hazards;Sensors","","","","15","IEEE","13 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

When encountering software crashes, recurring bugs that are discussed on Q&A sites could provide developers with solutions to their crashing problems. However, it is difficult for developers to accurately search for relevant content on search engines, and developers have to spend a lot of manual effort to find the right solution from the returned results. In this paper, we present CRASOLVER, an approach that takes into account both the structural information of crash traces and the knowledge of crash-causing bugs to automatically summarize solutions from crash traces. Given a crash trace, CRASOLVER retrieves relevant questions from Q&A sites by combining a proposed position dependent similarity - based on the structural information of the crash trace - with an extra knowledge similarity, based on the knowledge from official documentation sites. After obtaining the answers to these questions from the Q&A site, CRASOLVER summarizes the final solution based on a multi-factor scoring mechanism. To evaluate our approach, we built two repositories of Java and Android exception-related questions from Stack Overflow with size of 69,478 and 33,566 questions respectively. Our user study results using 50 selected Java crash traces and 50 selected Android crash traces show that our approach significantly outperforms four baselines in terms of relevance, usefulness, and diversity. The evaluation also confirms the effectiveness of the relevant question retrieval component in our approach for crash traces.","1558-1225","978-1-6654-0296-5","10.1109/ICSE43902.2021.00117","Australian Research Council; Research and Development; National Research Foundation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9401996","","Java;Computer bugs;Diversity reception;Documentation;Search engines;Software;Software engineering","","6","","63","IEEE","7 May 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Many of those chat communications contain valuable information, such as code descriptions, good programming practices, and causes of common errors/exceptions. However, the nature of chat community content is transient, as opposed to the archival nature of other developer communications such as email, bug reports and Q&A forums. As a result, important information and advice are lost over time.The focus of this dissertation is Extracting Archival Information from Software-Related Chats, specifically to (1) automatically identify conversations that contain archival-quality information, (2) accurately reduce the granularity of the information reported as archival information, and (3) conduct a case study to investigate how archival quality information extracted from chats compare to related posts in Q&A forums. Archiving knowledge from developer chats could be used potentially in several applications such as: creating a new archival mechanism available to a given chat community, augmenting Q&A forums, or facilitating the mining of specific information and improving software maintenance tools.","2574-1926","978-1-4503-7122-3","","National Science Foundation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9270292","online software developer chats;archival quality social content","Data mining;Tools;Software maintenance;Programming;Software engineering;Gold;Electronic mail","","1","","26","","1 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Thus, this work aims to address these topics. To obtain factor scores of the Q&A statements, syntactic information extracted through morphological analysis (MA) was set as the feature values in running multiple regression analysis. As an alternative method, N-gram could be utilized as the feature values. These methodologies have been established for Japanese and English Q&A statements. In the case of applying N-gram to English Q&A statements, 3-gram has been applied. Therefore, in order to ensure the method of utilizing N-gram, in this paper 4-gram is applied to the feature values of English Q&A statements. Through multiple regression analysis, it has been shown that applying 4-gram would result in as good accuracy as only MA. Thus, it could be implied that 4-gram would also be applicable to the methodology when applied to English language materials.","2472-0070","979-8-3503-7790-3","10.1109/IIAI-AAI63651.2024.00011","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10708011","Q&A statement;Factor score;N-gram;Multiple regression analysis;English language","Accuracy;Syntactics;Feature extraction;Regression analysis;Internet;Data mining;Informatics","","","","15","IEEE","15 Oct 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We introduce a novel online game called ""Bubbles"" that reveals discriminative features humans use. The player's goal is to identify the category of a heavily blurred image. During the game, the player can choose to reveal full details of circular regions (""bubbles""), with a certain penalty. With proper setup the game generates discriminative bubbles with assured quality.

In this paper, we address the incentive problem of trustworthy crowdsourced parking information systems by presenting an incentive platform named TruCentive, where high utility parking data can be obtained from unreliable crowds of mobile users. Our contribution is three-fold. First, we provide hierarchical incentives to stimulate the participation of mobile users for contributing parking information. Second, by introducing utility-related incentives, our platform encourages participants to contribute high utility data and thereby enhances the quality of collected data. Third, our active confirmation scheme validates the parking information utility by game-theoretically formulated incentive protocols. The active confirming not only validates the utility of contributed data but re-sells the high utility data as well. Our evaluation through user study on Amazon Mechanical Turk and simulation study demonstrate the feasibility and stability of TruCentive incentive platform.","2153-0017","978-1-4673-3063-3","10.1109/ITSC.2012.6338894","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6338894","","Availability;Protocols;Mobile communication;Incentive schemes;Vehicles;Sensors;Equations","","50","","18","IEEE","25 Oct 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These modules use low-end accelerometers and GPS devices to obtain vibration pattern, location, and vehicle velocity. Considering the high cost of onboard storage and wireless transmission, a novel light-weight data mining algorithm is proposed to detect road surface events and transmit potential pothole information to a central server. The server gathers reports from the multiple vehicles, and makes a comprehensive evaluation on road surface quality. We have implemented a product-quality system and deployed it on 100 taxies in the Shenzhen urban area. The results show that CRSM can detect road potholes with up to 90% accuracy, and nearly zero false alarms.

Currently, the prevalent trust evaluation mechanism employs the overall approval rate of HITs, with which dishonest workers can easily succeed in pursuing the maximal profit by quickly giving plausible answers or counterfeiting HITs approval rates. In crowd sourcing environments, a worker's trustworthiness varies in contexts, i.e. It varies in different types of tasks and different reward amounts of tasks. Thus, we propose two classifications based on task types and task reward amount respectively. On the basis of the classifications, we propose a trust evaluation model, which consists of two types of context-aware trust: task type based trust (TaTrust) and reward amount based trust (RaTrust). Then, we model trustworthy worker selection as a multi-objective combinatorial optimization problem, which is NP-hard. For solving this challenging problem, we propose an evolutionary algorithm MOWS_GA based on NSGA-II. The results of experiments illustrate that our proposed trust evaluation model can effectively differentiate honest workers and dishonest workers when both of them have high overall HITs approval rates.","","978-1-4673-7272-5","10.1109/ICWS.2015.26","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7195560","Crowdsourcing;Contextual Trust;Worker Selection;Combinatorial Optimization","Crowdsourcing;Context modeling;Context;Optimization;Evolutionary computation;Computational modeling;Australia","","32","","29","IEEE","17 Aug 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In existing CS systems, no facility has been provided for analyzing the trustworthiness of workers and providing decision support for allocating tasks to workers, which leads to high dependency of the quality of work on the behavior of workers in CS systems as shown in this paper. To address this problem, trust management mechanisms are urgently needed. Traditional trust management techniques are focused on identifying the most trustworthy service providers (SPs) as accurately as possible. Little thoughts were given to the question of how to utilize these SPs due to two common assumptions: 1) an SP can serve an unlimited number of requests in one time unit, and 2) a service consumer (SC) only needs to select one SP for interaction to complete a task. However, in CS systems, these two assumptions are no longer valid. Thus, existing models cannot be directly used for trust management in CS systems. This paper takes the first step towards a systematic investigation of trust management in CS systems by extending existing trust management models for CS trust management and conducting extensive experiments to study and analyze the performance of various trust management models in crowd sourcing. In this paper, the following key contributions are made. We 1) propose extensions to existing trust management approaches to enable them to operate in CS systems, 2) design a simulation test-bed based on the system characteristics of Amazon's Mechanical Turk (AMT) to make evaluation close to practical CS systems, 3) discuss the effect of incorporating trust management into CS system on the overall social welfare, and 4) identify the challenges and opportunities for future trust management research in CS systems.","","978-1-4673-6057-9","10.1109/WI-IAT.2012.104","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6511612","crowdsourcing;trust;reputation;interaction decision making;crowdsourcing","","","30","","19","IEEE","2 May 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

One key issue for the success of such systems is to guarantee users' participation. A strategy that has been used to promote user participation is the use of game design techniques, since games have successful strategies to grant enjoyable user experience. However, most gamification methods and guidelines are too generic, do not emphasize the collaboration aspects and focus on introducing rewarding elements into the application, instead of designing player-centric applications. Reward-based design is dangerous, specially for collaborative systems, because it may put points gathering as the primary purpose of the application instead of the collaboration goal. This paper presents G.A.M.E., a conceptual framework to guide the design of gamification in crowd sourcing-based systems. The framework provides a flexible step-by-step guideline that combines knowledge from software engineering, collaborative systems, game design and interaction design. To evaluate our proposal, we instantiated G.A.M.E. Into two applications in the domain of public transportation. The influence of gamification in those applications were evaluated through controlled navigation tests in a crowd sourcing usability testing platform. Our findings showed us that gamification improved user interfaces of collaboration activities by 16% on usability and were more trustworthy in 80% the cases.","","978-1-4799-8828-0","10.1109/ITNG.2015.78","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7113513","Gamification;Crowdsourcing Systems;Interaction Design;Conceptual Framework;End-user software engineering","Games;Collaboration;Crowdsourcing;Usability;Testing;Analytical models;Guidelines","","29","","29","IEEE","1 Jun 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The problem of assigning spatial tasks to workers in a spatial crowd sourcing system can be formulated as a weighted bipartite b-matching graph problem that can be solved optimally by existing methods for the minimum cost maximum flow problem. However, these methods are still too complex to run repeatedly for an online system, especially when the number of incoming workers and tasks increases. Hence, we propose a class of approaches that utilizes an online partitioning method to reduce the problem space across a set of cloud servers to construct independent bipartite graphs and solve the assignment problem in parallel. Our approaches solve the spatial task assignment approximately but competitive to the exact solution. We experimentally verify that our approximate approaches outperform the centralized and Map Reduce version of the exact approach with acceptable accuracy and thus suitable for online spatial crowd sourcing at scale.","2375-0324","978-1-4799-9972-9","10.1109/MDM.2015.55","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7264314","distributed spatial task assignment;spatial task assignment;online partitioning;spatial crowdsouring","Servers;Crowdsourcing;Bipartite graph;Throughput;Runtime;Performance evaluation;Clustering algorithms","","28","","36","IEEE","14 Sep 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

While the majority of Received-Signal-Strength (RSS)-fingerprint-based wireless indoor localization approaches suffer from the labor-intensive and time-consuming site-survey and the low localization accuracy, barometer-based floor localization is another promising direction due to the increasing availability of the barometer-sensor-equipped smartphones. This paper is the first indoor localization work that exploits the combination of Wi-Fi RSS and barometric pressure for accurate floor localization. Compared with an art-of-the-state algorithm, B-Loc, the highlight of the proposed Bar Fi approach is that it does not need all client smartphones but only low percentage of them equipped with barometer sensors. Using crowd sourcing, Bar Fi eliminates the need of war-driving of site-survey and prior knowledge about both the Wi-Fi infrastructure and the floor plans of buildings. The key novelty of Bar Fi is a two-phase clustering method proposed to train the RSS fingerprint floor map with the aid of barometer, which consists of a barometer-based hierarchical clustering phase and a Wi-Fi-based K-Means clustering phase. The real-world evaluation shows Bar Fi achieves satisfying performance that its accuracy reaches 96.3% when the proportion of smartphones equipped with barometer sensors is 12% out of the total.","","978-1-4673-9101-6","10.1109/MASS.2015.103","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7366957","floor localization;Wi-Fi;barometer;smartphone;crowdsourcing","IEEE 802.11 Standard;Smart phones;Floors;Crowdsourcing;GSM","","28","4","16","IEEE","7 Jan 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Due to confounding factors of pose, illumination, and expression, as well as occlusion and low resolution, current face recognition systems deployed in forensic and security applications operate in a semi-automatic manner; an operator typically reviews the top results from the face recognition system to manually determine the final match. For this reason, it is important to analyze the accuracies achieved by both the matching algorithms (machines) and humans on unconstrained face recognition tasks. In this paper, we report human accuracy on unconstrained faces in still images and videos via crowd-sourcing on Amazon Mechanical Turk. In particular, we report the first human performance on the YouTube Faces database and show that humans are superior to machines, especially when videos contain contextual cues in addition to the face image. We investigate the accuracy of humans from two different countries (United States and India) and find that humans from the United States are more accurate, possibly due to their familiarity with the faces of the public figures in the YouTube Faces database. A fusion of recognitions made by humans and a commercial-off-the-shelf face matcher improves performance over humans alone.","","978-1-4799-3584-0","10.1109/BTAS.2014.6996296","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6996296","","Face;Videos;Databases;Face recognition;Accuracy;Lighting;Protocols","","27","","21","IEEE","29 Dec 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper designs an incentive mechanism to motivate a heterogeneous crowd of users to actively participate in crowd sourcing campaigns. We cast the problem in a new, asymmetric all-pay contest model with incomplete information, where an arbitrary n of users exert irrevocable effort to compete for a prize tuple. The prize tuple is an array of prize functions as opposed to a single constant prize typically used by conventional contests. We design an optimal contest that (a) induces the maximum profit -- total user effort minus the prize payout -- for the crowdsourcer, and (b) ensures users to strictly have incentive to participate. In stark contrast to intuition and prior related work, our mechanism induces an equilibrium in which heterogeneous users behave independently of one another as if they were in a homogeneous setting. This newly discovered property, which we coin as strategy autonomy (SA), is of practical significance: it (a) reduces computational and storage complexity by n-fold for each user, (b) increases the crowdsourcer's revenue by counteracting an effort reservation effect existing in asymmetric contests, and (c) neutralizes the (almost universal) law of diminishing marginal returns (DMR). Through an extensive numerical case study, we demonstrate and scrutinize the superior profitability of our mechanism, as well as draw insights into the SA property.","2155-6814","978-1-4799-6036-1","10.1109/MASS.2014.66","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7035674","Incentive mechanism;all-pay auction;asymmetric contest;strategy autonomy;participatory sensing;network economics","Crowdsourcing;Standards;Bayes methods;Sensors;Cost accounting;Optimized production technology;Nash equilibrium","","23","","35","IEEE","9 Feb 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we investigate the privacy-preserving task assignment in the online scenario, where workers and tasks arrive at the platform in real time and tasks should be assigned to workers immediately. Traditional online task assignments usually make a benchmark to decide the following task assignment. However, when location privacy is considered, the benchmark does not work anymore. Hence, how to assign tasks in real time based on workers and tasks’ obfuscated locations is a challenging problem. Especially when many tasks could be assigned to one worker, path planning should be considered, making the assignment more challenging. To this end, we propose a Planar Laplace distribution based Privacy mechanism (PLP) to obfuscate real locations of workers and tasks, where the obfuscation does not change the ranking of these locations’ relative distances. Furthermore, we design a Threshold-based Online task Assignment mechanism (TOA), which could deal with the one-worker-many-tasks assignment and achieve a satisfactory competitive ratio.

It is particularly challenging to design an incentive mechanism for such a mobile crowd sourcing system, given dynamic smartphones, uncertain arrivals of tasks, strategic behaviors, and private information of smartphones. We propose two truthful auction mechanisms for two different cases of mobile crowd sourcing with dynamic smartphones. For the offline case, we design an optimal truthful mechanism with an optimal task allocation algorithm of polynomial-time computation complexity of O (n+γ)3, where n is the number of smartphones and γ is the number of sensing tasks.

A thematic analysis of responses revealed many benefits: monetary compensation, self-improvement, time management, emotional rewards, and benefits related to the characteristics of micro-tasking. Workers compartmentalized money earned from micro work into different non-fungible mental accounts for different purposes. American and Indian workers differed in non-monetary benefit perceptions.

The results suggest volunteers first engage in activities to support knowledge acquisition and later share knowledge with other volunteers and finally increase participation in Talk through a punctuated process of role discovery.","1530-1605","978-1-4799-7367-5","10.1109/HICSS.2015.196","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7070006","Citizen Science;Legitimate peripheral participation;Motivation;Crowdsourcing","Communities;Planets;Encyclopedias;Electronic publishing;Crowdsourcing","","18","","27","IEEE","30 Mar 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

With rapid advancements in mobile technology, crowd sourcing or participatory sensing can be thought of as a medium by which information can be collected, augmented and used for better planning as well as a mode to deliver real-time information to commuters. In this paper, we conduct an extensive review of both literature and applications using mobile crowd sourcing with a focus on the public transportation domain.

There are multiple efforts by cellular carriers and 5G standardization to leverage the KPIs to minimize drive tests (MDT) and self-organize the network for optimal performance via user feedback. Such an approach accounts for user devices in the field of their operation according to their normal usage and circumvents a number of costs (e.g., manpower, equipment) traditionally covered by the carrier, either directly or through a third party. In this paper, we build a Regional Analysis to Infer KPIs (RAIK) framework to establish a relationship between geographical data and user data using crowdsourced measurements. To do so, we use a neural network and crowdsourced data obtained by user equipment (UE) to predict the KPIs in terms of the reference signal's received power (RSRP) and path loss estimation. Since these KPIs are a function of terrain type, we provide a two-layer coverage map by overlaying a performance layer on a 3-dimensional geographical map. As a result, we can efficiently use crowdsourced data (to not overextend user bandwidth and battery) and infer KPIs in areas where measurements have not or can not be performed. For example, we show that RAIK can use only geographical information to predict the KPIs in areas that lack signal quality data with a negligible mean squared error, a seven-fold reduction in error from state-of-the-art solutions.","1558-2612","978-1-5386-1734-2","10.1109/WCNC.2018.8377405","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8377405","","Buildings;Laser radar;Computational modeling;Loss measurement;Area measurement;Vegetation;Testing","","16","","31","IEEE","11 Jun 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Many commercial MCS platforms have arisen, enabling various novel applications. As crowd workers can be unreliable, a critical issue of these platforms is quality control. Many task assignment approaches have been proposed to increase the quality of crowd sourced tasks by matching workers and tasks in a bipartite graph. However, they fail to apply to MCS platforms where tasks are bound with locations. This paper considers the quality-aware online task assignment problem with location-based tasks. The goal is to optimize tasks' overall quality by assigning appropriate sets of tasks to workers in an online manner. To solve this problem, we propose a probabilistic quality measurement model and a hitchhiking model to characterize workers' behavior. Then we design a polynomial-time online assignment algorithm and prove that the proposed algorithm approximates the offline optimal solution with a competitive ratio of 10/7. Through extensive simulations, we demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our solution.","","978-1-4673-9101-6","10.1109/MASS.2015.40","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7366925","mobile crowdsourcing;online task assignment;location based task","Crowdsourcing;Mobile communication;Silicon;Approximation algorithms;Algorithm design and analysis;Bismuth;Reliability","","15","","27","IEEE","7 Jan 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The necessity for digitizing and storing the information of the heritage of our country is challenging due to sheer scale of cultural data collection and the reliability of sources. These challenges can be overcome by harnessing the present state of art of technologies. Advancement of technology has impacted every area of our social life and the need to document, preserve the ancestral wisdom to pass it down to generations is of prime importance. In this paper, we propose our work on building a fully-fledged web framework using emerging technologies to aid the preservation of cultural heritage site and its related data and to build a Deep Neural Network (DNN) which classifies Heritage sites with the crowdsourced data. We propose an automated crowd-sourcing web application for data management and storage of images collected and a custom deep learning system for transfer learning with an extension for incremental learning. The framework also facilitates transfer learning to retrain the pre-trained DNN architecture for the crowd-sourced data for continuous improvement of the model and initiate back-end jobs for transfer learning. We also demonstrate the crowd-sourcing operations designed with academic hierarchy as reference and show its efficient data storage structure. We also display the extension of the framework as web application to edge devices to accelerate Indian heritage in digital space.

We propose a distributed system architecture for collaborative radio signal monitoring and decoding that builds on $12 low-cost radio frequency (RF) frontends and embedded boards and that takes into consideration the limited network bandwidth from the sensors to the backend. We present a distributed time multiplexing mechanism to sample the spectrum in a coordinated fashion that exploits the similarity of the radio signal received by more than one RF frontend in the same radio coverage. We address the strict time synchronization required among sensors to reconstruct the signal from the samples they receive when in the same radio coverage. We study and implement techniques to identify and overcome errors in the timing information in the presence of noise sources and decode the data in the backend. We provide an evaluation based on simulations and on real signals transmitted by Long-Term Evolution (LTE) base stations.

We describe a design methodology for two types of HITs - the first targets at fast rating of a large number of dialogs regarding some dimensions of the SDS's performance and the second aims to assess the reliability of Workers on MTurk through the variability in ratings across different Workers. A set of approval rules are also designed to control the quality of ratings from MTurk. At the end of the collection work, user judgments for about 8,000 dialogs rated by around 700Workers are collected in 45 days. We observe reasonable consistency between the manual MTurk ratings and an automatic categorization of dialogs in terms of task completion, which partially verifies the reliability of the approved ratings from MTurk. From the second type of HITs, we also observe moderate inter-rater agreement for ratings in task completion which provides support for the utilization of MTurk as a judgments collection platform.

For this vital Internet connection, most current IoT devices use a personal gateway device such as a smartphone or a home WiFi access point. The necessity of configuring and maintaining these gateways presents an additional burden for both users and developers of IoT applications. Our vision for IoT connectivity is to eliminate the need for the personal gateway by developing crowdsourced low-power wide area networks (csLPWAN). Recent technologies such as RPMA, LoRa, and R-FDMA enable links to reach 15km using ISM-band transceivers, making csLPWANs an attractive option. In this paper, we investigate the practicality of csLPWANs and develop the first csLPWAN planning tool, PlanIt, which combines topography-aware RF signal analysis with demographic data to predict LPWAN coverage in specific geographic areas. Using PlanIt, we find that most cities achieve 99% coverage by deploying a single LPWAN base station within the city. To provide better service on the csLPWAN, we propose and evaluate D-QN, a near-optimal MAC protocol to enable efficient bandwidth sharing in highly utilized networks. In the future, csLPWANs could accommodate a heterogeneous set of IoT applications, simplifying the IoT application development cycle, reducing total system cost, improving application reliability, and enhancing the user experience.","2474-249X","978-1-5090-4327-9","10.1109/PERCOM.2017.7917849","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7917849","","Estimation;Urban areas","","13","","22","IEEE","4 May 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The first experiment using this framework enabled 3,268 trackable face videos to be collected and analyzed in under two months. Each participant viewed one or more commercials while their facial response was recorded and analyzed. Our data showed significantly different intensity and dynamics patterns of smile responses between subgroups who reported liking the commercials versus those who did not. Since this framework appeared in 2011, we have collected over three million videos of facial responses in over 75 countries using this same methodology, enabling facial analytics to become significantly more accurate and validated across five continents. Many new insights have been discovered based on crowd-sourced facial data, enabling Internet-based measurement of facial responses to become reliable and proven.

Due to users' heterogeneous resources and service requirements, it is challenging for each user to always accomplish his task satisfactorily. To alleviate this issue, mobile users can exploit the heterogeneity and crowdsource their resources to enhance the task execution performance. In this paper, we propose a general 3C framework that enables mobile users to share all three types of resources through device- to-device connections. Such a framework generalizes many existing 1C/2C resource sharing models (that only shares one or two types of resources among users). To quantify the benefit of the proposed framework, we focus on an energy minimization problem, and show that the 3C framework always achieves a smaller total energy consumption, comparing with other 1C/2C models. Furthermore, we show that the energy reduction is maximized, when user connection probability and content caching ratio are neither too large nor too small. Our numerical results show that, when ignoring device-to-device transmission energy, the general 3C framework can reduce the total energy consumption by 82.98%, comparing with the 1C/2C models.","","978-1-5090-5019-2","10.1109/GLOCOM.2017.8254121","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8254121","","Resource management;Computational modeling;Mobile communication;Device-to-device communication;Delays;Numerical models","","12","","16","IEEE","15 Jan 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
