One way to accelerate the chip design process is to equip designers with early estimations of the circuit metrics without actually running the time-consuming circuit implementation flow. In this paper, we propose a methodology for accurate synthesis results prediction based on deep neural networks. More specifically, reckoning the relevance of circuit metrics during synthesis, we propose to use multi-task learning (MTL) to simultaneously predict circuit delay and area after logic synthesis, given the hardware description language design and the synthesis configuration sequence. A multi-head attention mechanism is developed to allow knowledge sharing between the predictions for delay and area to improve the model performance. Experimental results on 780,000 data points show that the testing mean-absolute-percentage-error (MAPE) on unseen designs can achieve 6%, which is about 3× lower than existing studies. Moreover, we demonstrate that the proposed MTL model can facilitate circuit design space exploration, which can effectively obtain superior designs in terms of area and delay.","","979-8-3503-0955-3","10.1109/MLCAD58807.2023.10299840","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10299840","","Measurement;Solid modeling;Machine learning;Predictive models;Multitasking;Delays;Space exploration","","","","27","IEEE","31 Oct 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This study involved 219 Indonesian workers from a coal mining company whereas the data was analyzed using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modelling (PLS-SEM). The results indicate that while WhatsApp usage at work has significant impact on communication overload, it has no discernible effect on information overload. Furthermore, communication and information overload have a positive impact on job-stress.

Currently, various ontology matching techniques have been proposed, which makes use of different strategies or methods to improve the quality of alignment. Being enlightened by the success of Semi-supervised Learning (SL) in ontology matching domain, this paper further proposes aN aive Bayesian Classifier (NBC) based SL, and use it to obtain high-quality alignment. In particular, our approach first models the ontology matching issue as a binary classification problem; then the Positive and Unlabeled (PU) training set and the negative examples that are determined by it is constructed, which is used to train the NBC; and finally, with the learned knowledge, the complete ontology alignment is obtained.

This paper focuses on an independent division of a major Japanese firm. Most design sections had devised their own sets of regulations thirty years ago and were managed on this basis, with LSI, microcomputers, and software as their key components. Information systems had evolved separately according to the needs of each division, resulting in an unwieldy spaghetti-like database network that privileged manufacturing management over knowledge sharing. Due to the absence of a unified code structure for the entire institution, the storage and exchange of knowledge was hindered. A major step in solving these problems and fostering innovation was the establishment of a ldquokey componentsrdquo section. With the purpose of compiling product development and technological information from each business unit, the ldquokey componentsrdquo would function at the nucleus of operations. This paper focuses on the management strategies of a major Japanese electronics manufacturer in the information and telecommunications industry. It investigates systems for overseeing technology from the development and design stages through production. A key concept is point of design, a mechanism for gathering many types of information automatically, on a permanent basis, from each of the autonomous decentralized sections.

The model considers vehicle dynamics and control variables, such as acceleration and steering angle, and releases the popular assumption that there is full knowledge sharing or cooperation among vehicles at intersections. These features make the proposed framework more realistic compared to previous microsimulation attempts and applicable to traffic flow and environmental impact assessment studies. In addition, it efficiently operates in realtime for multiple vehicles, overcoming the limitations of offline methods.

Thus, we are interested in studying social cognition in human-robot interaction (HRI), notably in improving communication skills relying on joint attention (JA) and knowledge sharing. Since JA involves low-level cognitive processes in humans, we take into account the implications of Moravec’s Paradox and focus on the aspect of knowledge representation. Inspired by 4E cognition principles, we study egocentric localization through the concept of sensory ego-sphere. We propose a neural network architecture named AEGO to model attention for each agent in interaction and show how to fuse information in a common representation space. From the perspective of dynamic fields theory, AEGO takes into account the dynamics of bottom-up and top-down modulation processes and the effects of neural excitatory and inhibitory synaptic interaction. In this work we evaluate the model in simulation and experiments with the robot Pepper in JA tasks based on proprioception, vision, rudimentary natural language and Hebbian plasticity. Results show that AEGO is convenient for HRI, allowing the human and the robot to share attention and knowledge about objects in scenarios close to everyday situations. AEGO constitutes a novel brain-inspired architecture to model attention that is suitable for multi-agent applications relying on social cognition skills, having the potential to generalize to several robotics platforms and HRI scenarios.","2153-0866","979-8-3503-7770-5","10.1109/IROS58592.2024.10802086","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10802086","","Adaptation models;Cognitive processes;Social robots;Robot vision systems;Human-robot interaction;Modulation;Knowledge representation;Brain modeling;Robots;Biological neural networks","","","","26","IEEE","25 Dec 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

FLOSS user/developer community networks serve not only as “learning, reviewing, and testing” environments for developers, but they may also act as innovation networks that contribute to the improvement of the innovative capabilities of individual developers within the community. Therefore, understanding the characteristics, the motivating factors and the innovative dynamics of these developer communities will provide valuable insight into how to improve the innovative capabilities of developing countries in relation to software. The aim of this paper is to explore the characteristics of FLOSS developer communities in order to discover what benefits they may offer developing countries in generating innovative capabilities related to software. By conducting a survey in the FLOSS user/developer community in Turkey, the demographic characteristics, motivation factors and innovative characteristics of the community are explored and the question of whether these communities may act as innovation networks is examined. It is concluded that FLOSS community networks mostly serve as knowledge sharing and collaboration platforms, however, they do have the potential to evolve into innovation networks if they receive support from the local software industry and academic institutions.","2159-5100","978-1-4244-8203-0","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5603302","","Communities;Technological innovation;Linux;Open source software;Programming profession","","","","57","","14 Oct 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, a major challenge in effective prediction is the obvious difficulty of learning both global and local anatomical information from the tumor, due to irregular spatial representations in various MRI data. To address these issues, we construct a hard-parameter-sharing multi-task network for NPC recurrence prediction enhanced by Similarity-Preserving Knowledge Distillation (SPKD) with loss-balanced weighting strategy. In our method, the backbone generates global anatomical information and the auxiliary segmentation task extracts local anatomical information. Besides, through SPKD, the valuable hidden representations of single-task predictive network are distilled into the primary network and ease the negative transfer in the multi-task framework. Furthermore, we explore that the loss-balanced weighting strategy might not only reduce negative transfer but also constrain distillation of over-confidence knowledge, and the proper distilling layers positions in our framework encourage positive learning in specific knowledge-sharing tasks. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed multi-task learning (MTL) framework enhanced by similarity distillation knowledge distillation with loss-balanced weighting algorithm improves the overall performance.","","979-8-3503-4311-3","10.1109/ICHCI58871.2023.10277878","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62273155); Key Laboratory of Autonomous Systems and Network Control; Ministry of Education; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10277878","component;NPC recurrence prediction;knowledge distillation;multi-task learning;loss-balanced weight","Knowledge engineering;Human computer interaction;Magnetic resonance imaging;Transforms;Prediction methods;Multitasking;Prediction algorithms","","","","16","IEEE","17 Oct 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Nowadays, with the large amount of ontologies already available, there is a high demand for reusing the knowledge in existing ontologies. Since ontologies are complex structures, sharing of knowledge coming from various ontologies has become a tedious task. Ontology alignment is a popular knowledge sharing technique that is used to share information between heterogeneous information systems. There are numerous techniques for the alignment of ontologies, and the field still faces many challenges. Due to the inherent nature of multiple relationships among the ontologies, it postulates that the Multi-Agent System technology is a better technology to automate the ontology alignment with little human intervention. This paper presents multi-agent based approach for ontology alignment developed as a plug in for the popular ontological modelling environment known as Protégé. It simulates how different processes interactively operate inside the human mind to perform certain activities intelligently. Indeed, the proposed solution uses agent communication, negotiation, and coordination as the primary method of exploring the semantic relationships between the ontologies. The generated ontology could be used as a shared understanding between information systems that are running on input ontologies. The success of the proposed approach was evaluated by using two ontologies of agricultural domain. It was evident that the system could discover over 70% accurate semantic relationships, and thus, the authors claim that the proposed approach could resolve the complexity in ontology alignment for certain extend.","2164-7011","978-1-4673-2605-6","10.1109/ICIInfS.2012.6304827","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6304827","Autonomous Software Agents;Multi-Agent Systems;Ontology Alignment","Ontologies;Multiagent systems;Humans;Algorithm design and analysis;Semantics;Java;Information systems","","","","20","IEEE","17 Sep 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper presents a novel approach for securely transferring a machine learning model, selected from various algorithms such as linear regression, K-nearest neighbors (KNN), decision tree, and random forest, across distributed systems. Our method involves encrypting the selected model using the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm, while the AES key is encrypted using the ElGamal encryption scheme. This double-layered encryption ensures both the confidentiality of the model and the security of the encryption key during transmission. At the receiver's end, the encrypted model and key are decrypted, enabling predictions to be made using the recovered model. Through this process, the integrity and confidentiality of the transferred model are preserved, thereby mitigating the risk of unauthorized access or tampering. We discuss the implementation details of our approach, including the tools and technologies utilized, as well as the performance evaluation of the encrypted model transfer process. Our findings demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in securely transferring machine learning models between distributed systems, thereby fostering collaboration and knowledge sharing while maintaining data privacy and security.

A digital twin is a virtual replica of a physical object that facilitates real-time data collection from IoT sensors and uses machine learning/artificial intelligence to analyze and predict data. In this paper, we investigate the use case of federated machine learning for analyzing data on digital twins. Since digital twins capture data about their physical counterparts, they may contain private and sensitive information. This poses challenges in performing machine learning tasks on digital twins due to potential data privacy leakage threats. The motivation behind this research is to explore data ownership and privacy issues in the context of the vast amounts of data available in digital twins and to apply federated learning as a potential solution to address these challenges. We investigated how federated learning can enhance the predictive capability of digital twins by promoting knowledge sharing while maintaining privacy. Our findings indicate that federated learning is an effective approach for facilitating learning between twins and can significantly reduce communication overhead in comparison to training on physical edge devices. Additionally, we show that the convergence rate of federated learning on digital twins improves due to the greater amount of training data available on digital twins compared to the baseline federated learning approach.","2576-6813","979-8-3503-1090-0","10.1109/GLOBECOM54140.2023.10437850","Howard University(grant numbers:W911NF-20-2-0277); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10437850","Federated Learning;Digital Twin;IoT","Training;Data privacy;Privacy;Federated learning;Data integrity;Digital twins;Task analysis","","","","15","IEEE","26 Feb 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

An effective transfer of knowledge within the network can create decisive competitive advantages. However, this learning process is often impeded by a lack of knowledge transparency in the network. The Best Practice Sharing (BPS) tool is a data-driven approach to facilitate knowledge sharing by identifying comparable processes across production sites and determining optimization potential through process evaluation. However, the current version of the BPS tool focuses solely on economic criteria for process optimization. To also consider social sustainability aspects, a human-centered perspective on process design is needed. To this end, this paper introduces two extensions to the BPS approach. First, based on a systematic literature review, a framework for characterizing the human role in production processes is developed, which extends the identification of comparable processes. Second, a risk assessment-based analysis approach for the evaluation of processes following human-centered criteria is presented. Here, particular emphasis is placed on identifying suitable methods to assess psychosocial risk factors, using a second systematic literature review. Together, these two extensions pave the way for human-centered BPS in global production networks.","2693-8855","979-8-3503-1517-2","10.1109/ICE/ITMC58018.2023.10332369","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10332369","Internet of Production;cyber-physical system;digital shadow;production network;knowledge transfer","Knowledge engineering;Process design;Technological innovation;Systematics;Bibliographies;Production;Manufacturing","","","","81","IEEE","4 Dec 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

With the emergence of the semantic web and big data, learning domain ontologies from text is becoming a cutting-edge technique as it is an automatic process of deriving ontological knowledge. Specifically, a set of representative concepts and semantic relations can be rapidly derived from unstructured text documents in a hierarchical structure to model a domain. In this paper, we aim at exploiting the ontology learning approach to extract a domain ontology from systems engineering handbooks. An approach is proposed for learning terms, concepts, taxonomic and non-taxonomic relations. By incorporating both linguistic-based and statistical-based natural language processing techniques, we realized an automatic detection of complex domain terms and conceptualized the systems engineering body of knowledge in a semantic fashion. To evaluate the proposed approach, a case study is conducted, wherein the hybrid approach is applied with template-driven and machine learning algorithms. The result shows that the proposed approach has a robust performance in decreasing ontology development costs.

As the company’s revenue model is based on the execution of successful projects, constant employee competency development is crucial to be resilient and maintain a competitive market position. Thus, this paper aims to determine the core digital project management competencies and propose a competence development plan. To achieve this aim, a scientific literature review and a semi-structured interview with project managers were carried out. The results revealed that the most important digital project management competencies are contextual knowledge, planning and communication skills and ability to adapt to a fast-changing environment. It was recommended to implement the following solutions: form an environment conducive to learning, organize internal knowledge-sharing sessions, promote mentoring/job shadowing, use external coaching services, and provide opportunities for the employees to attend professional conferences and online project management courses. These solutions ought to narrow the gap between the available and required digital project management competencies and help in coping with the challenges of rapid technological progress.","2836-7588","979-8-3503-1030-6","10.1109/E-TEMS57541.2023.10424612","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10424612","digital project;digital project management;project management competencies;SME;resilience;Covid19","Pandemics;Project management;Organizations;Planning;Risk management;Interviews;Shadow mapping","","","","24","IEEE","12 Feb 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

On the other hand, social media has enabled several forms of GESI violations, including hate speech, targeted harassment, and discriminatory content. One important solution to face these violations is the challenging behavior of those who violate GESI concepts on social media platforms. While many users may intend to confront and combat such violations, the actual behavior may not always align with these intentions. Accordingly, this study aims to investigate users' challenging intentions and behavior of GESI violations on social media platforms, while focusing on the cultural differences among the UK and Arab. We also investigated the moderating impact of social inclusion on the relationship between intention and behavior regarding challenging violations of GESI. To meet this goal, we deployed a survey among two samples of UK (325) and Arab (312) participants.

However, implementing the FL technique in dynamic networks like the drone network, is challenged by the high communication cost among the clients and slow convergence rate of the global model due to the straggling clients in the network. Moreover, the straggler effect can exacerbate attack propagation in a security network, as attackers might exploit the delay of the intrusion detection model designed in the presence of stragglers. The semi-asynchronous FL (SAFL) method has displayed commendable performance in mitigating the straggler effect. However, existing SAFL techniques do not consider a holistic approach that improves the performance of the global model at a reduced communication cost. This study proposes an agnostic straggler-resilient SAFL (ASR-Fed) algorithm that prioritizes the updates of high-performing and efficient clients while circumventing the updates of straggling clients during the FL process. Simulation experiments performed under different scenarios evaluate the effectiveness of ASR-Fed.

However, each tool has its effects, and for the choice of an appropriate presentation, overall device costs and expected display outcomes must be considered. Despite holographic projection being relatively immature at a technical level, its convenience and uniqueness in delivering stereoscopic imaging without the need for additional devices signifies its value. We explored the prospects and applications of holographic projection in the competitive VR market. With continuous technological development and improvement, holographic projection has the potential to become a core tool for information presentation in various fields. With experimental methods and expert interviews, we proposed the development direction of holographic projection technology. Participants operated three different types of display tools during the experiment: 3D modeling, 2.5D holographic projection, and AR models. After the experiment, interviews were conducted to define questions from diverse perspectives and insights. Subsequently, the responses of interviewees were analyzed to identify issues and development directions. Industry experts were also invited for in-depth interviews and knowledge sharing to consolidate the competitiveness and feasibility of holographic projection in the market. As a result, five key development points for holographic projection technology were determined. (1) Enhancing human-machine interaction, (2) Naked-eye characteristics, (3) Integration with animation technology, (4) Displaying object presentations, and (5) Diversified application scenarios. The research results indicated that, on the display effectiveness aspect, holographic projection is comparable to most virtual head-mounted devices for the majority of users. To enhance market competitiveness, interactivity, interest, environmental adaptability, and diverse technologies need to be considered as development directions.","","979-8-3503-2778-6","10.1109/SSIM59263.2023.10468993","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10468993","holographic projection;design display;AR;VR","Industries;Human computer interaction;Solid modeling;Three-dimensional displays;Costs;Stereo image processing;Social sciences","","","","12","IEEE","22 Mar 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Literature has shown that both tools are important for the application of a STEM approach and have led to good results in an educational environment. To analyse the learning perceptions of educational robotics in a collaborative environment, we have developed a pedagogical approach that relies on collaborative learning through a groupware called IGARA, developed on Moodle platform. Activities made available by the virtual environment were developed based on constructivist, interactionist principles, with task contextualization to enhance students' perception. In order to assess the functionality of such an approach, an exploratory study was carried out with a set of 14 students, divided into 3 groups, spatially distant due to Covid-19 pandemic safety measures.

Using a combined theoretical lens of the process/knowledge continuum and boundary spanning, this research analyses an interesting case of BP ownership found in a real-life healthcare organization. Our results show that knowledge-intensive BPs, at least in the case organization, do require a different type of BP ownership than the one found in the BPM literature published over the past two decades.

Various open-source materials on cryptosystems based on finite automata were studied, leading to the consideration of a new concept termed finite automata cryptography. This concept represents a fusion of cryptography and automata theory. The paper explores the process of constructing an ontological model for the theory of finite automata cryptosystems. Employing ontology aids in standardizing terminology and formalizing knowledge within this domain. To organize knowledge about cryptosystems that utilize the concepts of finite automata theory, the decision was made to adopt an ontology-based approach. This promotes uniformity in the understanding of concepts and methods among researchers and practitioners. The proposed ontology can be employed for training and knowledge sharing in the field of finite automata cryptography, thereby facilitating the transfer of experience and knowledge between professionals, students, and other interested parties.","","979-8-3503-5444-7","10.1109/IVIT62102.2024.10692774","Ministry of Education; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10692774","ontology;conceptual map;finite automata;cryptography;cryptosystem","Training;Visualization;Terminology;Reviews;Automata;Information security;Pressing;Ontologies;Mathematical models;Cryptography","","","","29","IEEE","2 Oct 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Differential privacy mechanisms are widely utilized in federated learning to ensure privacy for clients, and the magnitude of the clipping threshold directly impacts model utility. The current research does not adequately address the impact of model accuracy and training loss on clipping thresholds and is challenged by excessive hyperparameter adjustments. In response to these challenges, we propose an adaptive clipping-based differential privacy federated learning algorithm named AdaDP-CFL. It achieves model personalization and facilitates knowledge sharing among different groups through clustering and regularization techniques. Subsequently, the algorithm addresses the issue of adaptive clipping for various clients, formulated as a Markov decision process, by utilizing a deep deterministic policy gradient model based on gradient differences across client groups. Experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms current algorithms in accuracy, effectively balancing privacy protection and model utility.","2766-8568","979-8-3503-5012-8","10.1109/IWQoS61813.2024.10682882","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10682882","personalized federated learning;data heterogeneity;sample-level differential privacy;adaptive clipping","Training;Adaptation models;Differential privacy;Privacy;Accuracy;Federated learning;Markov decision processes","","","","27","IEEE","26 Sep 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we consider the problem of knowledge management in collaborative data analytics and present ShareAL, an integrated knowledge management platform, as a solution to that problem. The ShareAL platform consists of three core components: a full stack web application, a dashboard for analyzing streaming data and a High Performance Computing (HPC) cluster for performing real time analysis. Prior research has not applied knowledge management to collaborative analytics or developed a platform with the same capabilities as ShareAL. ShareAL overcomes the barriers data scientists face to collaboration by providing intuitive sharing of data and analytics via the web application, a shared computing environment via the HPC cluster and knowledge sharing and collaboration via a real time messaging application.","","978-1-7281-7647-5","10.1109/iThings-GreenCom-CPSCom-SmartData-Cybermatics50389.2020.00113","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9291625","Knowledge Management;Knowledge Management Systems;Knowledge Sharing;Collaborative Analytics","Collaboration;Knowledge management;Tools;Monitoring;Data analysis;Real-time systems;Faces","","","","29","IEEE","28 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Traditional approaches for sharing and analysing VANET data centrally could compromise individual privacy and expose users to various security risks such as position falsification, man-in-the middle attacks and data poisoning attacks. To address these privacy challenges, a secure Federated Learning (FL)-based privacy preserving in V2V communications is proposed. FL is a decentralized machine learning that allows multiple vehicles to collectively build a global model while storing the data on their devices. It facilitates model training without sharing raw data, thereby mitigating privacy risks and ensuring confidentiality. To ensure data integrity and security during the FL process, cryptographic technique is incorporated to detect and mitigate the model poisoning and data poisoning attacks.

It is unclear how different characteristics and degrees of user engagement in social media might impact the performance of content moderation. In addition, the efficiency of content moderation has not been addressed by prior studies. This study aims to fill these research gaps by investigating the characteristics of user engagement behavior in social media and developing automated models to support content moderation that leverage a state-of-the-art pre-trained model for text analysis. The evaluation results with Reddit data suggest that the directivity and temporal characteristics of user engagement have significant effects on the effectiveness of content moderation. Additionally, leveraging the entire history of user engagement tends to be inefficient or even impractical, yet our findings provide evidence and a guide for improving the efficiency of content moderation using user engagement data without compromising model effectiveness.

"Document Cycles: Knowledge Flows in Heterogeneous Healthcare Information System Environments","C. Osterlund; R. J. Boland","Syracuse University, USA; Case Western Reserve University, USA",2009 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences,"20 Jan 2009","2009","","","1","11","The paper expands our theoretical and empirical understanding of knowledge flows in heterogeneous information system environments. Through an ethnographic study of a U.S. based teaching hospital it was found that doctors and nurses organize a hodgepodge of information systems, some electronic, other paper-based or wall mounted into circular patterns. The data allows a description of how these cyclical organized systems oscillate between documents that address a broader and narrower configuration of participants, times, places and content. In doing so, organizational members continuously adjust their system use to meet the level of background knowledge held by their collaborators, that is, how intimately their collaborators know the context and the routine work practices at hand. The cyclical organization of information systems does not prevent breakdowns in knowledge sharing. To avert such problems each cycle starts and ends with a dialog and reflection among collaborators.","1530-1605","978-0-7695-3450-3","10.1109/HICSS.2009.166","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4755657","","Medical services;Information systems;Collaborative work;Education;Hospitals;Reflection;Mobile communication;Safety;Costs;Large-scale systems","","","","33","IEEE","20 Jan 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
