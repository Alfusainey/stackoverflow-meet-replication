"The mechanism of patient knowledge empowerment through digital health communities","V. Vainauskienė; R. Vaitkienė","School of Economics and Business, Kaunas University of Technology, Kaunas, Lithuania; School of Economics and Business, Kaunas University of Technology, Kaunas, Lithuania",2021 IEEE International Conference on Technology and Entrepreneurship (ICTE),"29 Oct 2021","2021","","","1","6","medical innovations created and developed in the context of digital transformation have already led to better public health, including hygiene, prevention of infectious diseases, and accurate diagnosis. Despite the wide scale of medical innovation and the activity of researchers, inventors, and developers of effective medical solutions, the number of people with chronic diseases has been constantly growing, and this is a challenge for health systems around the world. A key requirement for patients to be able to self-manage their disease is patient empowerment. People become empowered to independently take decisions to manage the disease as well as to be in charge of it, mainly when they possess knowledge about their illness and can employ it in making such decisions. One of the vital steps for successful patient empowerment to manage their chronic disease is the possibility to access virtual communities of patients and to engage in their activities.The field of research on digital health communities is characterized by the research gap: patient health communities are not seen as enabling patient knowledge to self-manage their disease; therefore, the approach that patient health communities do not operate in isolation from the patient empowerment process, but are part of that process that encourages patients to evolve to the highest level of empowerment is not being developed. Motivators, barriers, and enablers of knowledge sharing specific to patient knowledge empowerment through digital communities are also not explored. Failure to disclose these aspects does not allow for understanding the patient knowledge empowerment through digital health communities. As a result of scientific literature analysis, a holistic model is presented that reveals what knowledge sharing motivators and enablers operate at each level of patient empowerment.","","978-1-6654-3895-7","10.1109/ICTE51655.2021.9584741","European Social Fund; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9584741","patient knowledge;empowerment;digital health communities;knowledge sharing","Technological innovation;Analytical models;Infectious diseases;Digital transformation;Conferences;Entrepreneurship;Electronic healthcare","","","","35","IEEE","29 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We develop an ontology that covers architectural knowledge concepts in Stack Overflow. The ontology provides a description of architecture-relevant information to represent and structure architectural knowledge in Stack Overflow. The ontology is empirically grounded through qualitative analyses of different Stack Overflow posts, as well as inter-coder reliability tests.

To find help, programmers often take to online question-and-answer forums such as Stack Overflow to start discussion threads about the errors they encountered.Aims: We conjecture that information from Stack Overflow threads which discuss compiler errors can be automatically collected and repackaged to provide programmers with enhanced compiler error messages, thus saving programmers' time and energy.Method: We present Pycee, a plugin integrated with the popular Sublime Text IDE to provide enhanced compiler error messages for the Python programming language. Pycee automatically queries Stack Overflow to provide customised and summarised information within the IDE. We evaluated two Pycee variants through a think-aloud user study during which 16 programmers completed Python programming tasks while using Pycee.Results: The majority of participants agreed that Pycee was helpful while completing the study tasks. When compared to a baseline relying on the official Python documentation to enhance compiler error messages, participants generally preferred Pycee in terms of helpfulness, citing concrete suggestions for fixes and example code as major benefits.Conclusions: Our results confirm that data from online sources such as Stack Overflow can be successfully used to automatically enhance compiler error messages.

Traditionally, the assessments are conducted in laboratories in controlled conditions and following international standards like ITU-T Rec.P.800. However, even before the current pandemic, more speech quality research used crowdsourcing-based approaches for collecting subjective ratings. Crowdsourcing allows researchers to collect data even without a dedicated test laboratory, to collect data from a huge and diverse group of participants, and to perform the assessment in various real-life settings. Still, this approach raises questions about the reliability and validity of the subjective ratings, especially when comparing the ratings with data collected in standardized procedures. One step to approach these challenges was the development of the ITU-T Rec.P.808 standard. This standard helps practitioners implement best practices from speech quality studies and crowdsourcing studies in their crowdsourced speech quality assessments. However, even with the ITU-T Rec.P.808 in action, it is unclear how much background knowledge is necessary to successfully “implement” this standard. Therefore, this paper aims to assess the data quality differences between two P.808 implementations. One implementation is from a co-author of the P.808 standard, and the other is a researcher with only a little background in crowdsourcing and speech quality assessments. Both implementations are used in a large-scale crowdsourcing study with about two hundred users from Amazon Mechanical Turk. The collected ratings are compared to gold-standard data from a certified laboratory. Also, the two implementations are compared to analyze whether they lead to the same conclusions. The results show that both implementations correlate strongly with the laboratory and with each other. Thus, suggesting that the ITU-T Rec.P.808 is robust enough to be implemented by non-experts in speech evaluation or crowdsourcing.","2472-7814","978-1-6654-8794-8","10.1109/QoMEX55416.2022.9900894","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9900894","speech quality assessment;crowdsourcing;subjective test;P.808","Crowdsourcing;Pandemics;Data integrity;Laboratories;Robustness;Quality assessment;Standards","","1","","18","IEEE","4 Oct 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

While most existing studies show that increasing incentives tend to benefit crowdsourcing outcomes, i.e. broader participation and higher worker performance, some reported inconsistent observations. In addition, there is the lack of investigation in the domain of software crowdsourcing. To that end, this study examines the extent to which task pricing strategies are employed in software crowdsourcing. More specifically, it aims at investigating the impact of pricing strategies on worker's behaviors and performance. It reports a conceptual model between pricing strategies and potential influences on worker behaviors, an algorithm for measuring the effect of pricing strategies, and an empirical evaluation on 434 crowdsourcing tasks extracted from TopCoder. The results show that: 1) Strategic task pricing patterns, i.e. under-pricing and over-pricing are prevalent in software crowdsourcing practices; 2) Overpriced tasks are more likely to attract more workers to register and submit, and have higher task completion velocity; 3) Underpriced tasks tend to associate with less registrants and submissions, and lower task completion velocity. These observations imply that task requesters can typically get their extra dollars investment paid-off if employing proactive task pricing strategy. However, it is also observed that it appears to be a counter-intuitive effect on the score of final deliverable. We believe the preliminary findings are helpful for task requesters in better pricing decision and hope to stimulate further discussions and research in pricing strategies of software crowdsourcing.","","978-1-4503-5733-3","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8445787","crowdsourcing;task award;pricing strategy;worker behaviors;worker performance","Task analysis;Pricing;Crowdsourcing;Software;Predictive models;Atmospheric measurements","","","","18","","26 Aug 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Existing privacy laws impose strict requirements concerning the right to be forgotten for data used in training AI models. In federated crowdsourcing services, the right to be forgotten is guaranteed through federated unlearning. Current federated unlearning solutions encompass a two-step process: first, eliminating model updates associated with the target data to achieve unlearning, followed by retraining among the remaining clients to restore the performance of federated crowdsourcing services. However, this indiscriminate removal of model updates, while safeguarding the privacy of the target data, also greatly undermines the generalization performance of the global model. Moreover, relying on client-side retraining imposes additional economic costs on the federated crowdsourcing service. To tackle the above issues, this paper proposes an efficient federated unlearning framework for federated crowdsourcing services, which is based on adaptive parameter clipping and data-free distillation. We first compute the Fisher information matrix (FIM) to approximate the correlation between the target data and all model parameters, which is utilized to adaptively clip each parameter of the global model. Then, we model the softmax layer of the global model to synthesize pseudo-samples, enabling the retrain process on the crowdsourcing platform for the recovery of generalization performance. We conducted extensive experiments on three datasets, and the results demonstrate that our proposed framework not only possesses outstanding data removal capability but also outperforms the comparison methods in terms of computation time and storage space.","2836-3868","979-8-3503-6855-0","10.1109/ICWS62655.2024.00094","National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10707496","Federated crowdsourcing services;Federated Unlearning;Fisher Information Matrix;Data-free Knowledge Distillation","Crowdsourcing;Training;Adaptation models;Privacy;Data privacy;Web services;Biological system modeling;Computational modeling;Training data;Data models","","","","22","IEEE","15 Oct 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Despite recent advancements in the areas of machine learning and data mining, there are still areas where human effort cannot be easily replicated by software systems. The rise of crowdsourcing systems such as Amazon Turk help fills this void by enabling the mobilization of human effort for large-scale computing tasks. Like many new techniques or systems, crowdsourcing systems are a double-edged sword capable of being used for either ""good"" or ""evil."" In this talk, I will take a closer look at the impact of crowdsourcing on the security of web-services. I will focus on both positive and negative implications of crowdsourcing systems for the future. First, I will discuss how crowdsourcing can help us address difficult problems in dealing with fake online identities in online social networks. I will describe recent work studying crowdsourced Sybil detection, using a large user study and several ground-truth datasets of fake and real users. Results show that in the right conditions, human workers can be highly accurate in identifying real and fake identities. In fact, we can build scalable systems for crowdsourced Sybil detection, and data from user studies show that it can provide highly accurate results with very low cost. Second, I will discuss the negative implications of crowdsourcing, and describe a detailed measurement study on malicious ""crowdturfing"" systems, where users sign up to perform tasks such as spreading rumors, writing fake reviews, and creating fake online identities. Through both large scale data measurements and experiments, our study shows that these systems are highly scalable, and growing exponentially in both jobs and revenue, and pose a new type of threat to the security of today's online communities.","","978-1-4577-1114-5","10.1109/ICTer.2011.6075038","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6075038","Android;Wireless Networks;Distributed Databases","","","","","","IEEE","10 Nov 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Recently, due to the burgeoning smartphone industry and the surging demand for sensing data, a new mobile computing and sensing paradigm called mobile crowdsensing has emerged and has created significant momentum in both industry and academia. Pivotal to the viability of all such crowdsourcing systems, is whether there is enough incentive to attract sufficient participation. Many crowdsourcing scenarios are heterogeneous in the sense that, not only the workers types (e.g., abilities and costs) are different, but the beliefs (probabilistic knowledge) about their respective types are also different. In this talk, we design an incentive mechanism for such scenarios using an asymmetric all-pay contest (or auction) model. Our design objective is an optimal mechanism, i.e., one that maximizes the crowdsourcing revenue minus cost. To achieve this, we furnish the contest with a prize tuple which is an array of reward functions for each potential winner (worker). We prove and characterize the unique equilibrium of this contest, and solve the optimal prize tuple. In addition, this study discovers a counter-intuitive property, strategy autonomy (SA), which means that heterogeneous workers behave independently of one another as if they were in a homogeneous setting. In the second part of the talk, we propose the use of Tullock contests as an alternative framework to design incentive mechanisms for crowdsourcing. We explore a new dimension of optimal Tullock contents design by provisioning the prize as a function. We are inspired by the conduciveness of Tullock contests to attracting user entry in other domains. In this talk, we explore a new dimension in optimal Tullock contest design, by superseding the contest prize-which is fixed in conventional Tullock contests-with a prize function that is dependent on the (unknown) winners contribution, in order to maximize the crowdsourcers utility. We show that this approach leads to several attractive practical advantages.","","978-1-5090-1941-0","10.1109/PERCOMW.2016.7457099","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7457099","","Crowdsourcing;Mobile communication;Sensors;Australia;Mobile computing;Conferences;Industries","","","","","IEEE","21 Apr 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A major approach is to select a best worker for a task. Many of the existing studies on a task allocation in crowdsourcing assume a 'push' crowdsourcing model where the system can decide which tasks are sent to a worker. On the other hand, a task allocation problem for a 'pull' crowdsourcing model such as Amazon Mechanical Turk has not been sufficiently studied. To tackle this issue we try to employ the price discrimination theory in microeconomics. However, the theory assumes the unlimited supply of resources, which does not fit the crowdsourcing situation and is difficult to apply directly. To overcome this difficulty, we provide a model of price discrimination for task allocation in crowdsourcing and give an efficient method for calculating the optimal payment setting. Furthermore, we evaluate the proposed method by using the data obtained from MTurk experiments and show it performs well.","","978-1-4673-9618-9","10.1109/WI-IAT.2015.158","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7397364","","Resource management;Crowdsourcing;Probabilistic logic;Linear programming;Cost accounting;Birds","","","","6","IEEE","4 Feb 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Thus far, automatic malware analysis systems have relied on labeled training data and analyst defined rules to identify malware samples' software features and functional categories. Such approaches require substantial expert analyst effort to maintain, as malware authors change programming languages, APIs, malicious tactics, and operating system targets. In this paper we present preliminary results demonstrating the viability of a new research direction for malware capability identification that addresses these issues, the concept of mining web technical documentation to automatically identify malware capabilities. This approach does not require expert generation of rules or training labels and automatically stays up to date with the latest software engineering trends. We make two contributions aimed at demonstrating the value of this research direction: first, with a corpus of 6 million web technical postings from the programming question and answer website StackOverflow.com, we show that symbols found in a corpus of malicious executable files, such as registry keys, file names, and API call names, also occur frequently in the StackOverflow data, suggesting that applying natural language processing to the StackOverflow posts (and other technical documents) may help us automatically generate characterizations of technical symbols, and, thereby, capabilities, found in malware. Our second contribution is to show that by analyzing function call symbol co-occurrence within StackOverflow posts, as well as the semantic tags associated with these posts, we can create function relationship graphs over the symbols which show promise in helping to identifying malware software capabilities. We argue that these early findings demonstrate the promise of a web technical document based approach to automating malware capability identification.","2332-5666","978-1-4799-3248-1","10.1109/ICDCSW.2013.56","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6679853","computer security;data mining;malware analysis;natural language processing;machine learning;statistical modeling","Malware;Webcams;Data mining;Programming;Internet;Clustering algorithms","","5","","9","IEEE","12 Dec 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To perform a specific task, there is usually a large number of libraries that offer the desired functionality. Unfortunately, selecting the appropriate library to use is not straightforward since developers are often unaware of the advantages and disadvantages of each library, and may also care about different characteristics in different situations. In this paper, we introduce the idea of using software metrics to help developers choose the libraries most suited to their needs. We propose creating library comparisons based on several metrics extracted from multiple sources such as software repositories, issue tracking systems, and Q&A websites. By consolidating all of this information in a single website, we enable developers to make informed decisions by comparing metric data belonging to libraries from several domains. Additionally, we will use this website to survey developers about which metrics are the most valuable to them, helping us answer the broader question of what determines library quality. In this short paper, we describe the metrics we propose in our work and present preliminary results, as well as faced challenges.","","978-1-4503-5662-6","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8444833","software library;software metrics;application programming interfaces;mining software repositories;assisted developer support","Measurement;Computer bugs;Software;Software libraries;Task analysis;Cryptography","","4","","16","","23 Aug 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Although code examples on those forums are good starting points, they are often incomplete and inadequate for developers' local program contexts; adaptation of those examples is necessary to integrate them to production code. As a consequence, the process of adapting online code examples is done over and over again, by multiple developers independently. Our work extensively studies these adaptations and variations, serving as the basis for a tool that helps integrate these online code examples in a target context in an interactive manner. We perform a large-scale empirical study about the nature and extent of adaptations and variations of SO snippets. We construct a comprehensive dataset linking SO posts to GitHub counterparts based on clone detection, time stamp analysis, and explicit URL references. We then qualitatively inspect 400 SO examples and their GitHub counterparts and develop a taxonomy of 24 adaptation types. Using this taxonomy, we build an automated adaptation analysis technique on top of GumTree to classify the entire dataset into these types. We build a Chrome extension called ExampleStack that automatically lifts an adaptation-aware template from each SO example and its GitHub counterparts to identify hot spots where most changes happen. A user study with sixteen programmers shows that seeing the commonalities and variations in similar GitHub counterparts increases their confidence about the given SO example, and helps them grasp a more comprehensive view about how to reuse the example differently and avoid common pitfalls.","1558-1225","978-1-7281-0869-8","10.1109/ICSE.2019.00046","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8812028","online code examples;code adaptation","Cloning;Taxonomy;Java;Tools;Programming;Software engineering;Production","","20","","68","IEEE","26 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Tagging of the questions is particularly useful for indexing information based on the tags. Currently, a user enters the tag manually for a question asked by him/her. The question should contain at least one tag manually typed by the user. It can be seen that most of the questions asked should either have more tags associated with it or aren't tagged accurately and appropriately. Since there are a huge number of tags, the process of searching through all the tags manually and find relevant ones can be cumbersome and is therefore overlooked by most of the users asking the questions. This research is focused on exploring methods for developing an autonomous tagging system using Machine learning methods like k-Nearest Neighbors and Random Forest along with some crucial data preprocessing steps like Stemming, Tokenization and removing Stop words. The dataset for the above research is taken from kaggle.com which has a 10% Stackoverflow question dataset open for all. The results of the following proposed system for automatic tagging were satisfactory. Random Forest gave an average percentage accuracy of 70% across all the tags while k-Nearest Neighbors performed slightly better giving an accuracy of 75%.","","978-1-7281-8041-0","10.1109/ISCV49265.2020.9204309","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9204309","Machine Learning;Automatic Question Tagging;k-Nearest Neighbors;Random Forest;Natural Language Processing","Forestry;Tagging;Feature extraction;Data models;Java;Task analysis;C# languages","","3","","10","IEEE","23 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Although most libraries have API reference documentation, it is not easy to find appropriate APIs due to the lexical gap and knowledge gap between the natural language description of the programming task and the API description in API documentation. Here, the lexical gap refers to the fact that the same semantic meaning can be expressed by different words, and the knowledge gap refers to the fact that API documentation mainly describes API functionality and structure but lacks other types of information like concepts and purposes, which are usually the key information in the task description. In this paper, we propose an API recommendation approach named BIKER (Bi-Information source based KnowledgE Recommendation) to tackle these two gaps. To bridge the lexical gap, BIKER uses word embedding technique to calculate the similarity score between two text descriptions. Inspired by our survey findings that developers incorporate Stack Overflow posts and API documentation for bridging the knowledge gap, BIKER leverages Stack Overflow posts to extract candidate APIs for a program task, and ranks candidate APIs by considering the query's similarity with both Stack Overflow posts and API documentation. It also summarizes supplementary information (e.g., API description, code examples in Stack Overflow posts) for each API to help developers select the APIs that are most relevant to their tasks. Our evaluation with 413 API-related questions confirms the effectiveness of BIKER for both class- and method-level API recommendation, compared with state-of-the-art baselines. Our user study with 28 Java developers further demonstrates the practicality of BIKER for API search.","2643-1572","978-1-4503-5937-5","10.1145/3238147.3238191","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9000025","API Recommendation;API Documentation;Stack Overflow;Word Embedding","","","83","","51","","17 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We first collect candidate API classes from Stack Overflow using pseudo-relevance feedback and two term weighting algorithms, and then rank the candidates using Borda count and semantic proximity between query keywords and the API classes. The semantic proximity has been determined by an analysis of 1.3 million questions and answers of Stack Overflow.

We first built a prototype that can be stocked with a dataset of comparable API methods and provides tool-tips to users in search results and in API documentation. We conducted a user study with this tool based on a dataset of TensorFlow comparable API methods spanning 198 hand-annotated facts from Stack Overflow posts. This study confirmed that providing comparable API methods can be useful for helping developers understand the design space of APIs: developers using our tool were significantly more aware of the comparable API methods and better understood the differences between them. We then created SOREL, an comparable API methods knowledge extraction tool trained on our hand-annotated corpus, which achieves a 71% precision and 55% recall at discovering our manually extracted facts and discovers 433 pairs of comparable API methods from thousands of unseen Stack Overflow posts.

In the post-pc era, where smartphones dominate the personal computing market offering both constant mobility and large amounts of spatiotemporal sensory data, crowdsourcing is becoming increasingly popular. In this context, crowdsourcing stands as the only viable solution for collecting the large amount of location-related network data required to support location-based services, e.g., the signal strength radiomap of a fingerprinting localization system inside a multi-floor building. However, this benefit does not come for free, because crowdsourcing also poses new challenges in radiomap creation. We focus on the problem of device diversity that occurs frequently as the contributors usually carry heterogeneous mobile devices that report network measurements very differently. We demonstrate with simulations and experimental results that the traditional signal strength values from the surrounding network infrastructure are not suitable for crowdsourcing the radiomap. Moreover, we present an alternative approach, based on signal strength differences, that is far more robust to device variations and maintains the localization accuracy regardless of the number of contributing devices.","","978-1-4799-4043-1","10.1109/IPIN.2013.6817906","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6817906","crowdsourcing;localization;device diversity","Performance evaluation;Noise;Standards;Estimation;Radio navigation;Mobile handsets;Fingerprint recognition","","52","2","29","IEEE","19 May 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Method: This process begins with identifying 13 influencing factors in software crowdsourcing failures, across four categories including task characteristics, technology popularity, competition network, and workers reliability. Presenting an algorithm to construct worker competition network and extract its network metrics features. The proposed framework was evaluated on 4,872 software crowdsourcing tasks, extracted from TopCoder platform, using five machine learners, compared with in-house TopCoder predictor. Results: 1) Workers reliability, links in the description, number of registered workers, number of required technologies, and task-workers network modularity are the most influencing factors for predicting crowdsourcing failure; 2) The top-three learners for task failure are Naïve Bayes, Random Forest, and StackingC, with precision above 98.8%, recall above 81.2%, and F-measure above 91.2%; and 3) The proposed best learners significantly outperform the two baseline models in our evaluation.

This deep rootedness of ICT in the city & its citizens has resulted in ICT to become truly pervasive and with the great influx of RFID tags, sensor networks, location sensors, cameras it has become as widespread as it possibly can. Crowdsourcing right from when it came to the fore has been seen as a distributed problem solving process which helps the crowd to get involved, participate and in most cases arrive at a well-defined solution. A city is basically its people, so if technology is able to use the species of its creators so as to create a socio-technical human then we may well possibly call it as the result of crowdsourcing work in smart city. Now, time has come when this relation needs a closer look and apt infrastructure and environment should be set up so as to enable citizens to be not a symbolic but a real art of the city.

It is a form of collective intelligence to work on software engineering tasks, from requirement extraction to testing. In the most common crowdsourcing model, a client (a firm or some type of institution) first broadcasts the task/project, which is intended to be developed, via a crowdsourcing platform. Each task/project has a prize and a deadline. Then, members of the platform community/crowd/individuals select the tasks that they want to submit solutions, either individually or in a collaborative manner. The submitted solutions are evaluated by the crowdsourcing platform and the most successful one is remunerated by the initiating organization. The prize of each task may be determined in terms of the expected duration of the task, its complexity, its quality, the required effort to complete, and the online reputation of the client. TopCoder awarding mechanism, performance-based, game theory-based, deadline driven or revenue sharing models are several approaches for determining task prizes in crowdsourced software development (CSD). In this paper, Putnam model, a well-known software effort estimation model, is proposed to be applicable as a prize determination approach in crowdsourcing. The demonstrative examples are chosen from TopCoder projects, and Function Point Analysis is used to calculate expected effort of the projects.","","978-1-7281-1929-8","10.1109/EECS.2018.00089","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8910031","Prize modeling;crowdsourced software development;award determination;software cost","Crowdsourcing;Software;Task analysis;Complexity theory;Estimation;Computer languages;Productivity","","1","","19","IEEE","25 Nov 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Data that do not meet certain criteria set by the crowdsourcer are also submitted by the crowd in a crowdsourcing initiative due to its openness. Thus, there is a need to ensure that only valid data are being captured before the data are being processed further. However, manually validating the data is not practical due to the high volume of data involved in crowdsourcing and their unpredictable nature. Therefore, in this research, an automated algorithm to validate crowdsourced data was developed. The objective was to identify the processes needed to enable the validation of crowdsourced data to be performed automatically. Two types of validation were included; task validation and worker validation. Kuder-Richardson Formula 20 was used to compute validity of task and mean formula converted to percentage was used in computing worker validity. The algorithm was implemented by embedding it in a prototype crowdsourcing application called AsnafCircle that crowdsourced information on eligible asnaf (alms recipient) from the public. Evaluation showed that the algorithm was able to automatically compute values that determine task and worker validity. Evaluation by experts also conformed the necessity of the processes that constitute the algorithm. The presence of this algorithm will help to ensure validity of contributed data in crowdsourcing initiatives, hence, improving their reliability.","","978-1-5386-9175-5","10.1109/SCORED.2018.8711108","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8711108","crowdsourcing;crowdsourcer;data validation;valid data;algorithm;automated;validity;reliability","Task analysis;Crowdsourcing;Reliability;Interviews;Bibliographies;Conferences;Research and development","","1","","21","IEEE","13 May 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

That is the case of biological collections (biocollections), where the metadata (Darwin-core Terms) found in digitized labels are transcribed by citizen scientists. In this paper, we present an approach to reduce the number of crowdsourcing tasks required to obtain the transcription of the text found in biocollections' images. By using an ensemble of Optical Character Recognition (OCR) engines - OCRopus, Tesseract, and the Google Cloud OCR - our approach identifies the lines and characters that have a high probability of being correct. This reduces the need for crowdsourced transcription to be done for only low confidence fragments of text. The number of lines to transcribe is also reduced through hybrid human-machine crowdsourcing where the output of the ensemble of OCRs is used as the first ""human"" transcription of the redundant crowdsourcing process. Our approach was tested in six biocollections (2,966 images), reducing the number of crowdsourcing tasks by 76% (58% due to lines accepted by the ensemble of OCRs and about 18% due to accelerated convergence when using hybrid crowdsourcing). The automatically extracted text presented a character error rate of 0.001 (0.1%).","","978-1-7281-2451-3","10.1109/eScience.2019.00020","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9041743","OCR;Optical Character Recognition;Crowdsourcing;Biocollections;Ensemble;Hybrid;Information Extraction;Text Extraction;Human-machine","","","1","","33","IEEE","19 Mar 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To achieve good service quality for a crowdsourcing system, incentive mechanisms are necessary to attract more user participation. Most of existing mechanisms apply only for the crowdsourcing scenario where the platform user will employ the workers to perform certain tasks to maximize one's utility with budget constraint. However, the budget is not fixed in practice, and the final goal for the platform user is to achieve profit maximization. In this paper, we consider a more general optimization objective for the budget-free platform user, profit maximizing, i.e., the difference between her utility and the total reward to the participants. We study the problem of how to maximize the profit in a crowdsourcing activity where the platform user's proceeds is a symmetric submodular demand valuation function and the users' cost information are prior-free. Based on the framework of random sampling and profit extraction, we propose a mechanism which is computationally tractable, truthful, individually rational and constant-factor competitive to the optimal profit omniscient single-price auction in a fixed market. We also extend the profit extract algorithm to the online case. By this work, we enrich the class of competitive auctions by considering a more general optimization objective and a more general demand valuation function in both the offline and online platform for the crowdsourcing system.","","978-1-7281-1141-4","10.1109/BDCloud.2018.00023","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8672283","Profit maximization;crowdsourcing;mechanism design","Crowdsourcing;Task analysis;Cost accounting;Optimized production technology;Pricing;Sensors","","1","","17","IEEE","21 Mar 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Requesters from different backgrounds on the network put their requests on the crowdsourcing platform and hand them to non-professionals from different fields to complete, which not only saves working time, but also greatly reduces the economic cost. However, with the increase of crowdsourcing tasks and the expansion of platforms, the task information of crowdsourcing platforms tends to be abundant and redundant, which makes workers face the problem of information overload. It is very difficult to match the tasks they need from thousands of tasks. Therefore, task-based recommendation system emerges as The Times require, which can help workers quickly select the tasks they want to do from the massive tasks. However, there are still some problems in the current task recommendation system. For example, the existing task recommendation system tends to recommend simple and easy common tasks to workers, while the exposure probability of those complex and difficult tasks is greatly reduced, so exposure bias appears in the task recommendation system. Deviation brings great hidden dangers to crowdsourcing platforms. For example, complex tasks are hidden in the long tail for a long time and no one pays attention to them, so the task completion rate will be greatly reduced and the satisfaction of requesters will also be reduced. In this paper, an unbiased task recommendation method based on causal graph analysis is proposed to remove the bias in task recommendation system and make tasks better match.","","978-1-6654-6297-6","10.1109/DASC/PiCom/CBDCom/Cy55231.2022.9927762","Qufu Normal University; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9927762","crowdsourcing;recommendation;bias;causal graph","Crowdsourcing;Costs;Tail;Big Data;Task analysis;Recommender systems;Faces","","","","18","IEEE","13 Dec 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Answers and Stack Overflow, represent a well-known example of collective intelligence. The existing CQA systems, despite their overall successfulness and popularity, fail to answer a significant amount of questions in required time. One option for scaffolding collaboration in CQA systems is a recommendation of new questions to users who are suitable candidates for providing correct answers (so called question routing). Various methods have been proposed so far to find appropriate answerers, but almost all approaches heavily depend on previous users' activities in a particular CQA system (i.e. QA-data). In our work, we attempt to involve a whole community including users with no or minimal previous activity (e.g. newcomers or lurkers). We proposed a question routing method which analyses users' non-QA data from a CQA system itself as well as from external services and platforms, such as blogs, micro-blogs or social networking sites, in order to estimate users' interests and expertise early and more precisely. Consequently, we can recommend new questions to a wider part of a community as well as more accurately. Evaluation on a dataset from Stack Exchange platform showed that considering non-QA data leads not only to better recognition of users with low activity as suitable answerers, but also to higher overall precision of the recommendations. It implies that non-QA data can supplement QA data during expertise estimation in question routing and thus also improve a success rate of a questions answering process.","","978-1-4503-3854-7","10.1145/2808797.2809331","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7403532","community question answering;question routing;question recommendation;non-qa data;expertise estimation","Routing;Knowledge discovery;Blogs;Collaboration;Estimation;Social network services;Search engines","","4","","23","","11 Feb 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we aim to answer these questions from the perspective of the voting outcome by the site users. Our key observation is that the voting score of an answer is strongly positively correlated with that of its question, and such correlation could be in turn used to boost the prediction performance. Armed with this observation, we propose a family of algorithms to jointly predict the voting scores of questions and answers soon after they are posted in the CQA sites.

In this paper, we propose a novel question answering attention network (QAAN) for investigating the role of the paired answer of questions for classification. Specifically, QAAN studies the correlation between question and paired answer, taking the questions as the primary part of the question representation, and the answer information is aggregated based on similarity and disparity with the answer.

We refer to these kinds of online media which help software engineers improve their performance in software development, maintenance and test processes as software information sites. It is common to see tags in software information sites and many sites allow users to tag various objects with their own words. Users increasingly use tags to describe the most important features of their posted contents or projects. In this paper, we propose TagCombine, an automatic tag recommendation method which analyzes objects in software information sites. TagCombine has 3 different components: 1. multilabel ranking component which considers tag recommendation as a multi-label learning problem; 2. similarity based ranking component which recommends tags from similar objects; 3. tag-term based ranking component which considers the relationship between different terms and tags, and recommends tags after analyzing the terms in the objects. We evaluate TagCombine on 2 software information sites, StackOverflow and Freecode, which contain 47,668 and 39,231 text documents, respectively, and 437 and 243 tags, respectively. Experiment results show that for StackOverflow, our TagCombine achieves recall@5 and recall@10 scores of 0.5964 and 0.7239, respectively; For Freecode, it achieves recall@5 and recall@10 scores of 0.6391 and 0.7773, respectively.

In this work we expand the understanding of such issues (or the so called ""violations"") hidden in code snippets written in JavaScript, the programming language with the highest number of questions on StackOverflow. To characterize the violations, we extracted 336k code snippets from answers to JavaScript questions on StackOverflow and statically analyzed them using ESLinter, a JavaScript linter. We discovered that there is no single JavaScript code snippet without a rule violation. On average, our studied code snippets have 11 violations, but we found instances of more than 200 violations. In particular, rules related to stylistic issues are by far the most violated ones (82.9% of the violations pertain to this category). Possible errors, which developers might be more interested in, represent only 0.1% of the violations.

Practical issues and problems one could face while learning or implementing new concepts are a means of establishing such relevance. In this paper, we propose a method to automatically augment learning material with practical questions about the concept being learnt. We use questions and answers from StackOverflow, a leading social Questions and Answers (Q&A) website to augment an electronic textbook interface, thus connecting the concepts being taught to the real world. For achieving this automatically, we first mine the textbook content to locate words and phrases which are likely to be the most important concepts on each page of the textbook. We then select only those words and phrases which appear as ‘tags’ in StackOverflow, typically defined by users while asking and answering questions. Using permutations of these tags as queries, we query the StackOverflow database to obtain relevant questions and answers to augment any given page. We present an interface to augment textbooks with such questions using the aforementioned method. We also present the results of a student survey examining the effectiveness of the augmentation in establishing relevance to their learning.","","978-1-4799-8454-1","10.1109/FIE.2015.7344369","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7344369","Computer Science Education;e-learning;Relevance;Questions;StackOverflow;Augmentation","Databases;Education;Programming profession;Joining processes;Software","","3","","34","IEEE","7 Dec 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, this has also led to a number of issues, such as the dissemination and dissemination of hate speech. This new problem of hate speech on social media has been addressed by recent studies that utilized a number of feature engineering techniques and machine learning algorithms. It's not clear if there is a study that compares different methods for generating features and machine learning algorithms in order to determine which one is better for a standard publicly available dataset. With the support vector machine technique, the testing findings showed that bigram features performed best with 79 percent overall accuracy when utilized with the bigram feature set. Detecting automated hate speech messages can be made easier with the findings of our investigation.

One of the knowledge management (KM) cornerstones is improving productivity by effective knowledge sharing and transfer. However, from the game theory perspective, the main constraint is that people tend not to collaborate in uncertainty conditions, when collaborative behavior is not guaranteed, and sharing knowledge is time- and effort-consuming. Therefore, KM must be a practical aspect of the general organizational culture. Specifically, software development is a knowledge-intensive activity and its success depends heavily on the developers' knowledge and experience. In this presentation we highlight how the agile approach initiates a culture change that is in line with the culture change needed for a KM initiative. We discuss KM enablers that are embedded in the agile software engineering approach, and illustrate how collaborating processes and knowledge transparency can weaken the dilemmas people face and lead to better knowledge extraction and sharing.","","978-1-4244-3712-2","10.1109/CHASE.2009.5071412","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5071412","","Knowledge management;Programming;Educational products;Educational technology;Collaboration;Uncertainty;Employee rights;Laboratories;Industrial engineering;Asset management","","25","","22","IEEE","12 Jun 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The communication in this context scales to not only between machine to machine but also between a large number of heterogeneous entities and persons. This genius technology of Internet of Things holds paramount importance and application in healthcare technologies. Considering health technologies, a large number of devices generate huge amount of data related to a patient. Assimilating the data from heterogeneous sources and using it to generate intelligence is one of the primary tasks in a smart environment. In the context of eHealth, Internet of Things is of immense importance since connected data about patient would facilitate treatment with more efficiency and comprehensive knowledge. Virtually storing the patient data and making it ubiquitously accessible to concerned healthcare personnel would be the first step toward mutual knowledge sharing. Another important aspect of using this connected data is the design of an intelligent clinical decision support system which would assist the doctors in every possible way during the treatment phase. A model has been proposed with an inclusive approach of Internet of Things in eHealth scenario for a smart medical environment and providing ubiquitous services at its best. Several issues pertaining to the system has also been discussed accordingly. Nevertheless, the enormous spread of Internet of Things for efficient and intelligent healthcare services holds quite inevitable.

In dense deployment, video nodes typically demonstrate a significant spatio-temporal correlation. To overcome these obstacles in current approaches, this paper introduces CONVINCE, a new approach to look at the network cameras as a collective entity that enables collaborative video analytics pipeline among cameras. CONVINCE aims at 1) reducing the computation cost and bandwidth requirements by leveraging spatiotemporal correlations among cameras in eliminating redundant frames intelligently, and ii) improving vision algorithms' accuracy by enabling collaborative knowledge sharing among relevant cameras.

Their objectives are to appropriately react to current context situation over the web, rather than in a single machine. This requires exchanging the context of extremely dynamic web environment, as well as reasoning about the context to achieve goal. Thus, context representation and context reasoning play significant roles. This paper presents an ontology-based approach to: 1) employing web ontology language (OWL) to describe context knowledge, and 2) using semantic web rule language (SWRL) to represent rule-based inference rules for context reasoning. OWL describes context knowledge in details by defining relationships among knowledge. As an XML-based language, OWL enjoys good interoperability for knowledge sharing and reuse over the web. Further, SWRL represents rule-based first-order logic (FOL) inference rules, which are expressed in terms of predefined OWL taxonomic context knowledge. By doing so, SWRL rules perfectly integrate with OWL, making it easy to develop and maintain application systems. Besides, as SWRL is also XML-based, it is not so dependent upon inference engine. That is, inference engine can be changed without rewriting the rules for engine-specific syntax. This enhances system maintainability.","","978-1-4244-6249-0","10.1109/CNSR.2010.22","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5489369","Web Ontology Language (OWL);Semantic Web Rule Language (SWRL);Context Reasoning","Ontologies;OWL;Engines;Knowledge representation;Logic;Context-aware services;Context;Ubiquitous computing;Surveillance;Semantic Web","","16","","13","IEEE","21 Jun 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Agile software development has put a new focus on the question of how to share knowledge among members of software development teams. In contrast to heavy-weight, document-centric approaches, agile approaches rely on face-to-face communication for knowledge transfer. Pair programming is one such practice with the idea to share the work specific knowledge across the development teams through pair rotation.

We describe and discuss a globally distributed agile project at DNV GL Software, a multinational provider of software for a safer, smarter and greener future in the energy, process and maritime industries. DNV GL Software is headquartered in Norway. The project is distributed across two locations with 12 team members in Norway and three testers in China. In a distributed agile team with little overlap in working hours the challenge is to coordinate tasks and test activities in a way that makes coordination and communication efficient. DNV GL Software believes in including the remote testers as part of the agile team, enabling self-managing, cross-functional virtual teams that are capable of taking the full responsibility for implementing and verifying one entire feature. To support the communication between testers in China and the rest of the team in Norway, the team needs a shared understanding of the goal of a release and how to collaborate. We conducted interviews with the team and representatives from different roles in the organization, and we performed retrospectives with the team. In this article we describe how continuous testing based on continuous and frequent feedback ensures knowledge sharing and safeguarding the quality of the system under development. We found the following enablers for a successful virtual agile team: coordination by mutual adjustment, dedicated testers and low turnover, shifting working hours, and self-management and autonomy. Non-technical factors, such as socio-technical and organizational factors, have a significant influence on the way software testing is performed in an agile virtual team.

In addition, battery storage technologies offer solutions to a range of network problems which are weak, long and thin, have large load variations, and have low power system inertia. The network problems may also be associated with fringe-of-grid areas that are likely to experience reliability and power quality issues. In addition, as the penetration of renewable energy resources increases, further problems also emerged primarily related to the intermittency of such resources. This paper aims to address the battery storage technologies in the light of a complete system topology while presenting a broader view about the future trends. Since their interactions in an ever growing complexity of microgrid applications need special attention, main emphasis is also given to highlight the impact of renewable energy utilising battery storage solutions. Finally, the energy storage test system developed is explained to provide insight to accelerate the technology by real tests on system components and applications, knowledge sharing and training.","","978-1-5090-5200-4","10.1109/ICSET.2016.7811821","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7811821","power network problems;battery storage system;battery storage applications;intermittent power sources;battery storage test system","Batteries;Renewable energy sources;Power system stability;Safety;Power generation;Generators","","14","","5","IEEE","16 Jan 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Presence or lack of trust can have serious implications for organizations with respect to the quality and of their business processes. Several scientific works have confirmed the direct correlation between social-cognitive capital, in terms of competencies and experiences, and a feeling of trust in both learning and working collaborative environments. On the other hand, Competency-Based Management allows organizations to link human resources processes to competencies in order to shape its workforce capabilities and to achieve better results. Typically, employees' competencies (and proficiency levels) are stored and used by specific enterprise software, whereas the trust is not considered or left to managers' feeling. This work proposes an approach to the improvement of collaborative learning activities by refining and allowing (at workers' level) competency-finding processes through the social calculus of trust-in-competencies degree.","2161-377X","978-1-61284-209-7","10.1109/ICALT.2011.102","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5992357","corporate learning;trust;competency-based management;semantic web;social networking","Context;Social network services;Ontologies;Organizations;Calculus;Semantic Web;Resumes","","14","","10","IEEE","18 Aug 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The first step is to make it “perceive” the outside world, so extracting knowledge from some data sources such as sensors is crucial. More critically, there is a fundamental need for a standard that would enable knowledge sharing/exchanging among the different entities, e.g., between on-board sensors, in-vehicle controls and traffic management agencies. This paper proposes an Ontology for Context Modelling (OCM) to be used as the world model for driving context representation and reasoning, which can enable a better understanding of traffic context and sensor capability, which is the basis for providing data source to Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS), V2X (Vehicle-to-Everything) communications and even driving decision making within autonomous vehicles. Through the experiments, we evaluate the capability of the OCM to represent the driving context and the reasoning mechanism to compensate for sensor failures and recognize lane changing and overtaking events. This methodology has significant value for creating standards in autonomous and semi-autonomous cars.","2153-0017","978-1-5090-1889-5","10.1109/ITSC.2016.7795524","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7795524","","Vehicles;Sensors;Ontologies;Context;Roads;Cognition;Context modeling","","11","","14","IEEE","26 Dec 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
