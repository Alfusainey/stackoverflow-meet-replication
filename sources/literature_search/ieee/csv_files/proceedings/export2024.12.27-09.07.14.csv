One of the most important technical challenges of crowdsourcing is quality control of workers' responses. Human factors play a key role in achieving high quality answers in crowdsourcing-based solving tasks. The most major factor is pertained to the uncertainty of workers about the responses that they provide to resolve the task at hand. On the other hand, workers may have diverse levels of expertise and skill. It is then important to take into account both the degrees of uncertainty and expertise to return the most correct reliable answer. In this paper, we propose a belief functions-based approach to achieve this goal. We conduct also some comprehensive experiments to validate the effectiveness of our proposal.","","978-1-5090-4492-4","10.1109/NAFIPS.2016.7851590","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7851590","","Crowdsourcing;Uncertainty;Reliability;Data models;Decision making;Human factors;Computational modeling","","4","","17","IEEE","13 Feb 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Unfortunately, treating mobile devices as simple sensors that generate raw sensing data may lead to low efficiency because of excessive bandwidth occupation and additional computation resource consumption. In this paper, we integrate crowdsourcing into existing mobile cloud framework such that data acquisition and processing can be conducted in a uniform platform. We consider a dynamic network where mobile devices may join and leave the network at any time. To deal with the challenges of sensing and computation task assignment in such a dynamic environment, we propose an online algorithm with the objective of minimizing the total cost including sensing, processing, communication and delay cost. Extensive simulations are conducted to demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can significantly reduce the total cost of crowdsourcing.","","978-1-4799-3088-3","10.1109/INFCOMW.2014.6849258","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6849258","","Mobile communication;Sensors;Mobile handsets;Cloud computing;Crowdsourcing;Heuristic algorithms;Data acquisition","","3","","28","IEEE","8 Jul 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However most of the existing incentive mechanisms for the crowdsourcing has focused on how to allocate tasks to the participants to maximize the social welfare, and none of them consider the problem of participant coverage hole created by the uneven distribution of participants. In this paper, we propose a market-based incentive mechanism for crowdsourcing, where the platform motivates the participants to move to the coverage hole and complete the sensing tasks there from a market-based perspective. The market-based incentive mechanism is built on a novel reverse auction framework with reserve price, where the reserve price of a sensing task is the maximum payment for a participant to complete this task. The platform systematically reduces the reserve price of tasks in popular areas and participants are stimulated to complete the tasks in unpopular areas. Each round of reverse auction consists of a winning participant selection problem and a payment determination problem. Since the task allocation problem is NP-hard, we propose a greedy algorithm to solve it. We also design a critical payment policy to guarantee that participants declare their cost truthfully. Evaluation results show that the proposed mechanism outperforms existing solutions under various conditions.","1938-1883","978-1-5386-3180-5","10.1109/ICC.2018.8422389","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8422389","","Task analysis;Sensors;Crowdsourcing;Smart phones;Electronic mail;Resource management;Greedy algorithms","","2","","20","IEEE","30 Jul 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Among all topics over spatial crowdsourcing platforms, pricing method study is a fundamental one. The pricing strategy largely influences the incentives of workers and the revenue of platforms. The existing studies only consider the pricing strategy for users, but ignore the pricing to workers. They usually use a fixed percentage multiplied the price by to pay the workers given by users which neglect the status of the workers. However, the expectation price of the workers is also important. On one hand, if the payment to the workers is too high, the platform will reduce the revenue. On the other hand, if the payment to the workers is too low, the workers would reduce their enthusiasm to serve the spatial crowdsourcing tasks, leading to low quantity and quality of completed tasks. In order to balance the platform’s revenue and the worker’s enthusiasm, we propose a dynamic pricing method based on workers' expectation. Specifically, we consider three factors that may affect the worker’s pricing, which are the historical pricing law, the current working time of workers, and the price of the most recent orders. Through extensive experiments on real datasets, we show that our pricing method can improve both the revenue of the platforms and the ratio of completed orders, which means that it can well balance the interests of the platform and the interests of the workers.","2831-5944","978-1-6654-5450-6","10.1109/ICDSBA57203.2022.00087","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10129491","Spatial crowdsourcing;pricing strategy;monta carlo sampling algorithm;data analysis;data processing","Crowdsourcing;Monte Carlo methods;Heuristic algorithms;Psychology;Pricing;Data science;Software","","1","","16","IEEE","23 May 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

When estimating answers, WMCE algorithm assigns diverse weight to submitted answers of workers based on their quality while MCE algorithm assigns identical weight to submitted answers of all workers. For a fixed worker population, we reveal that the increase in task redundancy1 can improve accuracy of estimated answers but such improvement is limited within a certain level. We further show that WMCE algorithm can reduce the influence of this limitation better than MCE algorithm for the same crowdsourcing system. Simulation results validate our theoretical analysis and show that WMCE algorithm outperforms MCE algorithm in the accuracy of estimated answers.","1930-529X","978-1-4799-3512-3","10.1109/GLOCOM.2014.7037221","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7037221","","Correlation;Inference algorithms;Algorithm design and analysis;Redundancy;Crowdsourcing;Accuracy;Labeling","","1","","13","IEEE","12 Feb 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Requesters share tasks that they are unable to solve, and workers perform these tasks based on their expertise. In today's digital world, privacy is a major concern for users of this platform. Most workers prefer to keep their personal information, such as age, location, and interests, private. Additionally, ensuring that workers receive rewards after completing their tasks is another reason for participating in crowdsourcing. However, traditional crowdsourcing requires a third party to send the rewards to workers, which can be unreliable and destructive. Therefore, most workers prefer platforms that guarantee protection of their privacy and full payment of their rewards. In this article, we use blockchain technology and smart contracts based on Ethereum to eliminate the need for an unreliable third party and make workers fully assured that they will receive their full rewards. In addition, we improve worker privacy protection using encryption algorithms and show that worker privacy can be largely protected by a feature-based encryption algorithm with a ciphertext policy.","","979-8-3503-9969-1","10.1109/ICWR57742.2023.10138995","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10138995","Crowdsourcing;Smart contract;Ethereum;privacy preserving;CP-ABE","Crowdsourcing;Privacy;Costs;Smart contracts;Encryption;Blockchains;Task analysis","","","","17","IEEE","5 Jun 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Therefore, distribution system operators (DSOs) are increasingly implementing photographs taken by site technicians as part of their asset management processes and documentation. For example, photographs are used for installation quality assurance as well as for maintenance management during a component's lifespan. However, network maintenance inspection cycles to get these photographs are typically several years and it's not economically and resourcefully viable to send a site technician to a component just for a photograph. Thanks to mobile phone development everyone has a high-quality camera in their pocket and in most cases DSO's secondary substations and distribution cabinets are reachable by the public. Therefore, taking the photographs can be crowdsourced to the public. To succeed in crowdsourcing, it must be fun and motivating for a large group of people to participate. This paper presents a concept for crowdsourcing network maintenance inspections with a mobile game app called EleniaGO. The paper also describes how the photographs taken by the players are integrated to a DSO's asset management processes and systems and how the photographs are analyzed by utilizing artificial intelligence. In addition, the paper reveals how the game provides a new innovative way for a DSO to engage with its customers. The crowdsourcing concept can be broadened to different utility or business sectors and countries to source pictures of relevant business objects.","","978-1-83953-855-1","10.1049/icp.2023.0252","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10267437","","","","","","","","29 Sep 2023","","","IET","IET Conferences"

The industry requires a real time method for the timely processing of the extensive number of applicants for short-term small loans. Owing to the vast number of applications, manual verification is not a viable option. In cooperation with a microloan company in Azerbaijan, we have researched automated risk assessment using crowdsourcing. The principal concept behind this approach is the fact that a significant amount of information relating to a particular applicant can be retrieved from the social networks. The suggested approach can be divided into three parts: First, applicant information is collected on social networks such as LinkedIn and Facebook. This can only occur with the applicant's permission. Then, this data is processed using a program that extracts the relevant information segments. Finally, these information segments are evaluated using crowdsourcing. We attempted to evaluate the information segments using social networks. To that end, we automatically posted requests on the social networks regarding certain information segments and evaluated the community response by counting “likes” and “shares”. For example, we posted the status, “Do you think that a person who has worked at ABC Company is more likely to repay a loan? Please “like” this post if you agree.” From the results, we were able to estimate public opinion. Once evaluated, each information segment was then given a weight factor that was optimized using available loan-repay test data provided to us by a company. We then tested the proposed system on a set of 400 applicants. Using a second crowdsourcing approach, we were able to confirm that the resulting solution provided a 92.5% correct assessment, with 6.45% false positives and 11.11% false negatives, with an assessment duration of 24 hours.","","978-1-4799-5604-3","10.1109/SNPD.2014.6888682","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6888682","Crowdsourcing Social Networks;Risk Assessment;Microloans","Crowdsourcing;LinkedIn;Facebook;Risk management;Data mining;Companies","","","","16","IEEE","1 Sep 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

One approach to this problem is using extreme multi label classification (XMLC) to predict the topic (or “tag”) of a post from a potentially very large candidate label set. While previous work has trained these models on data which has explicit text-to-tag information, we assess the classification ability of embedding models which have not been trained using such structured data (and are thus “unsupervised”) to assess the potential applicability to other forums or domains in which tag data is not available.We evaluate 14 unsupervised pre-trained models on 0.1% of all StackOverflow posts against all 61,662 possible StackOverflow tags. We find that an MPNet model trained partially on unlabelled StackExchange data (i.e. without tag data) achieves the highest score overall for this task, with a recall score of 0.161 R@1. These results inform which models are most appropriate for use in XMLC of StackOverflow posts when supervised training is not feasible. This offers insight into these models’ applicability in similar but not identical domains, such as software product forums. These results suggest that training embedding models using in-domain title-body or question-answer pairs can create an effective zero-shot topic classifier for situations where no topic data is available.","","978-1-4503-9343-0","10.1145/3528588.3528652","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9808734","machine learning;developer forums;natural language processing;zero shot classification;text embedding","Training;Conferences;Data models;Software;Task analysis;Software engineering","","4","","47","","30 Jun 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We contrast three data cleaning approaches: standard NLP, title only, and software task extraction. We evaluate the quality of the each corpus for MT. To provide indicators of how useful each corpus will be for machine translation, we provide researchers with measurements of the corpus size, percentage of unique tokens, and per-word maximum likelihood alignment entropy. We have used these corpus cleaning approaches to translate between English and Code [22, 23], to compare existing SMT approaches from word mapping to neural networks [24], and to re-examine the ""natural software"" hypothesis [29]. After cleaning and aligning the data, we create a simple maximum likelihood MT model to show that English words in the corpus map to a small number of specific code elements. This model provides a basis for the success of using StackOverflow for search and other tasks in the software engineering literature and paves the way for MT.

Concerns about the security implications of this trend have been raised. Developers are now weighing the benefits and risks of LLMs against other relied-upon information sources, such as StackOverflow (SO), requiring empirical data to inform their choice. In this work, our goal is to raise software developers’ awareness of the security implications when selecting code snippets by empirically comparing the vulnerabilities of ChatGPT and StackOverflow. To achieve this, we used an existing Java dataset from SO with security-related questions and answers. Then, we asked ChatGPT the same SO questions, gathering the generated code for comparison. After curating the dataset, we analyzed the number and types of Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) vulnerabilities of 108 snippets from each platform using CodeQL. ChatGPT-generated code contained 248 vulnerabilities compared to the 302 vulnerabilities found in SO snippets, producing 20% fewer vulnerabilities with a statistically significant difference. Additionally, ChatGPT generated 19 types of CWE, fewer than the 22 found in SO. Our findings suggest developers are undereducated on insecure code propagation from both platforms, as we found 274 unique vulnerabilities and 25 types of CWE. Any code copied and pasted, created by AI or humans, cannot be trusted blindly, requiring good software engineering practices to reduce risk. Future work can help minimize insecure code propagation from any platform.","2770-8411","979-8-3503-5487-4","10.1109/SPW63631.2024.00014","National Science Foundation; North Carolina State University; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10579524","Software Engineering Security;Empirical Study;Large Language Models;Software Supply Chain;Code Generation","Java;Privacy;Codes;Generative AI;Supply chains;Chatbots;Market research","","","","56","IEEE","4 Jul 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, irrespective of the difficulty of a question, the contributor of an accepted answer is awarded with the same 'reputation' score, which may demotivate an user's additional efforts to answer a difficult question. To facilitate a question difficulty aware rewarding system, this study proposes SOQDE (Stack Overflow Question Difficulty Estimation), a supervised learning based Question difficulty estimation model for the StackOverflow. To design SOQDE, we randomly selected 936 questions from a SO datadump exported during September 2017. Two of the authors independently labeled those questions into three categories (basic, intermediate, or advanced), where conflicting labels were resolved through tie-breaking votes from a third author. We performed an empirical study to determine how the difficulty of a question impacts its outcomes, such as number of votes, resolution time, and number of votes. Our results suggest that the answers of a basic question receive more votes and therefore would generate more reputation points for an answerer. Due to less incentives relative to efforts spent by an answerer, intermediate and advanced questions encounter significantly more delays than the basic questions, which further validates the need of a model like SOQDE. To build our model, we have identified textual and contextual features of a question and divided them into two categories-pre-hoc and post-hoc features. We observed a model based on Random Forest achieving the highest mean accuracy (67.6%), using only answer-independent pre-hoc features.

To study how programmers reuse code on SO during project development, we conduct a comprehensive empirical study. First, to capture the development activities of pro-grammers, we collect 342,148 modified code snippets in commits from 793 open-source Java projects, and these modified code can reflect the programming problems encountered during development. We also collect the code snippets from 1,355,617 posts on SO. Then, we employ CCFinder to detect the code clone between the modified code from commits and the code from SO, and further analyze the code reuse when programmer solves a programming problem during development. We count the code reuse ratios of the modified code snippets in the commits of each project in different years, the results show that the average code reuse ratio is 6.32%, and the maximum is 8.38%. The code reuse ratio in project commits has increased year by year, and the proportion of code reuse in the newly established project is higher than that of old projects. We also find that some projects reuse the code snippets from many years ago. Additionally, we find that experienced developers seem to be more likely to reuse the knowledge on SO. Moreover, we find that the code reuse ratio in bug-related commits (6.67%) is slightly higher than that of in non-bug-related commits (6.59%). Furthermore, we also find that the code reuse ratio (14.44%) in Java class files that have undergone multiple modifications is more than double the overall code reuse ratio (6.32%).","2643-7171","978-1-4503-9298-3","10.1145/3524610.3527923","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61902441,61902105,61976061); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9796272","Stack Overflow;Code Reuse;GitHub;Code Clone;Software Development;Code Commit","Java;Codes;Cloning;Programming;Open source software","","3","","49","","22 Jun 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Developers in all around the world encounter many problems daily and their trial-and-error experiences to resolve the problems are accumulated in the code change history. The extracted source code differences are expected to provide valuable information to developers before the questions and answers are posted on SO. In our study, we focus on the usage of APIs as the topic of SO articles, because many developers are interested in API programming and suffer from the problems related to API usage. We extracted 4,780 code differences from 713 repositories of Android applications (F-Droid). As a result, we found that 64% of SO articles on Android APIs are related to code differences, whereas 44% of code differences are related to SO articles. Not a few code differences appear before the corresponding SO articles are actually posted. The median of time lag between the first appearance of code changes and the first actual SO postings is 22 months.","","978-1-7281-8913-0","10.1109/QRS51102.2020.00066","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9282283","Stack Overflow;Code Change History;Android SDK;API usage","Natural languages;Software quality;Programming;Software reliability;History;Security;Problem-solving","","","","39","IEEE","11 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Cloud computing is widely used for the services such as analyzing crowdsourced data and application implementation over the IoT. Nowadays, every country and human are prone to natural and artificial disasters. Early detection about disasters such as earthquakes, fire, storms, and floods can save thousands of people's life and effective preventive measure can be taken for the public safety. All the crowdsourced data which are providing the information of a certain geographic region are analyzed in a cloud platform. But, by the time the crowdsourced data makes its way to the cloud for analysis, the opportunity to act on it might be gone. Moreover, thousands of people's life will be lost. Therefore, fog computing is the new and efficient way to analyze such critical crowdsourced IoT data of disasters. In this paper, in order to detect and take necessary steps for public safety during a disaster, we propose a crowdsourcing-based disaster management using fog computing (CDMFC) model in IoT. Further, we also proposed a data offloading mechanism for our CDMFC model to send disaster-related IoT data to the fog even if a direct link to the fog is not available. Our proposed CDMFC model and its data offloading mechanism can detect real-time disasters and disseminate early information for public safety as compared to the conventional cloud computing based disaster management models.","","978-1-5090-4607-2","10.1109/CIC.2016.074","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7809745","Crowdsourcing;Cloud;Disaster;Fog Computing;Internet of Things;Management","","","41","","19","IEEE","9 Jan 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

One such initiative is personalized messaging using mobile applications as a potential tool contributing to obesity prevention and management. In order to achieve this, there are challenges that need to be considered first including the accurate estimation of calories of meals and individuals' calorific intakes using a smartphones. There is also a lack of evidence indicating whether novices, peers and family members can provide accurate tailored feedback on calorie intake and nutrition. The two study objectives were i. To determine the feasibility of experts in nutrition and non-experts accurately identifying calories of meals from photographs as taken on a smartphone; and ii. To inform the development a personalized messaging system for obesity prevention and management using a mobile application. This study was an experimental design using a quantitative online survey with 24 participants, consisting of 12 experts in nutrition and/or dietetics, and 12 non-experts. The non-expert group attended a training session and both groups completed an online survey. The survey consisted of 15 meals, the participants were required to view the photographs and then answer the following question for each photograph: “From viewing the above photograph, enter the number of calories you consider is in this meal? ___Kcal OR ___KJ”. Crowdsourcing was used. The results revealed that the percentage difference between the estimated calories count in the meals against the actual number of calories was on average +55% (SD 79.9) for the non-expert group and +8% (SD 15.1) for the expert group (t-test, P<;0.001). When using crowdsourcing, aggregating opinions from experts and also non-experts improves accuracy. The mode estimate from a crowd of experts is more accurate than 79% of individual experts. The crowd of non-experts' average median difference out performed 63% of individual non-experts. Thus the crowd of non-experts is more accurate in estimating calories from photographs taken on a smartphone than most individuals. When designing a personalized messaging system for obesity prevention and management using a mobile application, a crowd of experts in nutrition and also a crowd of non-experts should be included to estimate calories in foods from photographs taken on a smartphone. This may have potential in contributing to obesity prevention and management, which warrant further research.","","978-1-4673-6799-8","10.1109/BIBM.2015.7359959","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7359959","smartphones;crowdsourcing;obesity;nurition","Obesity;Mobile communication","","13","","6","IEEE","17 Dec 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This type of MCS is called Collaborative MCS (CMCS). Previous CMCS approaches have mainly focused only on the aspect of team skills maximization. Other team formation studies on social networks (SNs) have only focused on social relationship maximization. In this paper, we present a hybrid approach where requesters are able to hire a team that, not only has the required expertise, but also is socially connected and can accomplish tasks collaboratively. Because team formation in CMCS is proven to be NP-hard, we develop a stochastic algorithm that exploit workers knowledge about their SN neighbors and asks a designated leader to recruit a suitable team. The proposed algorithm is inspired from the optimal stopping strategies and uses the odds-algorithm to compute its output. Experimental results show that, compared to the benchmark exponential optimal solution, the proposed approach reduces computation time and produces reasonable performance results.","","978-1-7281-4058-2","10.1109/ICM48031.2019.9021910","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9021910","Team formation;stochastic;odds algorithm;mobile crowdsourcing;IoT","Task analysis;Crowdsourcing;Recruitment;Collaboration;Complexity theory;Social network services;Probabilistic logic","","9","","10","IEEE","5 Mar 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

They are useful for several applications such as location fixing, navigation, access control, and evaluating network coverage and performance. In this paper, we propose a method to build RSS maps by crowdsourcing RSS data, GPS locations, from participating mobile devices. The proposed system gives different weights to each data point provided by the participating devices based on the data source’s trustworthiness. Our tests showed that the different models of mobile devices return GPS location with different location accuracies.

Here, we evaluate the feasibility of using crowdsourcing from untrained workers as a viable modality for large-scale data annotation. This pilot study evaluates the accuracy and usage viability of crowdsourced kidney segmentations. 42 CT scans were labeled by 72 users on the Robovision AI platform and their submissions averaged. Primary validation was conducted by comparing the crowd's submissions to reference segmentations. Crowdsourced segmentations and expert-labeled segmentations were then used individually and together as training data for separate CNN models. We found that the performance of the model trained on crowdsourcing data (Dice score = 0.904 ± 0.026) was not significantly different (P = 0.50) compared to the performance of the expert-labeled model (Dice Score = 0.885 ± 0.112).

However, at least two persons are required for each lane to obtain a high level of accuracy, because the counting is done in real time. As a result, work cost is high and reducing cost while maintaining the same level of accuracy is a problem. As a cost reduction measure that addresses that problem, the use of crowdsourcing for measuring traffic is proposed and the usefulness of that measure is examined. Specifically, an evaluation of accuracy when data is acquired by an unspecified large number of workers shows that the proposed method can reduce survey cost while maintaining the same accuracy as the existing method by eliminating unproductive time. The results demonstrate the feasibility of applying crowdsourcing, which uses human processing capability as opposed to big data processing.","","978-1-7281-1282-4","10.1109/ICBDA.2019.8712831","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8712831","crowd sourcing;Amazon Mechanical Turk;traffic survey","Task analysis;Crowdsourcing;Cameras;Real-time systems;Roads;Computers;Big Data","","4","","10","IEEE","13 May 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It is hard to track and report incidents of human trafficking to the concerned authorities, due to the complex nature of this crime. This paper introduces a crowdsourcing approach to report incidents of human trafficking, using a mobile application. Crowdsourcing is the practice of obtaining information from a large number of people. Information about human trafficking incidents reported using this mobile application is forwarded to the concerned authorities of the country where the crime has been reported. A user can also upload crime scene photos and provide details of the crime location using Global Positioning System. The mobile application introduced in this paper currently focuses on top ten countries which have the highest rates of human trafficking in the world, while very basic support for the rest of the countries. Since the process of reporting human trafficking incidents to the authorities can be complex, time consuming and dangerous, the mobile application allows users to stay anonymous. The aim of this mobile application is to create huge impact in the fight against human trafficking, by using the collective power of the crowd to report incidents of human trafficking. Also, a section of the mobile application is dedicated to educating the user about basic knowledge of human trafficking, its types and measures taken by various governments to fight against it.","","978-1-5386-3004-4","10.1109/UPCON.2017.8251063","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8251063","Human Trafficking;Humanitarian Technology;Crowdsourcing;Mobile application","Androids;Humanoid robots;Mobile applications;Portals;Government;Electronic mail;Mobile communication","","4","","18","IEEE","11 Jan 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The main objective of our research is to capture the essential features of TopCoder projects and introduce a new approach to evaluate the quality for each TopCoder project. This paper makes two major contributions: First, we model the effort level using intrinsic properties of contest and validate the definition.

A promising alternative, that has shown great interest in recent years, is the use of crowdsourcing using mobile phones. In this work we propose a crowdsourcing system that aims to find the available and most suitable parking options for users in a smart city. We have developed ParkForU, a parking-matching and price-regulator algorithm. ParkForU, unlike existing approaches where a large unfiltered number of parking possibilities is given to the users, provides the best matched parking results while at the same time provides an effective way for dynamically re-adjusting the parking providers' price. Through extensive simulations, we show how ParkForU performs and benefits both users and parking providers.","","978-1-5386-3227-7","10.1109/PERCOMW.2018.8480321","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8480321","","Vehicles;Urban areas;Sensors;Heuristic algorithms;Smart phones;Conferences;Crowdsourcing","","3","","19","IEEE","7 Oct 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We observe that questions are often not independent in real life applications. Instead, there are logical relations between them. Similarly, workers that provide answers are not independent of each other either. Answers given by workers with similar attributes tend to be correlated. Therefore, we propose a novel unified graphical model consisting of two layers. The top layer encodes domain knowledge which allows users to express logical relations using first-order logic rules and the bottom layer encodes a traditional crowdsourcing graphical model. Our model can be seen as a generalized probabilistic soft logic framework that encodes both logical relations and probabilistic dependencies. To solve the collective inference problem efficiently, we have devised a scalable joint inference algorithm based on the alternating direction method of multipliers.

To be specific, the Pick N Park system was proposed and implemented to gather and deliver real-time information about a number of car parks in crowded urban areas. The proposed system not only assists drivers in planning their journeys; but it also helps alleviate the traffic congestion problem especially in front of the shopping malls (where a line of cars waiting to enter the car park blocks other traffic). In addition to the system, we also propose a car park model that can be used to estimate the congestion level and the search time of each car park.

Analysis performed on 'dirty' data may lead to erroneous insights and thereby shaping decisions poorly. The aspect of big data that deals with its correctness is known as big data veracity. Trusting the data acquired goes a long way in implementing decisions from an automated decision-making system and veracity helps to validate the data acquired. In this paper, we present our solution to the big data veracity problem using crowdsourcing techniques. Our solution involves the use of sentiment analysis, which deals with identifying the sentiment expressed in a piece of text. As a proof of concept, we have developed an app that requires users to tag tweets as per the sentiment it evokes in them. Each tweet would therefore get ratified by hundreds of our participants and the sentiment associated to the tweet gets tagged. The tagged emotion was then evaluated against the verified emotion as compared to a verified data set. This analysis was then plotted on a ROC curve and also evaluated against verified data using a Bayesian predictor trained with a trinomial function. As can be seen, an accuracy of 81% was obtained as displayed by the ROC curve and 89% through the Bayesian predictor. Also, a MAP analysis of the Bayesian predictor yields neutral sentiment as the most probable hypothesis. By doing this, we have proven that crowdsourcing of sentiment analysis is a viable solution to the problem of big data veracity and therefore an aid in making better decisions.","","978-1-5090-6167-9","10.1109/ICMLA.2016.0184","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7838288","Sentiment Analysis;Big Data;Crowdsourcing;Bayesian Predictor;Machine Learning;Tweet Mining","Big data;Crowdsourcing;Bayes methods;Data models;Twitter;Sentiment analysis;Data mining","","3","","8","IEEE","2 Feb 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this work we analyze how the crowdsourcing system performance is degraded with the use of noisy annotators' reliability parameters and we derive an alternative MAP based rule to be applied when these parameters are neither known nor even estimated by the decision system.

In this paper, we work on new task allocation schemes for mobile crowdsourcing in Opportunistic Mobile Social Networks (OMSNs) which are formed opportunistically when people gather together. Our goal is to distribute the tasks to the minimum number of users using the minimum number of forwarders quickly. Our task allocation problem is related to the set cover problem which is NP-hard. To solve it, we put forward a heuristic opportunistic task allocation approximation (OTAA) algorithm where we use a consumer control criterion to reduce the number of consumers and a forwarder control criterion to select the best forwarder. After the analysis of two typical OMSN traces, we find it better to delegate all the tasks to the selected forwarder to reduce latency. Simulation results comparing our proposed algorithm with its variations using the two OMSN traces confirm that our proposed algorithm exhibits a high success rate, lowest latency, and uses small numbers of consumers and forwarders.","","978-1-5386-3652-7","10.1109/ICCNC.2018.8390273","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8390273","crowdsourcing;opportunistic mobile social networks;task allocation","Task analysis;Resource management;Crowdsourcing;Recruitment;Approximation algorithms;Social network services;Heuristic algorithms","","3","","18","IEEE","21 Jun 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Living in an environment where basic human needs are not continuously met can prevent people from achieving the work outcomes that would otherwise be possible without the poverty barrier. To overcome inequality and a lack of local jobs, technology can provide opportunities to sell services and products globally via online markets, crowdsourcing platforms, and other business models. The skills needed to participate in online markets vary from the basic to the highly specialized. Learning basic skills is a realistic possibility for many people; however, empowerment initiatives supported by governments and businesses are required to provide the necessary technology, infrastructure, and training to those living in poverty, so that they can make their services, skills, and products available to global customers. The application of such initiatives will impact participants' lives, reduce unemployment rates, and alleviate poverty, in addition to offering benefits to stakeholders and other involved parties. This paper highlights the need for investment in providing opportunities in the Gaza Strip to people whose choices have been limited by poverty, empowering them to overcome these barriers and to play innovative roles in shaping their local economies. A model is proposed for running social enterprises with a focus on the micro-tasks offered by popular crowdsourcing platforms, and utilizing market demand to train and empower motivated individuals to gain a source of income and to exploit the potential opportunities.","","978-1-6654-4078-3","10.1109/eSmarTA52612.2021.9515761","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9515761","Poverty;crowdsourcing;Gaza Strip;freelancing;community empowerment","Crowdsourcing;Training;Strips;Biological system modeling;Government;Medical services;Stakeholders","","3","","18","IEEE","23 Aug 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper reports on whether the number of speech stimuli presented to the listeners has an impact on the user perception of certain degradation conditions applied to the speech signal. To this end, a crowdsourcing study has been conducted with 209 listeners that were divided in three non-overlapping user groups, each of which was presented with tasks containing a different number of stimuli: 10, 20, or 40. Listeners were asked to rate speech stimuli with respect to their overall quality and the ratings were collected on a 5-point scale in accordance with ITU-T Rec. P.800. Workers assessed the speech stimuli of the database 501 from ITU-T Rec. P.863. Additionally, the influence of certain speech signal characteristics, such as interruptions and bandwidth, on the quality perception of the workers was investigated.","","978-1-5386-6857-3","10.1109/ISM.2018.00-16","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8603280","crowdsourcing;speech quality assessment;listener perception;speech degradation;quality of experience","Degradation;Task analysis;Crowdsourcing;Noise measurement;Correlation;Usability;Telephony","","2","","25","IEEE","6 Jan 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For such purpose, Wi-Fi radio map would be of great help to them to make proper AP selections (e.g, vertical handover) along with their movement. However, crowdsourcing-based approaches require a large number of volunteers to monitor and report signals on streets, and war driving is too coarse for accurate map construction in complicated urban building environment. In this research, we propose a Wi-Fi radio map construction mechanism using both crowdsourcing and highly-precise simulation. Once some cooperative smartphone users collect Wi-Fi beacon data with RSS information, it estimates “tx-tile” for each AP, which is “virtual” transmission source on a wall of the building where AP is inside. Then using this tx-tile with estimated tx-power, it executes online Wi-Fi radio propagation simulations with 3D city models to complement RSS information in many other areas that are not covered by the limited number of cooperative users.","","978-1-5386-9151-9","10.1109/PERCOMW.2019.8730836","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8730836","","Wireless fidelity;Urban areas;Smart phones;Buildings;Crowdsourcing;Solid modeling;Databases","","2","","7","IEEE","6 Jun 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The smartphone measurement data is analyzed for three LTE cells and compared with codeselective measurements of a field strength meter.

Apart from that, we study the multi-campaign scenario in our problem, which is not uncommon in practical applications while not yet discussed in existing works. The worker diversity of the campaigns is formulated as another score term in the objective function.

The key issue is to realize an image collection method using crowdsourcing and a method to improve the matching accuracy between images of cultural heritage buildings captured 50 to 100 years ago and current images. As degradation and damage to the appearance of cultural heritage buildings occurs due to ageing, rebuilding, and renovation, image features of the timed images are changed. This decreases the accuracy of the matching process that uses the appearance of patch-region. In addition, we need to give more consideration to incorrect feature correspondence that is prominent in buildings with considerable symmetry. We aim to solve these difficulties by applying an Autoencoder and a guided matching method. Our method involves utilizing the function of crowdsourcing, which can easily obtain the current image captured at the same position and orientation as the past image. We propose this method to address the inability to obtain the correspondence points between two images when observation times are significantly different.","","978-1-7281-0858-2","10.1109/BigData47090.2019.9006399","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9006399","Time-lapse;Cultural Heritage;Crowdsourcing;Image matching;Autoencoder","Buildings;Cultural differences;Image matching;Crowdsourcing;Feature extraction;Image resolution;Degradation","","2","","16","IEEE","24 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Campaigners solicit content generated by users by mentioning explicit criteria that the media content should satisfy, for example a `noise pollution' campaigner who wants to measure noise level of a city neighborhood, may ask potential users for audio clips recorded at a certain location at peak hours of weekdays. Subscribed users voluntarily or on paid terms generate content against those interests. Given that a user may subscribe to different campaign interests and its generated content may satisfy different interests in varying degree of accuracy, we propose methods to evaluate contents based on the degree of satisfaction against the subscribed interests, and then develop techniques for delivering those contents to the campaign end points so that it optimizes the user's resource utilization, such as energy and bandwidth.","","978-1-4799-8126-7","10.1109/NSysS.2015.7043527","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7043527","","Media;Mobile communication;Crowdsourcing;Sensors;Subscriptions;Cities and towns","","2","","19","IEEE","19 Feb 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
