"Urban Functional Zone Mapping With a Bibranch Neural Network via Fusing Remote Sensing and Social Sensing Data","R. Fan; R. Feng; W. Han; L.

UFZ mapping, which identifies the UFZ categories in different spatial areas of a city, is of considerable significance to urban management, design, and sustainable development. Various deep learning-based (DL-based) methods, which achieved remarkable results in an end-to-end supervised process, were proposed for UFZ mapping. However, the excellent performance of DL-based models relies heavily on a large number of well-annotated samples, which is impossible to obtain in practical UFZ mapping scenarios. Obtaining these well-annotated samples requires a lot of manual costs, which greatly limits the outcome of these methods in practical UFZ mapping tasks. In this article, we proposed a UFZ mapping method using OpenStreetMap-based (OSM-based) sample generation and the bi-branch neural network (BibNet). By adopting the idea of OSM-based sample generation, the proposed method utilized large-scale crowdsourcing labeled data (source domain) in OSM to generate a UFZ dataset (target domain) from OSM using remote sensing and social sensing data. Considering the inconsistent response of UFZ to various data observations, it is difficult to fully reflect the characteristics of UFZs using only remote sensing or social sensing data. We further proposed the BibNet, which utilizes two different deep neural network branches to comprehensively harness remote sensing images and social sensing data to map the UFZ. Experiments were conducted in Shenzhen City and Hong Kong City (Yau Tsim Mong District, Sham Shui Po District and Kowloon City District). The proposed method achieved an overall accuracy (OA) of 94.46% in the testing set of Shenzhen City and OA of 91.90% in the testing set of Hong Kong City.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2021.3127246","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:41925007,U1711266); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9612047","Deep learning (DL);OpenStreetMap (OSM);remote sensing;social sensing;urban functional zones (UFZ) mapping","Remote sensing;Urban areas;Sensors;Task analysis;Data models;Visualization","","12","","52","CCBY","11 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Thus, collecting pervasive crowdsourced signatures is feasible. Autonomous localization of such signatures promotes the development of a self-deployable and ubiquitous indoor positioning system (IPS). However, previous crowdsourcing-based IPSs have not considered leveraging such data for developing ubiquitous IPSs. They have relied on methods for data selection and sources for localization adjustment that could work against realizing a ubiquitous system. In contrast, this study introduces a framework Everywhere that leverages crowdsourced data to develop a ubiquitous IPS and addresses existing challenges while developing such systems. Particularly, inertial data selection criteria are proposed to autonomously generate traces with better localization. Moreover, pervasive global navigation satellite system (GNSS) data are leveraged to adjust trace localization, while simultaneously introducing a deploying location (inside elevators) of one anchor node. The node surveys all the floors while reducing the localization error, especially for the buildings surrounded by GNSS-denied areas. Additionally, cumulative data densification is leveraged to realize pervasive resources within the building, thereby boosting trace adjustment and extending database spatial coverage. Furthermore, a better selection of neighboring fingerprints is proposed to enhance online fingerprinting. Such a framework can promote a ubiquitous IPS development for buildings regardless of whether they are surrounded by open sky or GNSS-denied areas.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2022.3222003","Shenzhen Science and Technology Innovation Commission(grant numbers:JCYJ20170818104822282); Hong Kong Research Grants Council (RGC) Competitive Earmarked Research(grant numbers:PolyU 152151/17E); Smart City Research Institute of Hong Kong Polytechnic University; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9951140","Crowdsourcing;fingerprinting;indoor localization;Internet of Things (IoT);location-based service (LBS);ubiquitous localization","Location awareness;Floors;Buildings;Fingerprint recognition;Global navigation satellite system;Internet of Things;Smart phones","","11","","37","IEEE","15 Nov 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The recent boom of network-ready (mobile) devices and the subsequent mobile crowdsourcing applications do offer an opportunity to accomplish this task, yet equipping commodity devices with ambient temperature sensing capability is highly non-trivial and hence has never been achieved. In this paper, we propose Acoustic Thermometer (AcuTe+) as an interference-resilient ambient temperature sensor empowered by a single commodity smartphone. AcuTe+ utilizes on-board dual microphones to estimate air-borne sound propagation speed, thereby deriving ambient temperature. To accurately estimate sound propagation speed, we leverage the phase of chirp signals to circumvent the low sample rate on commodity hardware. In addition, we propose to use both structure-borne and air-borne propagations to address the multipath problem. Most importantly, we equip AcuTe+ with a mask-based desnoising algorithm to handle intensive acoustic interference. As a mobile, economical, highly accurate sensor, AcuTe+ may potentially enable many relevant applications, in particular large-scale indoor/outdoor temperature monitoring in real-time. We have conducted extensive experiments on AcuTe+; the results demonstrate a median error of 0.6$^\circ$∘C even under severe acoustic interference (overall median 0.3$^\circ$∘C), and they also showcase the practical ability of AcuTe+ in real-time distributed temperature sensing.","1558-0660","","10.1109/TMC.2021.3096792","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:U20A20181,61732017,61902060); National Social Science Fund of China(grant numbers:19ZDA103); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9484787","Acoustic sensing;temperature sensing;smartphone sensing;multipath problem;denoising","Estimation;Temperature sensors;Sensors;Discrete Fourier transforms;Mobile computing;White noise;Temperature measurement","","11","","59","IEEE","14 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The auction mechanism we develop addresses participatory concerns of the sensors that arise due to energy consumption associated with sensor participation while maximizing the utility of the FC to achieve desired sensing objectives and preventing market manipulations. Moreover, since a crowdsensing environment is typically resource-constrained, in our auction model, we consider that the sensors in the network quantize their private value estimates regarding their energy costs prior to communicating them to the FC.

A statistical hypothesis test is proposed to identify groups of driving directions at an entry of an intersection, which have synchronous traffic light signaling. This information is used to improve the detection of the relevant traffic light signal in case there is a different signaling for the driving directions. Based on a test data set, we classified whether the signaling is synchronous or not with an accuracy of 93.8%. To assess the usefulness of our mapping scheme, we have investigated its contribution to a camera-based traffic light recognition system.

Nevertheless, labels from amateur workers are often noisy, which inevitably degenerates the robustness of subsequent learning models. To improve the label quality for subsequent use, majority voting (MV) is widely leveraged to aggregate crowdsourced labels due to its simplicity and scalability. However, when crowdsourced labels are “heavily” noisy (e.g., 40% of noisy labels), MV may not work well because of the fact “garbage (heavily noisy labels) in, garbage (full aggregated labels) out.” This issue inspires us to think: if the ultimate target is to learn a robust model using noisy labels, why not provide partial aggregated labels and ensure that these labels are reliable enough for learning models? To solve this challenge by improving MV, we propose a coarse-to-fine label filtration model called double filter machine (DFM), which consists of a (majority) voting filter and a sparse filter serially. Specifically, the DFM refines crowdsourced labels from coarse filtering to fine filtering. In the stage of coarse filtering, the DFM aggregates crowdsourced labels by voting filter, which yields (quality-acceptable) full aggregated labels. In the stage of fine filtering, DFM further digs out a set of high-quality labels from full aggregated labels by sparse filter, since this filter can identify high-quality labels by the methodology of support selection. Based on the insight of compressed sensing, DFM recovers a ground-truth signal from heavily noisy data under a restricted isometry property. To sum up, the primary benefits of DFM are to keep the scalability by voting filter, while improve the robustness by sparse filter. We also derive theoretical guarantees for the convergence and recovery of DFM and reveal its complexity. We conduct comprehensive experiments on both the UCI simulated and the AMT crowdsourced datasets. Empirical results show that partial aggregated labels provided by DFM effectively improve the robustness of learning models.","2162-2388","","10.1109/TNNLS.2019.2899045","Australian Research Council(grant numbers:FT130100746,DP140100545,DP180100106,DP180100966,LP150100671); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8667730","Coarse-to-fine label filtration;double filter machine (DFM);heavily noisy labels;majority voting (MV);robustness;scalability;support selection","Noise measurement;Compressed sensing;Crowdsourcing;Robustness;Data aggregation;Mathematical model;Scalability","","10","","52","IEEE","15 Mar 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

An improved density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise clustering algorithm and a gradual fitting algorithm are used to remove the outliers and improve the lane data accuracy. The proposed method is quantitatively evaluated against a real-world HD map produced by a mobile mapping vehicle.

The papers were classified according to their publishing frequency, the article type, both the topics and sectors to which they belonged, their methodological approaches, and the importance for business process management capability areas as well as capability subareas. Finally, word frequency queries were used to better understand diverse social media applications in business processes and to derive practical recommendations. The necessity for a multidisciplinary approach toward business processes was detected; therefore, topics, such as psychology, business economics, or information systems, were included, emphasizing innovation strategies, including gamification, big data, or crowdsourcing. Our most important recommendation concerns the evolution of business process management through different social media tools as a means to achieve a transition toward the recommended omnichannel management approach.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2903983","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8663288","Business process management (BPM);social media;omnichannel;CRM;m-commerce;gamification;crowdsourcing","Social networking (online);Companies;Tools;Business process management;Media;Collaboration","","10","","44","OAPA","8 Mar 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Crowdsourced data collection in vehicular networks must be performed in a communication-efficient manner due to the resource-constrained wireless communication links. Moreover, it is a pressing problem to improve the quality of responses because workers may provide data of poor quality or even fabricate data to defraud rewards. While the existing work has focused on spatial/temporal task coverage and monetary rewards, in this work, we propose a cost-efficient framework for crowdsourced data collection in vehicular networks while ensuring the accuracy of the response. Crowdsourced data collection consists of two main steps: 1) task assignment and 2) crowdsourced answer gathering. We first propose a task assignment scheme that maximizes the overall data quality and reduces the amount of data transmission. We estimate the data quality level based on a Gaussian mixture model and reduce the amount of data transmission by carefully selecting a subset of vehicles for crowdsourced tasks. We then design an answer gathering scheme that considers both the length of the aggregation tree and data delivery and minimizes the communication cost for collecting answers from participants. Extensive experiments on both synthetic data sets and real data sets show that our proposed framework achieves promising results.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2021.3065716","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61902040,61972056); Scientific Research Fund of Hunan Provincial Education Department(grant numbers:20B015); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9377461","Communication cost;crowdsourcing;data quality;vehicular networks","Task analysis;Crowdsourcing;Sensors;Data integrity;Data collection;Redundancy;Servers","","9","","61","IEEE","12 Mar 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We observe that there is a pitfall preventing current practice from systematic display energy reduction. In particular, existing objective DBS schemes lack direct connection to the subjective human perception on DBS-enabled videos, which is the key to achieving human-centered energy-experience optimization. To overcome this pitfall, we present CrowdDBS, a crowdsourced display energy reduction framework for mobile video viewing. CrowdDBS is empowered by a set of crowdsourcing studies that uncover the relationship between human perception and DBS frequency, magnitude, and temporal consistency, respectively. Motivated by the insights obtained from these studies, CrowdDBS employs a suit of designs and a DBS optimization framework to optimize the energy-experience tradeoff in mobile video viewing. Comprehensive experimental results and user evaluations under a variety of practical settings show that CrowdDBS can achieve 37 percent device energy reduction on average while guaranteeing satisfactory user experience in mobile video viewing.","1558-0660","","10.1109/TMC.2018.2812852","NSF(grant numbers:ECCS-1405594,ECCS-1406154); National Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61601080,61761136019); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8307275","Brightness scaling;crowdsourcing;mobile energy;human perception;mobile video","Satellite broadcasting;Streaming media;Brightness;Crowdsourcing;Optimization;Mobile handsets;Distortion","","9","","40","IEEE","6 Mar 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Our Wasserstein Adversarial Regularization (WAR) encodes a selective regularization, which promotes smoothness of the classifier between some classes, while preserving sufficient complexity of the decision boundary between others.

In this paper, a mobile crowdsourcing (MCS) based mobile crowd computing framework for ICV networks is proposed, where multiple vehicles act as workers to provide computing services for end user (EU). In particular, artificial noise (AN) assisted physical (PHY) layer security approaches are used to enhance the security in offloading links. Ergodic secrecy rates in different offloading phases in time-varying channels are derived. In addition, an incentive-driven mechanism is introduced to encourage workers to share their idle computing resources, and an optimization problem is formulated to minimize the overall price paid for computing tasks, subject to energy consumption and delay constraints.

The emergency of the fifth-generation (5G) technologies, such as device-to-device (D2D) communications, vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications, and crowdsourcing networks is expected to help achieve highly accurate positioning. By employing nearby mobile terminals to estimate position cooperatively, these technologies can improve positioning accuracy effectively, especially in indoor and urban areas. Despite the benefit, the potential information disclosure in these positioning systems threatens the engagement of public participants (also known as reference points). The location of the reference points and their distances to a target point is quite sensitive since they can be easily used to locate the reference points once exposed. Though existing solutions based on Paillier homomorphic encryption have been proposed to preserve the privacy of distance information. The sensitivity of reference points’ locations is ignored. Additionally, the adoption of Paillier introduces a high computation cost, which is impractical in reality. To address the above problems, this article proposes two efficient protocols, named Pub-pos and Pri-pos. By leveraging matrix concatenation and multiplication, these two protocols can disguise the original sensitive data, including both distance and location information, into a random matrix while keeping a positioning result intact. We analyze the security strength, complexity, and optimal variable selection of the proposed protocols. Numerous experiments verify that our proposed protocols have significant efficiency improvement in both system and individual levels compared with a Paillier-based solution.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2022.3161148","Academy of Finland(grant numbers:308087,335262,345072,350464); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62072351); Open Research Project of Zhejiang Laboratory(grant numbers:2021PD0AB01); Shaanxi Innovation Team Project(grant numbers:2018TD-007); Higher Education Discipline Innovation Project(grant numbers:B16037); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9739352","Cloud computing;device to device (D2D) communications;D2D positioning;fifth-generation (5G);location privacy protection;vehicle to vehicle (V2V)","Privacy;Protocols;Sensitivity;Input variables;Urban areas;Vehicular ad hoc networks;Transportation","","9","","28","IEEE","22 Mar 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In microtask programming, microtasks involve changes to a single artifact, are automatically generated as necessary by the system, and nurture quality through iteration.

CPD projects have the potential to use socialized design resource for creative product development because they are openly participated by a large number of socialized designers. However, CPD projects are unreliable, unpredictable, and usually endure low success rate. We believe that the reason for these problems is that many unreliable factors caused by the nature of CPD mode are disturbing the implementation of CPD projects, but few research works can provide systematic and quantitative understanding of the relationship between these factors and CPD project feasibility, which makes it difficult for stakeholders to evaluate and manage their CPD projects. To mitigate these problems, in this paper an improved Bayesian causal map approach is developed and used to build a CPD project feasibility analysis model. The model can reveal the interaction relationship among the factors, and provide quantitative evaluation of CPD project feasibility given the states of the factors. In this way, the model can help the stakeholders in CPD project management by showing them which factors require priority processing and providing them with the prediction of project success rate, and eventually improve the overall reliability of CPD projects. The model has been verified through sensitivity analysis and post analysis on real CPD projects.","1558-0040","","10.1109/TEM.2018.2889841","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:71571142); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8620227","Bayesian causal maps;Bayesian networks;community-based product design (CPD);crowdsourcing, opensource;project feasibility analysis (PFA)","Bayes methods;Product design;Stakeholders;Crowdsourcing;Task analysis;Reliability;Sensitivity analysis","","8","","67","IEEE","20 Jan 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In previous work, the extension of IBM’s Sentiment Lexicon of Idiomatic Expressions was proposed to include around 9,000 idioms; a crowdsourcing service manually annotates both lexicons. Therefore, in this research, we provide a knowledge-based expansion approach to avoid human annotation of idioms.

While it is extensively studied that product ideas with high popularity on OICs are of great importance to the product development, research on what social behaviors of online users lead to the high popularity is largely unclear. This article conducts an empirical study by collecting a large-scale, quantitative dataset from an OIC between 2014 and 2018. With the analysis of users’ online idea posting and commenting behaviors, our results reveal that the idea contribution experience, together with comment diversity, positively influence the overall popularity of an individual's ideas, while the motivation of providing comments is negatively related.

Indeed, the IoT infrastructure paves the way toward connecting vehicles for various benefits including traffic monitoring, crowdsourcing, energy trading, and other ITS services. One of the use cases of the IoV is Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) energy charging/discharging, which is expected to be an integral part of the ITS. In V2V paradigm, Electric Vehicles (EVs) with bidirectional chargers can communicate with a grid edge network or directly with another EV using low-power wide-area networks (LPWAN) or 5G wireless connection to offer or demand energy. V2V energy exchange allows EV owners to make money from selling their battery’s excess energy to other EVs. One of the main challenges for the wide adoption of V2V is the development of mechanisms that maximize the benefits for participants. In the V2V paradigm, energy providers and suppliers require mechanisms that ensure maximal matching for the optimal social welfare of the users. In this paper, we propose a double-sided auction mechanism that matches EVs by pairing bids and asks such that the traded volume and the utilities are maximized.

However, there is some doubt regarding the generalizability of the models trained and validated on available datasets. This is due to dataset biases, which occur when the same semantic label is used in different ways across datasets, and/or when identical object categories are labeled differently across datasets. In this paper, we demonstrate the existence of dataset biases with a sample of eight remote sensing image datasets, first showing they are readily discriminable from a feature perspective, and then demonstrating that a model trained on one dataset is not always valid on others. Past approaches to reducing dataset biases have relied on crowdsourcing, however this is not always an option (e.g., due to public-accessibility restrictions of images), raising the question: How to structure annotation tasks to efficiently and accurately annotate images with a limited number of nonexpert annotators? We propose a collaborative annotation methodology, conducting image annotation experiments where users are placed in either a collaborative or individual condition, and we analyze their annotation performance. Results show the collaborators produce more thorough, precise annotations, requiring less time than the individuals. Collaborators labels show less variance around the consensus point, meaning their assigned labels are more predictable and likely to be generally accepted by other users. Therefore, collaborative image annotation is a promising annotation methodology for creating reliable datasets with a reduced number of nonexpert annotators. This in turn has implications for the creation of less biased image datasets.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2017.2697003","Munich Aerospace; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7926346","Dataset biases;remote sensing images;semantic image annotation;sensory and semantic gaps;user evaluation","Remote sensing;Semantics;Collaboration;Synthetic aperture radar;Optical sensors","","7","","29","IEEE","11 May 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this article, we propose a novel method named UnionNet, which is not only theoretically consistent but also experimentally effective and efficient. Specifically, unlike existing methods that either fit a given label from each annotator independently or fuse all the labels into a reliable one, we concatenate the one-hot encoded vectors of crowdsourced labels provided by all the annotators, which takes all the labeling information as a union and coordinates multiple annotators. In this way, we can directly train an end-to-end deep neural network by maximizing the likelihood of this union with only a parametric transition matrix.

We develop a deep learning computer vision model to score images according to their aesthetic value and we validate its output through crowdsourcing. By applying it to over 15 B Flickr photos, we study for the first time how image beauty is distributed over a large-scale social system. Beautiful images are evenly distributed in the network, although only a small core of people get social recognition for them. To study the impact of exposure to quality on user engagement, we set up matching experiments aimed at detecting causality from observational data. Exposure to beauty is double-edged: following people who produce high-quality content increases one's probability of uploading better photos; however, an excessive imbalance between the quality generated by a user and the user's neighbors leads to a decline in engagement.

Due to the scale and dynamic characteristics of these environments, service consumers may have little or no experience with the available services. To this end, reputation systems are proposed and have played a crucial role in the success of online service-oriented transactions. In this paper, we study the current reputation systems used in commercial environments. In these rating-based reputation systems, we found they are not only resilient to the changes (time lag) but also vulnerable to unfair ratings. To address the problems in parallel, we propose an adaptive reputation model (ARM). ARM can dynamically adjust its model parameters to adapt the latest changes in a service. To tackle time lag, the proposed model generalizes the fixed sliding window, used in current commercial platforms, into a dynamic sliding window mechanism. Thus, the model can completely mitigate the influence of obsolete ratings. To detect unfair ratings, our model implements a statistical strategy based on hypothesis testing after transforming the ratings in the linear window into residuals. Experiments not only validate the effectiveness of the proposed model but also show that it outperforms the existing reputation system by 45% on average based on five test cases. The results also show that the proposed model can asymptotically converge to the underlying reputation value as ratings begin to accumulate. Note to Practitioners—The reputation models adopted by current commercial platforms, such as Amazon, eBay, and Taobao, not only suffer heavily from unfair rating but also resilient to the changes in services. To address the problems simultaneously, we design and implement a hybrid model that continuously monitors received ratings and aggregates the reputation value in a self-adaptive way. Our model first fits received fair ratings using the Bayesian linear regression approach and captures the distribution of fair ratings; it then filters out unfair ratings leveraging hypothesis testing. Finally, to sensitively respond the dynamic service changes, the dynamic sliding window algorithm in our model shifts the rating collection window into a new one and discards outdated ratings, reputation value is aggregated in the new window to mitigate the influence of obsolete ratings. Extensive experiments are conducted on widely used scenarios to demonstrate the efficiency and the effectiveness of our proposed model.","1558-3783","","10.1109/TASE.2019.2902407","National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program)(grant numbers:2018YFB1004403); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61725201); Japan Society for the Promotion of Science(grant numbers:17H00759); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8672470","Adaptive reputation model (ARM);Bayesian linear regression;dynamic sliding window;time lag;unfair rating","Adaptation models;Hidden Markov models;Bayes methods;Microsoft Windows;Computational modeling;Linear regression;Windows","","6","","47","IEEE","21 Mar 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Moreover, they usually adopt planar laplacian mechanism to achieve geo-indistinguishability, which will introduce excessive noise due to its randomness and boundlessness. To this end, we propose a task alloCAtioN approach via grOup-based noisE addition under Geo-I, referred to as CANOE. Its main idea is that each worker uploads the noisy distances between his true location and the obfuscated locations of his preferred tasks instead of uploading his obfuscated location. In particular, to alleviate the total noise when conducting grouping, we put forward an optimized global grouping with adaptive local adjustment method OGAL with convergence guarantee. To collect the noisy distances which are required for subsequent task allocation, we develop a utility-aware obfuscated distance collection method UODC with solid privacy and utility guarantees.

First, we formulate this problem as a discrete time model and design a location aware online admission and selection control algorithm (LAAS) based on the Lyapunov optimization technique. The LAAS algorithm only depends on the currently available information and makes all the control decisions independently and simultaneously. Next, we utilize the recent advancement of the accurate prediction of smartphones' mobility and sensing request arrival information in the next few time slots and develop a predictive location aware admission and selection control algorithm (PLAAS). We further design a greedy predictive location aware admission and selection control algorithm (GPLAAS) to achieve the online implementation of PLAAS approximately and iteratively. Theoretical analysis shows that under any control parameter V > 0, both LAAS and PLAAS algorithm can achieve O(1/V)-optimal average profit, while the sensing request backlog is bounded by O(V).

Particularly, multiple distributed servers in a decentralized network can realize real-time collaborative statistical estimation by disseminating statistics from their separate databases. Despite no raw data sharing, the real-time statistics could still expose the data privacy of crowdsourcing participants. For mitigating the privacy concern, while the traditional differential privacy (DP) mechanism can be simply implemented to perturb the statistics in each timestamp and independently for each dimension, this may suffer a great utility loss from the real-time and multidimensional crowdsourced data. Also, the real-time broadcasting would bring significant overheads in the whole network. To tackle the issues, we propose a novel privacy preserving and communication-efficient decentralized statistical estimation algorithm (DPCrowd), which only requires intermittently sharing the DP protected parameters with one-hop neighbors by exploiting the temporal correlations in real-time crowdsourced data. Then, with further consideration of spatial correlations, we develop an enhanced algorithm, DPCrowd+, to deal with multidimensional infinite crowd-data streams.

Over the past few years, most studies focus on classifying an image into one scene category, while in real-world scenarios, it is more often that a single image contains multiple scenes. Therefore, in this article, we investigate a more practical yet underexplored task—multiscene recognition in single images. To this end, we create a large-scale dataset, called MultiScene, composed of 100 000 unconstrained high-resolution aerial images. Considering that manually labeling such images is extremely arduous, we resort to low-cost annotations from crowdsourcing platforms, e.g., OpenStreetMap (OSM). However, OSM data might suffer from incompleteness and incorrectness, which introduce noise into image labels. To address this issue, we visually inspect 14 000 images and correct their scene labels, yielding a subset of cleanly annotated images, named MultiScene-Clean. With it, we can develop and evaluate deep networks for multiscene recognition using clean data. Moreover, we provide crowdsourced annotations of all images for the purpose of studying network learning with noisy labels. We conduct experiments with extensive baseline models on both MultiScene-Clean and MultiScene to offer benchmarks for multiscene recognition in single images and learning from noisy labels for this task, respectively.

The accuracy of the recognition approaches heavily relies on the training dataset having correctly annotated labels. These labels are usually assigned using crowdsourcing or web-based queries for economic and fast annotation. However, the annotation generates abundant noisy labels in the dataset. This paper proposes a locomotion mode recognition approach capable of handling noisy labels in the training dataset. The approach builds an ensemble model by developing three different deep learning-based models, namely conventional, noise adaptive, and noise corrective, to handle different concentrations of noisy labels.

To address the needs of this diverse mode, one should first be able to identify PTWs from the rest of the vehicles. The aim of the specific study is to develop models to reveal the contributing factors which are related to the identification of PTWs using solely smartphone sensors' data and tree-based machine learning approaches. To boost the accuracy of the identification task, popular feature selection algorithms and meta-modeling strategies are implemented and evaluated.

Since conventional methods can hardly meet the demands, a novel measurement of the air temperature has been proposed by using the battery temperature sensor of the smartphone, which can provide a refined data in a crowdsourcing way. First, a heat transfer retrieval model among the air temperature, battery temperature, and the pocket of the clothing or the desk is established. Then, coefficients of the retrieval model are obtained by the data set measured through the smartphone and the thermometer in the linear fitting method. Finally, we retrieve the air temperature in a specific site with a time resolution of 1 min based on the retrieval model by three independent smartphones. The retrieval air temperature of four models strongly correlates to the true value, indicating that the retrieval model can sense the variation of the air temperature. Meanwhile, root-mean-square errors of the 1st and 4th model are 0.35 °C and 0.45 °C, implying the high retrieval accuracy. The results suggest that the retrieval model can provide a short timescale (minute) and robust estimation of the air temperature by smartphone temperature sensors.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2021.3063488","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:41975030,41505135,41475020); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9367269","Atmospheric sounding;crowdsourcing;measurements of air temperature;smartphone battery sensor","Temperature measurement;Temperature sensors;Ocean temperature;Batteries;Battery charge measurement;Atmospheric modeling;Temperature distribution","","5","","25","IEEE","3 Mar 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, there is no systematic and formal studies which examine such deficiencies. This paper presents the first attempt, which develops a novel data analytical framework to uncover online reputation system deficiencies from data. We develop two novel measures to quantify the efficiency of online reputation systems: (1) ramp up time of a new service provider, (2) long term profit gains for a service provider. We present a new data analytical framework to evaluate these two measures from data. We show that inherent preferences or personal biases in expressing feedbacks (or ratings) cause the computational infeasibility in evaluating the ramp up time and the long term profit gains from data. We develop two computationally efficient randomized algorithms with theoretical performance guarantees to address this computational challenge. We apply our methodology to analyze real-life datasets (from eBay, Google Helpouts, Amazon and TripAdvisor).

In this article, we leverage a new opportunity enabled by recent advances in RF-based inertial tracking that achieves centimeter accuracy. We present EZMAP, a high-accuracy, low-cost floor plan construction system that fuses RF and inertial sensing. EZMAP combines the fine-grained yet local information from RF tracking with the coarse grained but global contexts from inertial sensing (e.g., magnetic field strength), which together makes for an accurate map. Our system employs a robot for trajectory collection and requires only a single access point to be arbitrarily installed in the space, both of which are widely available nowadays. Furthermore, it can generate a map even only a small amount of data is available, allowing it to scale for different buildings, such as malls, office buildings, and homes with little cost. We validate the performance using a Dji RoboMaster S1 robot with commodity WiFi in three different buildings. The results show that our system can efficiently generate faithful maps for the targeted areas. With the ubiquity of the WiFi infrastructure and the rise of home robots, we believe our approach will pave the way for pervasive indoor maps services.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2022.3228740","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9983988","Indoor map construction;simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM)","Trajectory;Floors;Robot sensing systems;Buildings;Wireless fidelity;Inertial sensors;Dead reckoning","","4","","37","IEEE","13 Dec 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The review helpfulness prediction module assesses the helpfulness of reviews, i.e., whether the review is useful for developers. The topic-sentiment modeling module groups the topics of the helpful reviews and also predicts the associated sentiment, and the multifactor ranking module aims at prioritizing semantically representative reviews for each topic as the review summary.

In particular, we consider the problem of classifying m binary labels with XOR queries that ask whether the number of objects having a given attribute in the chosen subset of size d is even or odd. The subset size d, which we call query degree, can be varying over queries. We consider a general noise model where the accuracy of answers on queries changes depending both on the worker (the data provider) and query degree d. For this general model, we characterize the information-theoretic limit on the optimal number of queries to reliably recover m labels in terms of a given combination of degree-d queries and noise parameters.

Much prior empirical work uses eye movement as a proxy to understand human visual perception. Diverse apparatus and techniques have been proposed to collect eye movements, but there is still no optimal approach. In this paper, we review 30 prior works for collecting eye movements based on three axes: (1) the tracker technology used to measure eye movements; (2) the image stimulus shown to participants; and (3) the collection methodology used to gather the data. Based on this taxonomy, we employ a webcam-based eyetracking approach using task-specific visualizations as the stimulus. The low technology requirement means that virtually anyone can participate, thus enabling us to collect data at large scale using crowdsourcing: approximately 12,000 samples in total. Choosing visualization images as stimulus means that the eye movements will be specific to perceptual tasks associated with visualization. We use these data to propose a Scanner Deeply, a virtual eyetracker model that, given an image of a visualization, generates a gaze heatmap for that image. We employ a computationally efficient, yet powerful convolutional neural network for our model. We compare the results of our work with results from the DVS model and a neural network trained on the Salicon dataset.

The quality of event logs is a constraining factor in achieving reliable insights. Particular quality problems are posed by activity labels which are meant to be representative of organisational activities, but may take different manifestations (e.g. as a result of manual entry synonyms may be introduced). Ideally, such problems are remedied by domain experts, but they are time-poor and data cleaning is a time-consuming and tedious task. Ontologies provide a means to formalise domain knowledge and their use can provide a scalable solution to fixing activity label similarity problems, as they can be extended and reused over time. Existing approaches to activity label quality improvement use manually-generated ontologies or ontologies that are too general (e.g. WordNet). Limited attention has been paid to facilitating the development of purposeful ontologies in the field of process mining.

A highly precise citywide indoor positioning service is possible, if an accurate city radio map is available. However, tremendous time and effort are required to construct a city radio map through manual calibration. This paper proposes a method for constructing a city radio map through the crowdsourcing of Wi-Fi fingerprints from numerous smartphones. The proposed method classifies the buildings in a city into three categories: buildings in residential areas, commercial areas, and public areas. Then, it develops location-labeling techniques appropriate for the collected fingerprints from buildings in each category. Experiments conducted in the cities of Daejeon and Seoul revealed that the proposed method can construct a precise city radio map with minimal cost in a short period of time.

The majority of existing representation learning approaches often require a large number of consistent and noise-free labels. However, due to various reasons such as budget constraints and privacy concerns, labels are very limited in many real-world scenarios. Directly applying standard representation learning approaches on small labeled data sets will easily run into over-fitting problems and lead to sub-optimal solutions. Even worse, in some domains such as education, the limited labels are usually annotated by multiple workers with diverse expertise, which yields noises and inconsistency in such crowdsourcing settings. In this paper, we propose a novel framework which aims to learn effective representations from limited data with crowdsourced labels. Specifically, we design a grouping based deep neural network to learn embeddings from a limited number of training samples and present a Bayesian confidence estimator to capture the inconsistency among crowdsourced labels. Furthermore, to expedite the training process, we develop a hard example selection procedure to adaptively pick up training examples that are misclassified by the model. Extensive experiments conducted on three real-world data sets demonstrate the superiority of our framework on learning representations from limited data with crowdsourced labels, comparing with various state-of-the-art baselines.

However, the complexity of this activity on the scale of a city makes this a complex problem in computational terms. One of the main reasons for this is the asymmetry of information: different actors have access only to partial or outdated information, and many relevant data are simply unavailable. In this article, we propose a data integration architecture and platform with which to combine relevant data from many different sources and provide the results in a variety of forms. This integration uses semantic technologies, thus ensuring that the relationships among data show their actual meaning and are appropriately interpreted. The resulting platform amalgamates: open data, which is available from public sources; extracted data, obtained from public sites by means of scraping techniques; pre-processed data, stored in public databases; aggregated data, acquired from pervasive devices by means of crowdsourcing; smart data, supplied by mobile applications and enriched with contextual information, or data concerning specific incidents, often provided by the users themselves. The semantic integration of this information makes it possible to compute a wide range of results, from accessible transport routes to identifiable events, in a coordinated manner. The general public is then supplied with these results through the use of specific software, via either mobile applications or the web. We are of the opinion that the collective use of this information may improve urban welfare.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3033584","Access@City research project; Spanish Ministry of Science, Innovation and Universities(grant numbers:TIN2016-78103-C2-1-R); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9239273","Crowdsourcing;data acquisition;data processing;open data;pervasive computing;semantics;smart data;social computing;software architecture;urban mobility","Smart cities;Software;Data integration;Computer architecture;Crowdsourcing","","3","","85","CCBY","26 Oct 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Internet media have gradually become the main mobile crowdsourcing applications for information dissemination and user communication, including online news and social networks. However, the potential business opportunities have stimulated the emergence of a large number of spammers, who release false speech, advertisements, pornographic contents, and phishing websites on the media to gain commercial benefits, which seriously affects the experience of normal users. Therefore, in order to reduce the harm of false information, the research on the identification technology of spammers has been carried out extensively. However, the traditional technologies of identifying spammers involve high data costs and poor effects, and most of them are concentrated in the field of social networks, while less research is carried out in the field of online news. In this paper, we propose an effective technology of identifying online news comment spammers based on the label propagation algorithm (LPA), making full use of the user comment behaviors and contents. First of all, we collect a large amount of news and comments from NetEase News and label some users in the data as spammers or normal users manually to construct a labeled dataset. Then, a set of behavioral and semantic features are extracted and quantified from the user comment behaviors and comment contents by statistical analysis. Next, we propose the identification technology based on the LPA. Finally, the set of feature values is input into the proposed technology in different combinations, and experiments and evaluations are carried out to determine the most effective combination of features and improve the technology. The results show that the technology proposed in this paper involves a lower data cost but a better identification effect than some traditional technologies based on the supervised classifier.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2900474","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61472112,J1524009,61672200); Key R&D Program of Zhejiang Science and Technology Department(grant numbers:2017C03047); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8648390","Spammer identification;Internet media;online news comment;label propagation algorithm;mobile crowdsourcing applications","Media;Feature extraction;Social networking (online);Semantics;Crowdsourcing;Data mining","","3","","48","OAPA","21 Feb 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Researchers in industry and academia have proposed many adversarial example defense techniques. However, they offer partial but not full robustness. Thus, complementing them with another layer of protection is a must, especially for mission-critical applications. This article proposes a novel online selection and relabeling algorithm (OSRA) that opportunistically utilizes a limited number of crowdsourced workers to maximize the machine learning (ML) system's robustness. The OSRA strives to use crowdsourced workers effectively by selecting the most suspicious inputs and moving them to the crowdsourced workers to be validated and corrected. As a result, the impact of adversarial examples gets reduced, and accordingly, the ML system becomes more robust. We also proposed a heuristic threshold selection method that contributes to enhancing the prediction system's reliability. We empirically validated our proposed algorithm and found that it can efficiently and optimally utilize the allocated budget for crowdsourcing. It is also effectively integrated with a state-of-the-art black box defense technique, resulting in a more robust system. Simulation results show that the OSRA can outperform a random selection algorithm by 60% and achieve comparable performance to an optimal offline selection benchmark. They also show that OSRA's performance has a positive correlation with system robustness.","1558-1721","","10.1109/TR.2023.3298685","Qatar National Research Fund(grant numbers:13S-0206-200273); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10216927","Adversarial defense;adversarial examples;adversarial machine learning;crowdsourcing;evasion attacks;online relabeling;reliable deep learning systems;security","Robustness;Training;Crowdsourcing;Task analysis;Perturbation methods;Mission critical systems;History","","3","","42","IEEE","14 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Analyzing the time spent by visitors at Points of Interests (POIs) is crucial in various fields, such as urban planning, tourism, marketing, and transportation, as it provides insights into human behavior and decision-making. However, collecting a large sample of behavioral data by using traditional survey methods is expensive and complicated. To address this challenge, this study explores the use of crowdsourcing tools, specifically Google Popular Times (GPT), as an alternative source of information to predict the time spent at POIs. The research applies a robust regression model to analyze the data obtained from GPT. The popularity trends of the different POI categories are used to indicate the peak hours of the time spent in the city of Budapest. Non-spatial parameters such as the rating, the number of reviewers, and the category of the POIs are utilized. Furthermore, a Geographic Information System (GIS) is applied to extract the spatial parameters such as the security and safety levels, the availability of car parking, and public transport (PT) stations. The robust linear models are statistically significant based on the p-values, thus indicating a strong relationship between the independent variables and the time spent at POIs. The weekday and weekend models present 69.5% and 73.9% of the variance in the time spent at POIs, respectively. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that the visitors’ behavior is strongly affected by the category of the POIs variable. This study shows how GPT can be utilized to better understand, analyze, and forecast people’s behavior. The solution presented in this study can serve as an essential support of activity-based models, where the time spent is a crucial parameter for scheduling and optimizing activity chains.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3305957","National Research, Development and Innovation (NRDI) Office, Hungary, and the ERA-NET COFUND/EJP COFUND Program with co-funding from the European Union Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Program(grant numbers:2019-2.1.7-ERA-NET-2021-00019); János Bolyai Research Fellowship of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences(grant numbers:BO/00090/21/6); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10223210","Point of Interest;Google popular times;GIS;time spent;regression model","Behavioral sciences;Transportation;Data models;Internet;Safety;Resource management;Museums;Social networking (online);Geographic information systems","","3","","61","CCBYNCND","17 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Being the world's oldest underground metro system, London's underground is a typical transportation environment, where the Internet connectivity is often not available during journeys which predominantly take place underground along sub-surface and deep-level track lines. To alleviate the absence of continuous connectivity, we designed DeepOpp, a context-aware mobile system that facilitates offline access to online social media content. The DeepOpp operates efficiently due to its opportunistic approach: it executes content prefetching and caching operations when adequate urban 3G or WiFi signal is detected. The functionality of DeepOpp includes the crowdsourcing of measurements of signal characteristics (strength, bandwidth availability, and latency) which are subsequently used in predicting mobile network signal coverage and initiating data prefetching operations. During data prefetching, an optimization scheme selectively specifies the social media content to be cached based on current network conditions and device storage availability. We implemented DeepOpp as an Android application which we trialled during real trips on the London underground. Our evaluations show that the DeepOpp offers significant reduction when compared with existing approaches in terms of power usage and the volume of data downloaded. Even though we only tested DeepOpp in the London underground metro system, its feature set makes it readily applicable in similar underground metro systems (in cities like New York, Paris, and Shanghai) as well as in situations, where mobile device users suffer from significant connectivity interruptions.","1558-0016","","10.1109/TITS.2019.2911624","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61602168); Intel Collaborative Research Institute for Sustainable Connected Cities (ICRI Cities); University of California Center on Economic Competitiveness in Transportation (UCCONNECT); European Unions Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Program(grant numbers:645198); HuXiang Youth Talent Program(grant numbers:2018RS3040); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8701618","Context-aware computing;mobile crowdsourcing;opportunistic networking","Social networking (online);Prefetching;Mobile handsets;Urban areas;Internet;Context-aware services;Performance evaluation","","3","","30","IEEE","29 Apr 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The idea of manipulating the inputs of the replicated computations, which is introduced in this paper for the first time, prevents attacks made by cheater or malicious workers, even in the case of collusion among these workers. By mixing inputs, collusive cheater workers are prevented from easily detecting replication; thus, they do not return random or partial results as output. Adding noise to the inputs prevents cheater and malicious workers from detecting replication, even in the case of collusion among workers. Therefore, they do not return incorrect output. To evaluate the proposed method, we adopt a game-theoretic approach. We also provide a simulation environment to evaluate the overhead of the proposed method. We demonstrate that the proposed method can guarantee high accuracy with low overhead, even when malicious workers constitute the majority of the workers. For instance, the proposed method can ensure high accuracy with 61.27 percent overhead in the case of 60 percent malicious workers.","1939-1374","","10.1109/TSC.2017.2771469","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8101003","Service integrity assurance;MapReduce;cloud computing;volunteer computing;crowdsourcing;game theory","Computer applications;Distributed processing;Security;Grid computing;Outsourcing;Crowdsourcing","","3","","50","IEEE","9 Nov 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, most prior related work relies on a strong assumption that workers’ solution accuracy levels are public knowledge, which may not hold in many practical scenarios. We relax such an assumption and propose an online mechanism, which allows the platform to learn the distribution of the workers’ solution accuracy levels via asking workers to report their private accuracy levels (which do not need to be the true values), in addition to deciding their effort levels and solution reporting strategies. The mechanism design is challenging, as neither the workers’ task solutions nor their accuracy reports can be verified. We devise a randomized reward mechanism that computes the workers’ rewards based on their reported accuracy levels, under which the workers obtain rewards if their reported solutions match the majority. We show that our mechanism induces workers to truthfully report their solution accuracy levels in the long run, in which the empirical accuracy distribution (collected from workers’ accuracy reports) converges to the actual accuracy distribution.

We propose to design an intelligent crowdsourcing solution that incentivizes independent APs to truthfully measure/report data relating to their wireless channel utilization (CU). Our work focuses on challenging scenarios where independent APs can take advantage of recurring patterns in CU data by utilizing distribution aware strategies to obtain higher reward payments. We design truthful reporting methods that utilize logarithmic and quadratic scoring rules for reward payments to the APs. We show that when measurement computation costs are considered then under certain scenarios these scoring rules no longer ensure incentive compatibility. To address this, we present a novel reward function which incorporates a distribution aware penalty cost that charges APs for distorting reports based on recurring patterns.

Therefore, in crowdsourced software testing, checking a large number of test reports is an arduous but unavoidable software maintenance task. Crowdsourced test reports are numerous, complex, and need to be sorted to improve inspection efficiency. There are no systematic methods for prioritizing reports in crowdsourcing test report prioritization. However, in regression testing, test case prioritization technology has matured. Therefore, we migrate the test case prioritization method to crowdsourced test report prioritization and evaluate the effectiveness of these methods.

To address the device heterogeneity problem, differential fingerprinting methods have been explored, which mitigate the device characteristics that cause RSS from different commercial devices to report differently. In this article, we focus on mean differential fingerprinting (MDF) that produces the differential fingerprints by subtracting the mean RSS value of all access points from the original RSS fingerprints. We study the localization performance of the MDF method by means of the Cramér–Rao lower bound (CRLB) and show analytically that it outperforms another method that addresses device diversity. Furthermore, we evaluate the localization accuracy of existing solutions using real-life Wi-Fi RSS data sets collected by multiple consumer devices. The experimental results confirm our analytical findings and demonstrate the effectiveness of the MDF method to mitigate device diversity, as well as other factors that affect the RSS readings, including the device carrying mode and power control schemes of the Wi-Fi infrastructure, thus contributing to the wider adoption of crowdsourced IPS.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2023.3235921","Institute of Information and Communications Technology Planning and Evaluation (IITP) Grant; Korea Government (NFA, Developed of Wireless Communication Tracking-Based Location Information System in Disaster Scene for Fire-Fighters and Person Who Requested Rescue)(grant numbers:2019-0-01325); European Union’s Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme(grant numbers:739551 (KIOS CoE)); Republic of Cyprus through the Deputy Ministry of Research, Innovation and Digital Policy; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10013655","Cramér–Rao lower bound (CRLB);device heterogeneity;differential signal strength fingerprinting;indoor localization","Fingerprint recognition;Wireless fidelity;Location awareness;Performance evaluation;Internet of Things;IP networks;Crowdsourcing","","3","","40","IEEE","10 Jan 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The main challenge focuses on learning a common representation space for videos and queries where the similarity measurement can reflect the semantic closeness. However, existing video-text retrieval models may suffer from the following noise in the common space learning procedure: First, the video-text correspondences in positive pairs may not be exact matches. The crowdsourcing annotation for existing datasets leads to inevitable tagging noise for non-expert annotators. Second, the learning of video-text representation is based on the negative samples randomly sampled. Instances that are semantically similar to the query may be incorrectly categorized as negative samples. To alleviate the adverse impact of these noisy pairs, we propose a novel robust video-text retrieval method that protects the model from noisy positive and negative pairs by identifying and calibrating noisy pairs with their uncertainty score. In particular, we propose a noisy pair identifier, which divides the training dataset into noisy and clean subsets based on the estimated uncertainty of each pair. Then, with the help of uncertainties, we calibrate the two types of noisy pairs with an adaptive margin triplet loss and a weighted triplet loss function, respectively. To verify the effectiveness of our methods, we conduct extensive experiments on three widely used datasets. Experimental results show that the proposed robust video-text retrieval methods successfully identify and calibrate the noisy pairs and improve retrieval performance.","1941-0077","","10.1109/TMM.2023.3239183","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62206137,62206200,62276257,62036012,62066033); National Natural Science Foundation of Inner Mongolia(grant numbers:2022MS06025); Government of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region(grant numbers:NJYT23105); Applied Te chnology Research and Development Program of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region(grant numbers:2020GG0046,2021GG0158,2020PT0002); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10024790","Noise calibration;uncertainty;video text retrieval","Noise measurement;Semantics;Uncertainty;Task analysis;Representation learning;Visualization;Training","","3","","49","IEEE","23 Jan 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

First, formulate this problem as a discrete time model and the interaction procedure between the platform and smartphones as a Stackelberg game. Then, we introduce the Lyapunov optimization technique and design a Stackelberg game based dynamic Admission and Scheduling algorithm(SAS). In SAS, all control decisions are made only based on the currently available information and none of the stakeholders, including the platform and smartphones, can improve his utility by unilaterally changing its current strategy. Next, we design an online Cooperative dynamic Admission and Scheduling algorithm(CAS) for the situation where the platform and smartphones work in a cooperative way. Theoretical analysis shows that under any control parameter V > 0, both SAS and CAS algorithm can achieve O(1/V)-optimal average profit while the sensing request backlog is bounded by O(V). The extensive numerical results based on both synthetic and real trace demonstrate the Stackelberg equilibrium of the SAS.

Generally speaking, collecting SVP datasets involves a crowdsourcing process where annotations are obtained from a wide range of online users. Since the process is done without quality control, SVP datasets are known to suffer from noise. This leads to the issue that not all samples are trustworthy. Facing this problem, we need to develop robust models for learning SVP from noisy crowdsourced annotations. In this paper, we construct two general robust learning frameworks for this application. Specifically, in the first framework, we propose a probabilistic framework to explicitly model the sparse unreliable patterns that exist in the dataset. It is noteworthy that we then provide an alternative framework that could reformulate the sparse unreliable patterns as a “contraction” operation over the original loss function. The latter framework leverages not only efficient end-to-end training but also rigorous theoretical analyses. To apply these frameworks, we further provide two models as implementations of the frameworks, where the sparse noise parameters could be interpreted with the HodgeRank theory.

Existing works in the literature are limited either by focusing solely on minimizing order completion time or reduction of cost incurred in delivery of orders. In this paper, we develop a framework for optimal assignment of food delivery orders to workers as a multi-objective linear programming (MOLP) problem that makes a trade-off in between the worker profit and customer satisfaction. Due to NP-hardness of the above MOLP, a polynomial time solution of the food delivery problem has been developed, namely WWOFooD, exploiting Water Wave Optimization, a meta-heuristic algorithm. The WWOFooD not only explores ways of enhancing service quality of the customers, but also ensures giving additional incentives to the workers providing faster and reliable food delivery services. The results of simulation experiments depict that the WWOFooD offers competitive workers’ profit as well as significantly enhances customer satisfaction compared to the state-of-the-art works.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3187692","University of Dhaka and a Grant for the Research Fellowship; Information and Communication Technology Division, Ministry of Posts, Telecommunications and Information Technology, Government of Bangladesh; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9812619","Mobile crowdsourcing;food delivery;profit maximization;customer satisfaction;water wave optimization","Customer satisfaction;Costs;Crowdsourcing;Reliability;Delays;Task analysis;Routing","","2","","36","CCBY","1 Jul 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It has opened up meeting an extensive list of real-life applications such as measuring air pollution levels, road traffic information, etc. In literature, this is known as mobile crowdsourcing or mobile crowdsensing. In this paper, the discussed set-up consists of multiple task requesters (or task providers) and multiple IoT devices (as task executors), where each of the task providers has multiple homogeneous sensing tasks. Each task requester reports a bid and the number of homogeneous sensing tasks to the platform. On the other side, multiple IoT devices report the ask (the charge for imparting its services) and the number of sensing tasks they can execute. The valuations of task requesters and IoT devices are private information, and both might act strategically. One assumption that is made in this paper is that the bids and asks of the agents (task providers and IoT devices) follow decreasing marginal returns criteria. Given the above-discussed scenario, the objectives are: (1) to determine a set of quality IoT devices for each of the tasks held by the task requesters, and (2) to select a subset of quality IoT devices from among the available quality IoT devices for each of the sensing tasks. In this paper, a truthful mechanism is proposed for allocating the IoT devices to the sensing tasks carried by task requesters that also keep into account the quality of IoT devices. Through theoretical analysis, it is shown that the mechanism is truthful, budget balanced, individually rational, computationally efficient, correct, and prior-free. Further, probabilistic analysis is carried out to estimate the average number of tasks that get executed for any task requester. The simulations are carried out to measure the performance of the proposed mechanism against the benchmark mechanisms on the ground of truthfulness, budget balance, satisfaction level, average incentive, and computational efficiency.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3186095","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9805590","Auctions;crowdsensing;internet of Things;quality;strategic;truthfulness","Task analysis;Internet of Things;Sensors;Crowdsensing;Pollution measurement;Atmospheric measurements;Roads","","2","","85","CCBY","24 Jun 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It involves collecting a large number of annotations from several, often naive untrained annotators for each data instance which are then combined to estimate the ground truth. Further, annotations for constructs such as affect are often multi-dimensional with annotators rating multiple dimensions, such as valence and arousal, for each instance. Most annotation fusion schemes however ignore this aspect and model each dimension separately. In this article we address this by proposing a generative model for multi-dimensional annotation fusion, which models the dimensions jointly leading to more accurate ground truth estimates. The model we propose is applicable to both global and time series annotation fusion problems and treats the ground truth as a latent variable distorted by the annotators.

Besides, the quality of collected images is various. Low-quality images may degrade the performance of 3D reconstruction. To avoid low-quality images and motivate participants to provide high-quality images, we take image quality into account when allocating rewards. In this article, we propose a pricing mechanism, called ImgPricing, to determine the rewards of participants in 3D reconstruction. We model the process of image collection as a cooperative game, and regard image quality and the arrival sequence of images as critical factors in the reward allocation. ImgPricing differs from traditional pricing schemes, e.g., Shapley value and Banzhaf power index-based methods, in that it introduces the images’ arrival sequence to be an indispensable element. We lastly implement ImgPricing on the Android platform and extensively evaluate its performance. Our evaluation results demonstrate that ImgPricing outperforms other existing schemes in terms of computational efficiency, fairness, and robustness.

There are many existing methods for digital privacy protection, including network security, cryptography, and access control. However, there is still a gap in the digital privacy protection levels available for users. This paper studies the digital privacy divide (DPD) problem in ICT systems. First, we introduce an online DPD study for understanding the DPD problem by collecting responses from 776 ICT users using crowdsourcing task assignments. Second, we propose a factor analysis-based statistical method for generating the DPD index from a set of observable DPD question variables. In particular, the DPD index provides one scaled measure for the DPD gap by exploring the dimensionality of the eight questions in the DPD survey. Third, we introduce a DPD proportional odds model for analyzing the relationship between the DPD status and the socio-demographic patterns of the users. Our results show that the DPD survey meets the internal consistency reliability with rigorous statistical measures, e.g., Cronbach’s  $\alpha =0.92$ .

The concept was scarcely studied until 2013, when the series of workshops on SMs was created, and the topic began to receive more attention. However, it is not clear how research has evolved since then. This article aims to investigate and summarize how the research field of SM has evolved since 2013, to outline the state of the art and practice, and identify research opportunities within this field. We performed a systematic literature review analyzing the quantity and quality of publications, the main topics addressed, the current classifications of SMs, the context in which the concepts are used, and the main perceived challenges. We identified and analyzed 56 relevant studies addressing 12 topics, representing the current practical landscape of research regarding SM. Our findings suggest that: 1) research interest in SM is increasing, but is still concentrated into two research clusters; 2) topics are grouped under two main headings: a) human behavior and b) software development; 3) there is still a need for a common taxonomy to define and classify SM; 4) the main contexts are crowdsourcing and social networks, and the majority of studies are small-scale studies in an academic setup; and 5) more empirical rigor and evidence is needed regarding their use, benefits and challenges, despite some evidence regarding challenges related to user engagement, trust, scalability, and a better human-machine collaboration.

"Darks and Stripes: Effects of Clothing on Weight Perception","K. Martynov; K. Garimella; R.

The fashion industry has been attempting to cater to this trend by designing outfits that can enhance the appearance of slimness. Two anecdotal rules, widespread in the world of fashion, are to choose dark clothes and avoid horizontal stripes, in order to appear slim. Thus far, empirical evidence has been unable to conclusively determine the validity of these rules, and there is consequently much controversy regarding the impact of both color and patterns on the visual perception of weight. In this paper, we aim to close this gap by presenting the results from a series of large-scale crowdsourcing studies that investigate the above two claims. We gathered a dataset of around 1000 images of people from the Web together with their ground-truth weight and height as well as clothing attributes about colors and patterns. To elicit the effects of colors and patterns, we asked crowd workers to estimate the weight in each image. For the analysis, we controlled potential confounds by matching images in pairs where the two images differ with respect to color or pattern, but are similar with respect to other relevant aspects. We created image pairs in two ways: firstly, observationally, i.e., from two real images; and secondly, experimentally, by manipulating the color or pattern of clothing in a real image via photo editing. Based on our analysis, we conclude that dark clothes indeed decrease perceived weight slightly but statistically significantly, and horizontal stripes have no discernible effect compared to solid light-colored clothes. These results contribute to advancing the debate around the effect of specific clothing colors and patterns and thus provide empirical grounds for everyday fashion decisions. Moreover, our work gives an outlook on the vast opportunities of using crowd sourcing in the modern fashion industry.","2688-5255","","10.23919/JSC.2020.0006","Microsoft; Facebook; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9241513","clothing;fashion;weight perception;body size;crowdsourcing","Image color analysis;Clothing;Solids;Brightness;Industries;Social computing;Indexes","","2","","28","","28 Oct 2020","","","TUP","TUP Journals"

There are multiple efforts by cellular carriers and 5G standardization on the use of crowdsourcing to minimize drive tests (MDT) and self-organize the network while improving KPIs via a user feedback loop. Since propagation highly depends upon the environment, readily-available geographical data could be coupled with the crowdsourced user data to infer performance. In this paper, we build a framework to infer KPIs by establishing a relationship between geographical data and crowdsourced channel measurements via neural networks. In particular, for a specific user location, we leverage delay spread measurements in the region to design a cone-shaped filter for the geographical and user data extraction. Then, a location-specific received signal power prediction is obtained via the neural network trained using the extracted geographical and user data. We study the impact of the angle chosen for the cone and various features selected on location-specific KPI prediction. We then leverage the location-specific inference by repeating the prediction over a set of locations in a region to infer the path loss in a given environment. In both types of KPI inference, we compare against state-of-the-art solutions and show that significant improvement in KPI prediction accuracy is achieved using the proposed strategy. Furthermore, for network planners, we show that our framework can use only geographical information to predict KPIs with a negligible error in user locations that lack signal quality data. By employing the proposed framework to predict location-specific and regional KPIs, we achieve an accurate estimation of network coverage and a 7-fold reduction in throughput estimation error compared to a state-of-the-art solution.","1939-9359","","10.1109/TVT.2021.3067880","NSF(grant numbers:CNS- 1150215,CNS-1526269); Air Force Office of Scientific Research(grant numbers:FA9550-19-1-0375); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9384266","Crowdsourced mobile network measurement;long-Term Evolution (LTE);received signal power prediction;radio propagation model;neural network","Predictive models;Neural networks;Computational modeling;Data models;Loss measurement;Delays;Shape","","1","","49","IEEE","23 Mar 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We close this gap by introducing a tighter lower bound on the fundamental limit and proving that the belief propagation (BP) exactly matches the lower bound. The guaranteed optimality of BP is the strongest in the sense that it is information-theoretically impossible for any other algorithm to correctly label a larger fraction of the tasks.

In particular, we develop mathematical models to solicit two types of cooperation preferences, i.e., (1) group-wise preferences and (2) pair-wise preferences, and extend the classical Shapley value to capture this feature. Our second contribution is tackling the intrinsic computational challenge because even for the classical Shapley value, it is computationally expensive to evaluate. We design computationally efficient randomized algorithms with theoretical guarantees to fully cover the computational space of our generalized Shapley value.

However, the content caching and sharing among mobile clients is not yet considered in Content-Centric Mobile Networking (CCMN). In this paper, to supply a stable high quality of service for content distribution, we design a novel crowdsourced CCMN framework firstly. The vicinal mobile users collaborate with each other by crowdsourcing their caching resources and radio links. Subsequently, we analyze the performance bound of crowdsourced CCMN in perspective of cached data. Furthermore, to guarantee the stability of service quality against user mobility, we propose a robust caching control scheme. We use Kullback-Leibler divergence to characterize user mobility distribution uncertainty and formulate the caching control problem into a chance-constrained robust optimization. By the evaluation results, we can see that the robust caching control mechanism can provide not only a more stable but also higher cache hit ratio than other strategies.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2875060","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61602462,61601449,61502075); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8486986","Information-centric networks;content-centric networking;mobile crowdsourcing;in-network caching","Streaming media;Wireless fidelity;Base stations;Crowdsourcing;Radio link;Uncertainty;Computer architecture","","1","","40","OAPA","9 Oct 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In order to address this problem, we present the WheelShare system, which uses machine learning to identify surfaces and curbs from vibration captured by accelerometer and gyroscope sensors (both smartphone and wearable device). WheelShare allows users to share their collected data via crowdsourcing. Based on this surface-specific vibration, we recognize 32 different surfaces found across the built environment (in Austria, China, France, Germany, India, and the USA for 32 human subjects) with an accuracy of 97.5%. The recognized surfaces are then grouped into different categories based on their characteristics. Our novel contributions in this article include the following. 1) We have developed a machine-learning-enabled surface recognition system that uses sensor data to capture surface-induced vibration patterns. 2) We have tested the robustness of the system for devices with only accelerometer data (such as low-end smartphones) and achieved an accuracy of 91.6%. 3) We have deployed our prototype WheelShare system for real-time surface classification in new sites that are unseen in training and testing and successfully recognized the surface characteristics.","2691-4581","","10.1109/TAI.2022.3190828","National Institute on Disability, Independent Living, and Rehabilitation Research(grant numbers:90IFDV0024); Administration for Community Living; Department of Health and Human Services; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9829917","Accessibility;classification;machine learning;smart cities;wheelchair","Wheelchairs;Vibrations;Accelerometers;Sensors;Machine learning;Gyroscopes;Wearable sensors","","1","","43","IEEE","14 Jul 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Therefore, we propose an approach to Sensing Urban text Data from Internet Resources (SUDIR). We put forward innovative work on two key issues: urban data recognition for Chinese context and urban data sensing for multi-source web resources. On one hand, we design a Chinese urban data recognition model based on Whole Word Masking for Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT-WWM) embedding model and Bidirectional Long-Short Term Memory with a Conditional Random Field (BLSTM-CRF) sequence labeling model. We introduce Chinese Word Segmentaion (CWS) concept in BERT embedding model to make the text embedding effect better represent semantic information on Chinese context. BLSTM-CRF model based on deep learning is used to achieve high-quality coding and prediction. On the other hand, we propose a method of Extracting Urban text data based on Web page features and Clustering operation (EUWC). EUWC is used to correct the false negative samples labeled by BERT-WWM+BLSTM-CRF recognition model and enable SUDIR to sense more accurate and comprehensive city data from multi-source web resources.

Particularly, in an unexplored and potentially dangerous environment, an autonomous source search algorithm that employs robotic searchers is usually applied to address the problem. Such environments could be completely unknown and highly complex. Therefore, novel search algorithms have been designed, combining heuristic methods and intelligent optimization, to tackle search problems in large and complex search spaces. However, these intelligent search algorithms were not designed to address completeness and optimality, and therefore commonly suffer from the problems such as local optimums or endless loops. Recent studies have used crowd-powered systems to address the complex problems that cannot be solved by machines on their own. While leveraging human intelligence in an AI system has been shown to be effective in making the system more reliable, whether using the power of the crowd can improve autonomous source search algorithms remains unanswered. To this end, we propose a crowd-powered source search approach enabling human-AI collaboration, which uses human intelligence as external supports to improve existing search algorithms and meanwhile reduces human efforts using AI predictions. Furthermore, we designed a crowd-powered prototype system and carried out an experiment with both experts and non-experts, to complete 200 source search scenarios (704 crowdsourcing tasks). Quantitative and qualitative analysis showed that the sourcing search algorithm enhanced by crowd could achieve both high effectiveness and efficiency.

Using only high agreement annotations introduces another challenge: the data imbalance problem. We study this challenge within the problem of relating user comments to the content of a news article. We show that traditional techniques for learning from imbalanced data, such as oversampling, using weighted loss functions, or assigning weak labels using crowdsourcing, may not be sufficient for modeling complex temporal relationships between news articles and user comments. In this study, we propose a framework for aligning comments and articles 1) from imbalanced news data characterized with 2) different degrees of annotator agreement, under 3) a constrained budget for human labeling and computing resources. Within the framework, we propose a Semi-Automatic Labeling solution based on Human-AI collaboration. We compare our proposed technique with traditional data imbalance handling techniques and synthetic data generation on the article-comment alignment problem, where the goal is to determine a category of an article-comment pair that represents how relevant the comment is to the article. Finding an effective and efficient solution is essential because it is time-consuming and prohibitively costly to manually label a sufficiently large amount of article-comment pairs based on the semantic understanding of an article and its comments. We discover that the Human-AI collaboration outperforms all alternative techniques by 17% of article-comment alignment accuracy. When there is no time or budget for re-labeling some article-comment pairs, we found that synonym augmentation is a reasonable alternative. We also provide a detailed analysis of the effect of humans in the loop and the use of unlabeled data.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3247948","U.S. NSF(grant numbers:2026513,1838145); U.S. Army Research Laboratory subaward(grant numbers:555080-78055,W911NF2220001); U.S. Army Corp of Engineers Engineer Research and Development Center under Cooperative(grant numbers:W9132V-22-2-0001); Temple University office of the Vice President for Research 2022 Catalytic Collaborative Research Initiative Program AI & ML Focus Area.

Most traffic-prediction approaches assume that a constant number of sensors are deployed on the roads, whether they are either stationary loop detectors or vehicles equipped with Global Positioning System (GPS) tracking devices. The static nature of those fixtures limits their ability to adapt to scenarios that are more dynamic. Rather than relying on several fixed sensors to detect changes and infer traffic, we use crowdsourcing to judiciously select individuals and then make predictions. Our solution consists of three core components: dynamic seed selection, regional cluster building and ensemble traffic prediction. In the first phase, we employ Efficient Transition Probability (ETP) to evaluate candidate seed sets. Road clusters are then formed using hierarchical clustering that is tweaked by a dynamic programming technique. This method assesses the eccentricity of every cluster to bond every road within each cluster more closely. Subsequently, we develop an ensemble-learning strategy in conjunction with Lasso regression to forecast traffic. The strength of our ensemble approach is its ability to manage absent seeds, a condition that has never been investigated, to our knowledge. Substantial experimental evaluation indicates that our claim of dynamic updates is valid and effective. Our solution outperforms the state-of-the-art techniques by a wide margin, in terms of prediction accuracy.","1558-0016","","10.1109/TITS.2022.3160869","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2020AAA0107100); National Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62072365); Science Foundation of Distinguished Young Scholars of Shaanxi(grant numbers:2022JC-48); Key Research and Development Program of Shaanxi(grant numbers:2022GY-332); Big Mobility Rhino-bird Special Research Program of Tencent(grant numbers:T160-CSIG-2022061300001); Innovation Capability Support Plan of Shaanxi(grant numbers:2021PT-010,2022PT-33); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9843850","Intelligent transportation systems;smart transportation;computational and artificial intelligence;machine learning;clustering algorithms;prediction methods","Vehicle dynamics;Roads;Tensors;Sensors;Predictive models;Soft sensors;Global Positioning System","","1","","56","IEEE","27 Jul 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In these cases, to improve the efficiency of task allocation, a reasonable distribution of utilities is critical. To the best of our knowledge, few studies have examined the complex task allocation and utility distribution of self-interested agents, and good solutions are lacking. To address this issue, the following works are done in this paper: first, based on a task allocation model for self-interested agents and by studying the Nash bargaining solution and the bargaining characteristics of the agents, an efficiency utility distribution algorithm satisfying individual rationality and budget effectiveness is proposed. Second, based on the best response strategy of the self-interested agent, a complex task allocation algorithm for multiple self-interested agents is proposed. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is verified by comparing the system revenues with other utility distribution and task allocation algorithms.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3099771","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61976101,62006091); University Natural Science Research Project of Anhui Province(grant numbers:KJ2020A0033); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9495778","Nash bargaining solution;self-interested agent;task allocation;utility distribution","Task analysis;Resource management;Games;Crowdsourcing;Recruitment;Particle swarm optimization","","","","41","CCBYNCND","26 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
"Crowd modelling: aggregating non-expert views as a method for theorizing","O. G. Aguilar","Felizmente Verde, Tepic, Mexico",International Journal of Crowd Science,"11 Jul 2022","2021","5","3","239","256","Purpose – This paper aims to introduce a crowd-based method for theorizing. The purpose is not to achieve a scientific theory. On the contrary, the purpose is to achieve a model that may challenge current scientific theories or lead research in new phenomena. Design/methodology/approach – This paper describes a case study of theorizing by using a crowd-based method. The first section of the paper introduces what do the authors know about crowdsourcing, crowd science and the aggregation of non-expert views. The second section details the case study. The third section analyses the aggregation. Finally, the fourth section elaborates the conclusions, limitations and future research. Findings – This document answers to what extent the crowd-based method produces similar results to theories tested and published by experts. Research limitations/implications - From a theoretical perspective, this study provides evidence to support the research agenda associated with crowd science. The main limitation of this study is that the crowded research models and the expert research models are compared in terms of the graph. Nevertheless, some academics may argue that theory building is about an academic heritage. Practical implications - This paper exemplifies how to obtain an expert-level research model by aggregating the views of non-experts. Social implications - This study is particularly important for institutions with limited access to costly databases, labs and researchers. Originality/value – Previous research suggested that a collective of individuals may help to conduct all the stages of a research endeavour. Nevertheless, a formal method for theorizing based on the aggregation of non-expert views does not exist. This paper provides the method and evidence of its practical implications.","2398-7294","","10.1108/IJCS-04-2021-0015","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9826704","Crowdsourced research;Crowdsourcing;Crowd science;Theory building;Theorizing;Citizen science","Crowdsourcing;Databases;Buildings;Lead","","","","48","","11 Jul 2022","","","TUP","TUP Journals"

To date, such activities still require considerable manual effort from experts. In this paper, we focus on a specific data preparation activity, namely data quality discovery. We explore different settings in which data workers undertake data quality discovery tasks and the implications of those settings for the efficiency and effectiveness of data workers. To this end, we propose DataOps-4G, a data quality discovery platform for generalists that allows users to interact with data without the need to write code. We wrap up pre-defined code snippets that implement useful functionalities to explore data quality and bundle the code into so-called DataOps. Then, we conduct a lab-based user study to evaluate our DataOps-4G platform from two perspectives: (i) effectiveness, the accuracy of the outcomes achieved by participants; and (ii) efficiency, their effort and strategies in task completion. Our experimental results uncover how effectiveness and efficiency can be affected by their task completion patterns and strategies. This opens up the possibility of popularizing data quality discovery processes by employing non-experts (e.g., from crowdsourcing platforms) and consequently allowing experts to focus on more complex activities (e.g., building machine learning models).","1558-2191","","10.1109/TKDE.2022.3151605","ARC(grant numbers:DP190102141); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9714027","Data quality;generalist;dataops;log analysis.","Data integrity;Task analysis;Programming;Codes;Cleaning;Data models;Annotations","","","","39","IEEE","14 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
