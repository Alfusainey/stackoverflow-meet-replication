By aggregating data from multiple vehicles, crowdsourcing can be leveraged to detect environmental information with improved accuracy. We focus on using such data to detect and localize potholes on multi-lane roads. Extracting information from aggregated vehicle data is challenging due to undersampling sensors, sensor mobility, asynchronous sensor operation, sensor noise, vehicle and road heterogeneity, and GPS position error. GPS position error is particularly problematic in multi-lane environments since the position error is generally larger than standard lane widths. In this paper, we investigate these issues and develop a crowdsourced system to detect and localize potholes in multi-lane environments using accelerometer data from embedded vehicle sensors. Our crowdsourced system reduces the required network bandwidth by determining road incline and bank angle information in each vehicle to filter acceleration components that do not correspond to pothole conditions. We evaluate our system on simulated and real-world data, analyze tradeoffs in the number of vehicles and the amount of bandwidth required for accurate detection, and compare the results to the simpler single lane detection scenario.","1558-0660","","10.1109/TMC.2017.2690995","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7892000","Transportation;classifier design and evaluation;mobile environments;singular value decomposition;machine learning","Machine learning;Intelligent vehicles;Global Positioning System;Crowdsourcing;Feature extraction;Accelerometers;Bandwidth","","70","","41","IEEE","4 Apr 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Although some innovative solutions have been proposed in the past two decades, how to accurately and efficiently localize users in indoor environments is still a challenging problem. Traditional indoor positioning systems based on Wi-Fi fingerprints or dead reckoning suffer from the variation of Wi-Fi signals and the drift of dead reckoning problems, respectively. Crowdsourcing and ambient sensing stimulate new ways to improve existing localization systems' accuracy. Using human social factors to calibrate the accuracy of localization is practical and awarding. In this paper, we propose WAIPO, a collaborative indoor localization system with the fusion of Wi-Fi and magnetic fingerprints, image-matching, and people co-occurrence. Specifically, we could obtain the most likely top-n locations based on Wi-Fi fingerprints. We utilize the statistics of users' historical locations known by image-matching, for which we propose a photo-room matching algorithm, to reduce estimating areas. In order to further improve the accuracy of localization, we propose a co-occurrence and non-co-occurrence detection algorithm to detect users' spatial-temporal co-occurrence and determine users' locations with magnetic calibration. We have fully implemented WAIPO on the Android platform and perform testbed experiments. The experimental results demonstrate that WAIPO achieves an accuracy of 87.3% on average, which outperforms the state-of-the-art indoor localization systems.","1558-2566","","10.1109/TNET.2017.2680448","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61572060); 973 Program(grant numbers:2013CB035503); CERNET Innovation Project(grant numbers:NGII20151004,NGII20160316); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7888564","Indoor localization;Wi-Fi fingerprint;co-occurrence;photo-room matching;magnetic calibration","Wireless fidelity;Magnetometers;Magnetic resonance imaging;Smart phones;Sensors;Crowdsourcing;Databases","","65","","54","IEEE","28 Mar 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Weakly-supervised learning can train models by relying on weaker forms of annotation, such as scribbles. Here, we learn to segment using scribble annotations in an adversarial game. With unpaired segmentation masks, we train a multi-scale GAN to generate realistic segmentation masks at multiple resolutions, while we use scribbles to learn their correct position in the image. Central to the model’s success is a novel attention gating mechanism, which we condition with adversarial signals to act as a shape prior, resulting in better object localization at multiple scales. Subject to adversarial conditioning, the segmentor learns attention maps that are semantic, suppress the noisy activations outside the objects, and reduce the vanishing gradient problem in the deeper layers of the segmentor. We evaluated our model on several medical (ACDC, LVSC, CHAOS) and non-medical (PPSS) datasets, and we report performance levels matching those achieved by models trained with fully annotated segmentation masks. We also demonstrate extensions in a variety of settings: semi-supervised learning; combining multiple scribble sources (a crowdsourcing scenario) and multi-task learning (combining scribble and mask supervision).

It is important to design agnostic solutions to utilize these noisy labels for supervised learning. We first investigate how imbalanced multiple noisy labeling affects the class distributions of training sets and the performance of classification. Then, an agnostic algorithm Positive LAbel frequency Threshold (PLAT) is proposed to deal with the imbalanced labeling issue. Simulations on eight UCI data sets with different underlying class distributions show that PLAT not only effectively deals with the imbalanced multiple noisy labeling problems that off-the-shelf agnostic methods cannot cope with, but also performs nearly the same as majority voting under the circumstances without imbalance.

In recent years, with the ubiquity of GPS-enabled devices and the widespread use of crowdsourcing alternatives for the collection of traffic data, transportation professionals increasingly look to such user-generated data for a good deal of analysis, planning, and decision support applications. However, due to the mechanics of the data collection process, crowdsourced traffic data such as probe-vehicle data is highly prone to missing observations, making accurate imputation crucial for the success of any application that makes use of that type of data. In this paper, we propose the use of multi-output Gaussian processes (GPs) to model the complex spatial and temporal patterns in crowdsourced traffic data. While the Bayesian nonparametric formalism of GPs allows us to model observation uncertainty, the multi-output extension based on convolution processes effectively enables us to capture complex spatial dependencies between nearby road segments. Using six months of crowdsourced traffic speed data or “probe vehicle data” for several locations in Copenhagen, the proposed approach is empirically shown to significantly outperform popular state-of-the-art imputation methods.","1558-0016","","10.1109/TITS.2018.2817879","FP7 People: Marie-Curie Actions(grant numbers:609405); European Union’s Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Program under Marie Sklodowska-Curie Individual Fellowship H2020-MSCA-IF-2016(grant numbers:745673); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8352762","Traffic data;imputation;missing data;Gaussian processes;multiple outputs;Bayesian inference;crowdsourced data","Gaussian processes;Data models;Uncertainty;Probes;Bayes methods;Roads;Predictive models","","57","","46","IEEE","30 Apr 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Meanwhile, being limited by the spare sense nodes, the air quality information is very coarse in resolution, which brings urgent demands for high-resolution air quality data acquisition. In this paper, we refer the real-time and fine-gained air quality data in city-scale by employing the crowdsource automobiles as well as their built-in sensors, which significantly improves the sensing system's feasibility and practicability. The main idea of this paper is motivated by that the air component concentration within a vehicle is very similar to that of its nearby environment when the vehicle's windows are open, given the fact that the air will exchange between the inside and outside of the vehicle though the opening window. Therefore, this paper first develops an intelligent algorithm to detect vehicular air exchange state, then extracts the concentration of pollutant in the condition that the concentration trend is convergent after opening the windows, finally, the sensed convergent value is denoted as the equivalent air quality level of the surrounding environment. Based on our Internet of Things cloud platform, real-time air quality data streams from all over the city are collected and analyzed in our data center, and then a fine-gained city level air quality map can be exhibited elaborately. In order to demonstrate the effective- ness of the proposed method, experiments crowdsourcing 500 floating vehicles are conducted in Beijing city for three months to ubiquitously sample the air quality data.

However, the advent and extensive use of MSNs has also created fertile soil for the breeding and rapid spread of rumors. Therefore, blocking the spread of rumors in MSNs has always been a hot topic in this field. With the idea of crowdsourcing, we propose a novel rumor control framework, called Crowdblocking, in which users can implement control schemes in a collaborative and distributed way, so that the rumors can be controlled more effectively. With the proposed framework, the main problem that arises is how to motivate more users to actively participate in rumor blocking activities. To this end, we design two effective incentive mechanisms in this paper. First, we propose an incentive mechanism based on the Stackelberg game for homogeneous control tasks. We theoretically analyze the Stackelberg equilibrium to maximize the utility of the network manager and users involved in blocking rumor tasks, and ensure that no user can improve its own utility by unilaterally changing the current strategy. Second, for heterogeneous control tasks, we design a real-time reverse auction incentive mechanism, which allows users to have more autonomy and freely customize their own plans to participate in control tasks. Also, we prove that the mechanism possesses the desired properties of task timeliness, computational efficiency, user rationality, manager profitability, and price truthfulness. Finally, we validate the efficiency of the proposed mechanisms through extensive simulation experiments on the real datasets.","1939-9359","","10.1109/TVT.2019.2930667","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61872228,61877037,61702317,61601273,61602289); National Science Foundation(grant numbers:1704287); Fundamental Research Funds; Central Universities of China(grant numbers:2017TS046,GK201803081); Scholarship of China Scholarship Council(grant numbers:201806870045); Natural Science Basic Research Plan in Shaanxi Province of China(grant numbers:2019JM-379); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8771125","Mobile social networks;rumor blocking;incentive;auction;Stackelberg game","Task analysis;Social networking (online);Optimal control;Real-time systems;Games;Computational modeling;Vehicle dynamics","","54","","44","IEEE","24 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Availability of a quick turn-around time diagnostic test would essentially mean that life, in general, can return to normality-at-large. In this regards, studies concurrent in time with ours have investigated different respiratory sounds, including cough, to recognise potential Covid-19 carriers. However, these studies lack clinical control and rely on Internet users confirming their test results in a web questionnaire (crowdsourcing) thus rendering their analysis inadequate. We seek to evaluate the detection performance of a primary screening tool of Covid-19 solely based on the cough sound from 8,380 clinically validated samples with laboratory molecular-test (2,339 Covid-19 positive and 6,041 Covid-19 negative) under quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) from certified laboratories. All collected samples were clinically labelled, i.e., Covid-19 positive or negative, according to the results in addition to the disease severity based on the qRT-PCR threshold cycle (Ct) and lymphocytes count from the patients. Our proposed generic method is an algorithm based on Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) for cough sound detection with subsequent classification based on a tensor of audio sonographs and deep artificial neural network classifier with convolutional layers called ‘DeepCough’. Two different versions of DeepCough based on the number of tensor dimensions, i.e., DeepCough2D and DeepCough3D, have been investigated. These methods have been deployed in a multi-platform prototype web-app ‘CoughDetect’. Covid-19 recognition results rates achieved a promising AUC (Area Under Curve) of $98.80\% \pm 0.83\%$98.80%±0.83%, sensitivity of $96.43\% \pm 1.85\%$96.43%±1.85%, and specificity of $96.20\% \pm 1.74\%$96.20%±1.74% and average AUC of $81.08\% \pm 5.05\%$81.08%±5.05% for the recognition of three severity levels.

We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework on LIVE video database. Both of the two random designs are promising sampling methods without jeopardizing the accuracy of the results. In particular, due to balanced sampling, random regular graphs may achieve better performances when sampling rates are small. However, when the number of videos is large or when sampling rates are large, their performances are so close that Erdös-Rényi random graphs, as the simplest independent and identically distributed sampling scheme, could provide good approximations to random regular graphs, as a dependent sampling scheme.

A new graph construction scheme which is proved to be the optimal choice to model the smoothness assumption in semi-supervised learning is proposed to explore the informativeness conveyed by location fingerprints during the process of radio map construction. In addition, the concept of execution characteristic function is considered to minimize the RSS sample capacity at each reference point to reduce fingerprints calibration effort further.

When constructing an indoor localization map from crowd-sourced samples, the following challenges should be addressed: inaccurate sample annotation, unequal sample dimensionality, measurement device diversity, and nonuniform spatial distribution. In this paper, we propose the radio map construction from crowd-sourced sample (RMapCS) scheme to handle these challenges. The RMapCS consists of four main modules: outlier detection, source selection, fingerprint interpolation, and device calibration. For each device in each grid, we first propose an improved clustering algorithm to remove outliers and use a threshold-based approach to select only those important signal sources. For a grid without enough samples, we propose a fingerprint interpolation algorithm to construct its device-specific fingerprints. Then, we propose a device calibration algorithm to fuse samples from different devices to obtain grid fingerprints. We also propose a two-step online positioning algorithm consisting of both set comparison and similarity computation. We conduct field measurements and experiments to examine the localization performance. Results show that the proposed RMapCS can achieve significant improvements over the peer schemes and the average localization error can achieve around 1.5 m by using only the received signal strength-based fingerprints.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2830415","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61771209); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8350030","Indoor localization map construction;sample crowdsoucing;outlier detection and removal;source selection;fingerprint interpolation;device calibration","Interpolation;Anomaly detection;Calibration;Crowdsourcing;Trajectory;Indoor radio communication;Graphical models","","50","","36","OAPA","26 Apr 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Crowdsourced spectrum sensing (CSS) refers to recruiting ubiquitous mobile users to perform real-time spectrum sensing at specified locations and has great potential in mitigating the drawbacks of current spectrum database operations. Without strong incentives and location privacy protection in place, however, mobile users will be reluctant to act as mobile crowdsourcing workers for spectrum-sensing tasks. In this paper, we first formulate participant selection in CSS systems as a reverse auction problem, in which each participant's true cost for spectrum sensing is closely tied to his current location. Then, we demonstrate how the location privacy of CSS participants can be easily breached under the framework. Finally, we present PriCSS, a novel framework for a CSS service provider to select CSS participants in a differentially privacy-preserving manner. In this framework, we propose PriCSS- and PriCSS+, two different schemes under distinct design objectives and assumptions. PriCSS- is an approximately truthful scheme that achieves differential location privacy and an approximate minimum payment, while PriCSS+ is a truthful scheme that achieves differential location privacy and an approximate minimum social cost.

However, the existing GPM methods do not consider the multiple end-to-end constraints of the social contexts, like social relationships, social trust, and social positions on edges in GQ, which are commonly found in various applications, such as crowdsourcing travel, social network based ecommerce, and study group selection, etc. In this paper, we first conceptually extend Bounded Simulation to Multi-Constrained Simulation (MCS), and propose a novel NP-Complete Multi-Constrained Graph Pattern Matching (MC-GPM) problem. Then, to address the efficiency issue in large-scale MC-GPM, we propose a new concept called Strong Social Component (SSC), consisting of participants with strong social connections. We also propose an approach to identifying SSCs, and propose a novel index method and a graph compression method for SSC. Moreover, we devise a multithreading heuristic algorithm, called M-HAMC, to bidirectionally search the MC-GPM results in parallel without decompressing graphs. An extensive empirical study over five real-world large-scale social graphs has demonstrated the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach.","1558-2191","","10.1109/TKDE.2017.2785824","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61532018,61402312,61572336); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8233149","Graph pattern matching;social graph","Pattern matching;Indexes;Data models;Social network services;Context modeling;Time complexity;Computational modeling","","49","","47","IEEE","21 Dec 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Understanding the determinants of species distributions and their dynamics is an important aspect of ecology and is critical for conservation and management. Through crowdsourcing, since 2002, the eBird project has been collecting bird observation records. These observations, together with local-scale environmental covariates such as climate, habitat, and vegetation phenology have been a valuable resource for a global community of educators, land managers, ornithologists, and conservation biologists. By associating environmental inputs with observed patterns of bird occurrence, predictive models have been developed that provide a statistical framework to harness available data for predicting species distributions and making inferences about species-habitat associations. Understanding these models, however, is challenging because they require scientists to quantify and compare multiscale spatialtemporal patterns. A large series of coordinated or sequential plots must be generated, individually programmed, and manually composed for analysis. This hampers the exploration and is a barrier to making the cross-species comparisons that are essential for coordinating conservation and extracting important ecological information. To address these limitations, as part of a collaboration among computer scientists, statisticians, biologists and ornithologists, we have developed BirdVis, an interactive visualization system that supports the analysis of spatio-temporal bird distribution models. BirdVis leverages visualization techniques and uses them in a novel way to better assist users in the exploration of interdependencies among model parameters. Furthermore, the system allows for comparative visualization through coordinated views, providing an intuitive interface to identify relevant correlations and patterns. We justify our design decisions and present case studies that show how BirdVis has helped scientists obtain new evidence for existing hypotheses, as well as formulate new hypotheses in their domain.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2011.176","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6065004","Ornithology;species distribution models;multiscale analysis;spatial data;temporal data.","Tag clouds;Biological system modeling;Data visualization;Predictive models;Ornithology;Spatial databases","Animals;Artificial Intelligence;Birds;Computer Graphics;Computer Simulation;Databases, Factual;Ecosystem;Flight, Animal;Models, Biological;Population Dynamics;Software;Songbirds;Species Specificity;User-Computer Interface","48","","46","IEEE","3 Nov 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A requirement is accurate positioning of people in indoor multistory environments. To achieve this, maps of the environment play a very important role. FootSLAM is an algorithm based on the simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) principle that relies on human odometry, i.e., measurements of a pedestrian's steps, to build probabilistic maps of human motion for such environments and can be applied using crowdsourcing. In this paper, we extend FootSLAM to multistory buildings following a Bayesian derivation. Our approach employs a particle filter and partitions the map space into a grid of adjacent hexagonal prisms with eight faces. We model the vertical component of the odometry errors using an autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model and extend the geographic tree-based data structure that efficiently stores the probabilistic map, allowing real-time processing. We present the multistory FootSLAM maps that were created from three data sets collected in different buildings (one large office building and two university buildings). Hereby, the user was only carrying a single foot-mounted inertial measurement unit (IMU). We believe the resulting maps to be strong evidence of the robustness of FootSLAM. This paper raises the future possibility of crowdsourced indoor mapping and accurate navigation using other forms of human odometry, e.g., obtained with the low-cost and nonintrusive sensors of a handheld smartphone.","1558-0016","","10.1109/TITS.2014.2303115","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6746646","Indoor pedestrian navigation;inertial navigation;multistory localization and mapping;simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM);Indoor pedestrian navigation;inertial navigation;multistory localization and mapping;simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM)","Simultaneous localization and mapping;Buildings;Vectors;Probabilistic logic;Navigation;Data structures","","47","","47","IEEE","21 Feb 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Unfortunately, the quality of crowdsourced labels cannot satisfy the standards of practical applications. Ground-truth inference, simply called label integration, designs proper aggregation methods to infer the unknown true label of each instance (sample) from the multiple noisy label set provided by ordinary crowd labelers (workers). However, nearly all existing label integration methods focus solely on the multiple noisy label set per individual instance while totally ignoring the intercorrelation among multiple noisy label sets of different instances. To solve this problem, a multiple noisy label distribution propagation (MNLDP) method is proposed in this article. MNLDP at first estimates the multiple noisy label distribution of each instance from its multiple noisy label set and then propagates its multiple noisy label distribution to its nearest neighbors. Consequently, each instance absorbs a fraction of the multiple noisy label distributions from its nearest neighbors and yet simultaneously maintains a fraction of its own original multiple noisy label distribution. Empirical studies on a collection of an artificial dataset, six simulated UCI datasets, and three real-world crowdsourced datasets show that MNLDP outperforms all other existing state-of-the-art label integration methods in terms of the integration accuracy and classification accuracy.","2162-2388","","10.1109/TNNLS.2021.3082496","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:U1711267); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:CUGGC03); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9444560","Crowdsourcing;distribution propagation;label integration;multiple noisy label distribution","Noise measurement;Labeling;Crowdsourcing;Reliability;Task analysis;Bayes methods;Mathematical model","Humans;Neural Networks, Computer","45","","48","IEEE","31 May 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The collected eye-tracking data certainly shed light on the detailed cognitive processes of the participants; SimulSort helped with decision-making tasks by promoting efficient browsing behavior and compensatory decision-making strategies. However, more interestingly, we also found unexpected eye-tracking patterns with Simul- Sort. We investigated the cause of the unexpected patterns through a crowdsourcing-based study (i.e., Experiment 2), which elicited an important limitation of the eye tracking method: incapability of capturing peripheral vision. This particular result would be a caveat for other visualization researchers who plan to use an eye tracker in their studies.

The goal of the player (i.e., the decision maker) here is to maximize the cumulative reward in the face of uncertainty. However, the basic MAB model neglects several important factors of the system in many real-world applications, where multiple arms (i.e., actions) can be simultaneously played and an arm could sometimes be “sleeping” (i.e., unavailable). Besides reward maximization, ensuring fairness is also a key design concern in practice. To that end, we propose a new Combinatorial Sleeping MAB model with Fairness constraints, called CSMAB-F, aiming to address the aforementioned crucial modeling issues. The objective is now to maximize the reward while satisfying the fairness requirement of a minimum selection fraction for each individual arm. To tackle this new problem, we extend an online learning algorithm, called Upper Confidence Bound (UCB), to deal with a critical tradeoff between exploitation and exploration and employ the virtual queue technique to properly handle the fairness constraints. By carefully integrating these two techniques, we develop a new algorithm, called Learning with Fairness Guarantee (LFG), for the CSMAB-F problem. Further, we rigorously prove that not only LFG is feasibility-optimal, but it also has a time-average regret upper bounded by N/2η + (β1√(mNTlogT)+ β2 N)/T, where N is the total number of arms, m is the maximum number of arms that can be simultaneously played, T is the time horizon, β1 and β2 are constants, and η is a design parameter that we can tune. Finally, we perform extensive simulations to corroborate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. Interestingly, the simulation results reveal an important tradeoff between the regret and the speed of convergence to a point satisfying the fairness constraints.","2327-4697","","10.1109/TNSE.2019.2954310","National Science Foundation(grant numbers:CNS-1651947,CCF-1657162,ECCS-1818791,CCF-1758736,CNS-1758757,CNS-1446582); ONR(grant numbers:N00014-17-1-2417); Air Force Research Laboratory(grant numbers:FA8750-18-1-0107); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8906175","Multi-armed bandit (MAB);combinatorial sleeping bandits;fairness;Upper Confidence Bound (UCB);virtual queue;Lyapunov drift;regret analysis.","Stochastic processes;Resource management;Wireless communication;Optimization;Face;Simulation;Convergence","","44","","34","IEEE","19 Nov 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A high proportion of positive reviews will bring substantial sales growth, while negative reviews will cause sales loss. Driven by the immense financial profits, many spammers try to promote their products or demote their competitors' products by posting fake and biased online reviews. By registering a number of accounts or releasing tasks in crowdsourcing platforms, many individual spammers could be organized as spammer groups to manipulate the product reviews together and can be more damaging. Existing works on spammer group detection extract spammer group candidates from review data and identify the real spammer groups using unsupervised spamicity ranking methods. Actually, according to the previous research, labeling a small number of spammer groups is easier than one assumes, however, few methods try to make good use of these important labeled data. In this paper, we propose a partially supervised learning model (PSGD) to detect spammer groups. By labeling some spammer groups as positive instances, PSGD applies positive unlabeled learning (PU-Learning) to study a classifier as spammer group detector from positive instances (labeled spammer groups) and unlabeled instances (unlabeled groups). Specifically, we extract reliable negative set in terms of the positive instances and the distinctive features. By combining the positive instances, extracted negative instances and unlabeled instances, we convert the PU-Learning problem into the well-known semisupervised learning problem, and then use a Naive Bayesian model and an EM algorithm to train a classifier for spammer group detection.

Among the various indoor positioning techniques, WLAN-based location fingerprinting has attracted considerable attention because of the wide availability of WLAN and relatively high resolution of the fingerprint-based positioning techniques. This paper introduces methods and tools to construct a GIPS by using WLAN fingerprinting. An unsupervised learning-based method is adopted to construct radio maps using fingerprints collected via crowdsourcing, and a probabilistic indoor positioning algorithm is developed for the radio maps constructed with the crowdsourced fingerprints. Along with these techniques, collecting indoor and radio maps of buildings in villages and cities is essential for a GIPS. This paper aims to collect indoor and radio maps from volunteers who are interested in deploying indoor positioning systems for their buildings. The methods and tools for the volunteers are also described in the process of developing an indoor positioning system within the larger GIPS.

In order to cope with this problem, HTTP adaptive streaming (HAS) has been proposed in recent years as a video delivery solution for the future Internet and being adopted by an increasing number of streaming services, such as Netflix and Youtube. HAS enables service providers to improve users' quality of experience (QoE) and network resource utilization by adapting the quality of the video stream to the current network conditions. However, the resulting time-varying video quality caused by adaptation introduces a new type of impairment and thus novel QoE research challenges. Despite various recent attempts to investigate these challenges, many fundamental questions regarding HAS perceptual performance are still open. In this paper, the QoE impact of different technical adaptation parameters, including chunk length, switching amplitude, switching frequency, and temporal recency, are investigated. In addition, the influence of content on perceptual quality of these parameters is analyzed. To this end, a large number of adaptation scenarios have been subjectively evaluated in four laboratory experiments and one crowdsourcing study. A statistical analysis of the combined data set reveals results that partly contradict widely held assumptions and provide novel insights in perceptual quality of adapted video sequences, e.g., interaction effects between quality switching direction (up/down) and switching strategy (smooth/abrupt). The large variety of experimental configurations across different studies ensures the consistency and external validity of the presented results that can be utilized for enhancing the perceptual performance of adaptive streaming services.","1558-0008","","10.1109/JSAC.2016.2577361","Universidad Politécnica de Madrid within the Ministerio de Economía y Competitividad of the Spanish Government (Enhanced 3DTV) and (MR-UHDTV)(grant numbers:TEC2010-20412,TEC2013-48453); Acreo Swedish ICT AB through the EIT Digital VINNOVA (Sweden’s Innovation Agency); Telecommunications Research Center Vienna (FTW) through the Austrian Government; City of Vienna within the Competence Center Program COMET; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7485884","HTTP adaptive streaming;QoE;perceptual quality;laboratory study;subjective study;crowdsourcing;cross-experimental study","Switches;Streaming media;Bandwidth;Bit rate;Internet;Quality assessment;Video recording","","40","","38","IEEE","6 Jun 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Due to the lack of priori information about the quality of workers and the ground truth, selecting the most suitable workers, which can guarantee the quality of the sensing tasks, remains a great challenge. In this paper, we propose a novel framework which can choose the most reliable workers among available workers under constraint budget. We model the quality of workers through two factors, bias and variance, which describe the continuous feature of sensing tasks. Our framework first allocate some calibration tasks to calibrate the bias and then iteratively estimate the workers variance more and more accurately. To choose more reliable workers, we face the exploration and exploitation dilemma. Therefore, we design a novel Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) algorithm which based on Upper Confidence Bounds (UCB) scheme and combined with a weighted data aggregation scheme to estimate a more accurate ground truth of a sensing task. Futhermore, a dynamic budget allocation algorithm is designed to achieve global optimization. Then, we prove the expected sensing error can be bounded according to the regret bound of the MAB. In simulation experiments, we compare our algorithm with several baselines with real-world data set and it shows the effectiveness in inferring the ground truth with limited budget.","1558-2191","","10.1109/TKDE.2020.2992531","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2019YFB2102200); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61872238,61972254); CCF-Huawei Database System Innovation Research Plan(grant numbers:CCF-Huawei DBIR2019002A); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9086123","Crowdsensing;worker selection;multi-armed bandit;data aggregation","Task analysis;Sensors;Crowdsensing;Resource management;Estimation;Data models","","39","","37","IEEE","4 May 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Furthermore, MCP collects pictures in a distributed way in which a large number of contributors upload pictures whenever and wherever it is suitable. This inevitably leads to evolving picture streams. This paper investigates the multiconstraint-driven data selection problem in MCP picture aggregation and proposes a pyramid-tree (PTree) model which can efficiently select an optimal subset from the evolving picture streams based on varied coverage needs of MCP tasks. By utilizing the PTree model in a generic MCP data collection framework, which is called CrowdPic, we test and evaluate the effectiveness, efficiency, and flexibility of the proposed framework through crowdsourcing-based and simulation-based experiments. Both the theoretical analysis and simulation results indicate that the PTree-based framework can effectively select a subset with high utility coverage and low redundancy ratio from the streaming data.

The network of connected vehicles enables users to disseminate critical information about events happening on the road (for example, accidents, traffic congestions, and hazards). The exchange of information between vehicles and RSUs could improve the driving experience and road safety, as well as help drivers to identify the hazardous and safe routes in a timely manner. The sharing of critical information between vehicles is advantageous to the driver; however, at the same time, malicious actors could mislead drivers by spreading fraudulent and fake messages. Fraudulent messages can have a negative impact on the infrastructure, and more significantly, have potential to cause threats to life. It is, therefore, essential that vehicles can evaluate the credibility of those who send messages (vehicles or RSUs) before taking any action. In this paper, we present TrustVote, a collaborative crowdsourcing-based vehicle reputation system that enables vehicles to evaluate the credibility of other vehicles in a connected vehicular network. The TrustVote system allows participating vehicles to hide their rating/feedback scores and the list of interacted vehicles under a homomorphic cryptographic layer, which can only be unfolded as an aggregate. The proposed approach also considers the trust weight of a vehicle providing the rating scores while computing the aggregate reputation of the vehicles.

Radio propagation factors, which consist of path loss and shadowing, can accurately be obtained via crowdsourcing with Kriging. In most works on Kriging-aided radio environment mapping, measurement datasets are first regressed via linear path loss modeling to ensure spatial stationarity of the shadowing. However, in practical situations, the path loss often contains an anisotropy owing to terrain and obstacle effects. Thus, Kriging may not perform an optimal interpolation because of the errors in path loss modeling. In this paper, an FFNN is used for path loss modeling. Then, ordinary Kriging is applied to interpolate the shadowing. We first evaluate the performance of this method in a case where the transmitter is fixed. It is shown that this method does not improve Kriging in a large-scale and fixed transmitter system; although the FFNN outperforms OLS in path loss modeling. Then, this method is extended to distributed wireless networks where transmitters are arbitrarily located, such as in mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) and vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs). The results of a measurement-based experiment show that the FFNN is capable of improving Kriging in such a distributed network case.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2928832","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science(grant numbers:16KK0124,16H02344,18H01439,19K14988); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8763960","Radio propagation;spatial statistics;crowdsourcing;neural network;Kriging;regression analysis","Radio transmitters;Shadow mapping;Artificial neural networks;Propagation losses;Ad hoc networks;Loss measurement;Interpolation","","37","","29","CCBY","15 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The experimental results using real apps and crowdsourcing indicate that: 1) AutoPPG creates correct and easy-to-understand descriptions for privacy policies; 2) the privacy policies constructed by AutoPPG usually reveal more operations related to users' personal information than existing privacy policies; and 3) most developers, who reply us, would like to use AutoPPG to facilitate them.","1556-6021","","10.1109/TIFS.2016.2639339","Hong Kong GRF(grant numbers:PolyU 5389/13E); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61202396,61602258); HKPolyU Research(grant numbers:G-UA3X,G-YBJX); Shenzhen City Science and Technology R&D Fund(grant numbers:JCYJ20150630115257892); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(grant numbers:2015M582663); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7782398","Mobile applications;natural language processing;privacy policy;static code analysis","Privacy;Text analysis;Androids;Humanoid robots;Libraries;Smart phones;Google","","36","","63","IEEE","13 Dec 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This paper evaluates the use of wearable sensors as an enabling technology to motivate healthier lifestyle behaviors during pregnancy. Wearable sensors have been used to track health and lifestyle in general populations. Pregnancy is associated with hormonal, physiological and psychological adaptations that need to be taken into account when quantifying lifestyle, and there is to date no solution available to accurately measure lifestyle behaviors during pregnancy. The main challenges lay in developing algorithms and systems capable of dealing with physiological adaptations, lifestyle adaptations, and enabling longitudinal monitoring throughout pregnancy. Addressing these challenges will open new opportunities towards an integrated and personalized approach to behavior change interventions based on sensor data.

However, the labor-intensive and repetitive task of the radio map construction through offline RSSI fingerprint collection prevents such services from becoming standard equipment for future smart facilities. In this paper, we present a location-aware infrastructure that combines a broad sensing layer, edge computing, and centralized cloud federation support. Our setting gives rise to a sensing mechanism that enables in-facility crowdsourcing able to aid fingerprinting localization services. To that end, instead of extensive offline measurements, we use the facility occupants to gather unlabeled RSSI samples. To support the localization functionality, we develop a probabilistic cell-based model that is constructed by an unsupervised learning algorithm. Our black-box approach maintains the positioning accuracy regardless of changes in the underlying hardware or indoor environment. To evaluate our approach, we have deployed a multistorey facility testbed and performed an extensive real-subject trial to gather the unlabeled fingerprint dataset. The proposed unsupervised method yields average location classification accuracy of 0.8 that can rise up to 0.9 when a semi-supervised approach is considered.

Our proposed method focuses on the fact that the shadowing values show strong correlation over a wide range of frequency domains. The main idea is to treat the shadowing values obtained over various frequencies as the ones over target frequency. Using the actual datasets obtained over 870, 2115, and 3500 MHz in a cellular system, we show that the proposed method can accurately generate a radio map, even if no (or few) datasets are available in the target frequency.","1939-9359","","10.1109/TVT.2021.3049894","Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications of Japan(grant numbers:JPJ000254); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9316892","Correlation;crowdsourcing;interpolation;radio map;radio propagation;spatial statistics","Location awareness;Interpolation;Time-frequency analysis;Correlation;Indoor environment;Internet of Things;Shadow mapping","","31","","55","CCBY","8 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Existing CAN bus anomaly detection mechanisms either can only detect one or two of these attacks, or require numerous CAN messages during predictions, which can hardly realize real-time performance. In this paper, we propose a CAN bus anomaly detection system that can detect all these attacks simultaneously in as short as 3 milliseconds (ms) based on Graph Neural Network (GNN). This work generates directed attributed graphs based on CAN message streams in given message intervals. Node attributes denote data contents in CAN messages while each edge attribute represents the frequency of a typical CAN ID pair in the given interval. Afterwards, a GNN is trained based on generated CAN message graphs. Considering highly imbalanced training data, a two-stage classifier cascade is developed in this paper, which is composed of a one-class classifier for anomaly detection and a multi-class classifier for attack classification. An openmax layer is further introduced to the multi-class classifier to tackle new anomalies from unknown classes. To take advantage of crowdsourcing while protecting user data privacy, we adopt federated learning to train a universal model that covers different driving scenarios and vehicle states.

A subjective visual property is useful either on its own (e.g. image and video interestingness) or as an intermediate representation for visual recognition (e.g. a relative attribute). Due to its ambiguous nature, annotating the value of a subjective visual property for learning a prediction model is challenging. To make the annotation more reliable, recent studies employ crowdsourcing tools to collect pairwise comparison labels. However, using crowdsourced data also introduces outliers. Existing methods rely on majority voting to prune the annotation outliers/errors. They thus require a large amount of pairwise labels to be collected. More importantly as a local outlier detection method, majority voting is ineffective in identifying outliers that can cause global ranking inconsistencies. In this paper, we propose a more principled way to identify annotation outliers by formulating the subjective visual property prediction task as a unified robust learning to rank problem, tackling both the outlier detection and learning to rank jointly. This differs from existing methods in that (1) the proposed method integrates local pairwise comparison labels together to minimise a cost that corresponds to global inconsistency of ranking order, and (2) the outlier detection and learning to rank problems are solved jointly. This not only leads to better detection of annotation outliers but also enables learning with extremely sparse annotations.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2015.2456887","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61402019); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(grant numbers:2014M550015); National Basic Research Program of China(grant numbers:2012CB825501,2015CB856000); NSFC(grant numbers:61071157,11421110001); NSFC-Royal Society(grant numbers:1130360,IE110976); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7159107","Subjective visual properties;outlier detection;robust ranking;Subjective visual properties;outlier detection;robust ranking;robust learning to rank;regularisation path","Visualization;Robustness;Predictive models;Ranking (statistics);Crowdsourcing;Training data;Noise measurement","","30","","63","IEEE","15 Jul 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

As such, development of automatic latent fingerprint recognition systems to quickly and accurately identify the suspects is one of the most pressing problems facing fingerprint researchers. One of the first steps in manual latent processing is for a fingerprint examiner to perform a triage by assigning one of the following three values to a query latent: Value for Individualization (VID), Value for Exclusion Only (VEO), or No Value (NV). However, latent value determination by examiners is known to be subjective, resulting in large intra-examiner and inter-examiner variations. Furthermore, in spite of the guidelines available, the underlying bases that examiners implicitly use for value determination are unknown. In this paper, we propose a crowdsourcing based framework for understanding the underlying bases of value assignment by fingerprint examiners, and use it to learn a predictor for quantitative latent value assignment. Experimental results are reported using four latent fingerprint databases, two from forensic casework (NIST SD27 and MSP) and two collected in laboratory settings (WVU and IIITD), and a state-of-the-art latent automated fingerprint identification system (AFIS). The main conclusions of this paper are as follows: 1) crowdsourced latent value is more robust than prevailing value determination (VID, VEO, and NV) and latent fingerprint image quality for predicting AFIS performance; 2) two bases can explain expert value assignments, which can be interpreted in terms of latent features; and 3) our value predictor can rank a collection of latents from most informative to least informative.","1556-6021","","10.1109/TIFS.2017.2721099","NIST Forensic Research Program; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7961274","Latent value determination;latent matching;latent examiners;crowdsourcing;matrix completion;multidimensional scaling","NIST;Fingerprint recognition;Crowdsourcing;Databases;Feature extraction;Forensics;Reliability","","29","","46","IEEE","28 Jun 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We design a Bayesian asynchronous task selection (BATS) algorithm to help the users plan their task selections based on the incomplete information of the task popularity statistics. We prove its convergence and characterize the computation time for the users’ updates. As a performance benchmark, we consider the ideal case that the service provider centrally allocates the tasks to the users for social surplus maximization. We show that it is an NP-hard problem and propose a greedy centralized algorithm with a lower complexity as the benchmark performance. Simulation results suggest that the BATS scheme achieves the highest Jain's fairness index and coverage, while yielding a user payoff similar to that with the greedy centralized benchmark.

However, existing methods for answer aggregation are designed for discrete tasks, where answers are given as a single label per item. In this paper, we consider-partial-agreement-tasks that are common in many applications such as image tagging and document annotation, where items are assigned sets of labels. Common approaches for the aggregation of partial-agreement answers either (i) reduce the problem to several instances of an aggregation problem for discrete tasks or (ii) consider each label independently. Going beyond the state-of-the-art, we propose a novel Bayesian nonparametric model to aggregate the partial-agreement answers in a generic way. This model enables us to compute the consensus of partially-sound and partially-complete worker answers, while taking into account mutual relationships in labels and different answer sets. We also show how this model is instantiated for incremental learning, incorporating new answers from crowd workers as they arrive.

To date, there are several privacy-enhancing techniques, such as secure multiparty computation techniques, private information retrieval (PIR), and data sanitization techniques. However, there is not a single technique that works for all possible uses of the data in edge systems. In addition, these techniques are computationally expensive and thus may not be suitable for edge devices. In this paper, we first cover basic privacy building blocks, including differential privacy and homomorphic encryption. We then discuss privacy solutions specific to three different types of data use that are relevant for edge-based applications: data aggregation techniques, point-of-interest (POI) services and traffic information services, and crowdsourcing.

Over the years, researchers and scientists have spent significant amounts of money and effort to answer this question. Nonetheless, despite some outstanding achievements, replacing humans in the intellectual tasks is not yet a reality. Instead, to compensate for the weakness of machines in some (mostly cognitive) tasks, the idea of putting human in the loop has been introduced and widely accepted. In this paper, the notion of collective hybrid intelligence as a new computing framework and comprehensive. Design/methodology/approach – According to the extensive acceptance and efficiency of crowdsourcing, hybrid intelligence and distributed computing concepts, the authors have come up with the (complementary) idea of collective hybrid intelligence. In this regard, besides providing a brief review of the efforts made in the related contexts, conceptual foundations and building blocks of the proposed framework are delineated. Moreover, some discussion on architectural and realization issues are presented. Findings – The paper describes the conceptual architecture, workflow and schematic representation of a new hybrid computing concept. Moreover, by introducing three sample scenarios, its benefits, requirements, practical roadmap and architectural notes are explained. Originality/value – The major contribution of this work is introducing the conceptual foundations to combine and integrate collective intelligence of humans and machines to achieve higher efficiency and (computing) performance. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this the first study in which such a blessing integration is considered. Therefore, it is believed that the proposed computing concept could inspire researchers toward realizing such unprecedented possibilities in practical and theoretical contexts.","2398-7294","","10.1108/IJCS-03-2019-0012","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9826654","Crowdsourcing;Human computation;Autonomous control;Collective machine intelligence;Human–machine collaboration;Hybrid intelligence","Crowdsourcing;Architecture;Human intelligence;Computational modeling;Computer architecture;Collective intelligence;Human in the loop","","23","","112","","11 Jul 2022","","","TUP","TUP Journals"

By attaching affordable Beacon tags to them, objects of care could be tracked and localized by user devices in the proximity. While crowd GPS service has gained popularity recently, it has not extended beyond passive mode in which localization is achieved in the background without intruding the mobility of users. In this paper, we study the localization of lost objects through the crowd GPS service in an active manner. We propose clustering users in a Beacon tag network based on the benefits they can receive from each other in terms of the localization of their lost items. A new metric is developed to quantify this benefit and the users that can provide most of the total possible benefits to each other are then grouped together so that they can provide active localization service for only the users most beneficial to them. The clustering of users is achieved based on both a greedy heuristic based algorithm and a genetic algorithm. Extensive simulation results are conducted utilizing both synthetic data and real location based social network datasets. The results show the effective partitioning of the users under different user counts and groups while valuing the privacy of users at its maximum by limiting the number of interactions between users.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2830300","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8347087","BLE tags;crowd GPS;location tracking;lost item tracking;clustering","Global Positioning System;Crowdsourcing;Privacy;Task analysis;Measurement;Mobile handsets;Sensors","","23","","39","OAPA","25 Apr 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A huge share of this traffic is caused by multimedia streaming. The quality of experience (QoE) of such streaming services is an important aspect and in most cases the goal is to maximize the bit rate which-in some cases-conflicts with the requirements of both consumers and providers. For example, in mobile environments users may prefer a lower bit rate to come along with their data plan. Likewise, providers aim at minimizing bandwidth usage in order to reduce costs by transmitting less data to users while maintaining a high QoE. Today's adaptive video streaming services try to serve users with the highest bit rates that consequently results in high QoE. In practice, however, some of these high bit rate representations may not differ significantly in terms of perceived video quality compared to lower bit rate representations. In this paper, we present a novel approach to determine the statistically indifferent quality variation of adjacent video representations for adaptive video streaming services by adopting standard objective quality metrics and existing QoE models. In particular, whenever the quality variation between adjacent representations is imperceptible from a statistical point of view, the representation with higher bit rate can be substituted with a lower bit rate representation. As expected, this approach results in savings with respect to bandwidth consumption while still providing a high QoE for users. The approach is evaluated subjectively with a crowdsourcing study. Additionally, we highlight the benefits of our approach, by providing a case study that extrapolates possible savings for providers.","1941-0077","","10.1109/TMM.2016.2629761","Austrian Science Fund(grant numbers:I1402); Austrian Research Promotion Agency; Advanced Ultra High Definition Dymamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7745907","Adaptive video streaming;MPEG–DASH;quality of experience","Streaming media;Bit rate;Quality assessment;Video recording;Multimedia communication;Optimization","","23","","31","IEEE","16 Nov 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The crowdsourcing social signals consist of timely, extensive, comprehensive, and rich intelligence that concern urban dynamics, social behaviors, and traffic environments. Such social signals provide a new paradigm for operating ITS with unstructured semantic data, making knowledge automation for decision intelligence a possibility. This article reviews the knowledge automation paradigms for cyber-physical-social systems (CPSSs) compared with traditional information automation paradigms for cyber-physical systems (CPSs) in ITS, from the perspective of data-driven, modeling space, analytical methodologies, and decision support services. To investigate the key methodology in social spaces that enhance information automation into knowledge automation, we summarize the current research into a multisource heterogeneous social signal-based traffic decision knowledge automation framework and further exploit the computational paradigm and applications scenarios of this framework.

Experimenters can easily access a huge pool of human subjects through crowdsourcing platforms. Without any supervision, low-quality workers, however, can threaten the reliability of the assessments. One of the approaches in classifying the quality of workers is to analyze their behavior during the experiments, such as mouse cursor trajectory. However, existing works analyze the trajectory coarsely, which cannot fully extract the imbedded information. In this paper, we propose a novel method to detect low-quality workers in QoE crowdtesting by analyzing the worker behavior. Our approach is to construct a predictive model by using supervised learning algorithms. A quality score is computed by applying existing anti-cheating techniques and human inspections to label the workers. We define a set of ten worker behavior metrics, which quantifies different types of worker behavior, including finer-grained cursor trajectory analysis. A multiclass Naïve Bayes classifier is applied to train a model to predict the quality of workers from the metrics. We have conducted video QoE assessments on Amazon Mechanical Turk and CrowdFlower to collect the worker behavior. Our results show that the error rates of the model trained from four metrics are equal or less than 30%. We further find that combining the predictions from the four different 5-point Likert scale rating methods can improve the success rate in detecting low-quality workers to around 80%. Finally, our method is 16.5% and 42.9% better in precision and recall than CrowdMOS.","1941-0077","","10.1109/TMM.2016.2619901","Hong Kong Polytechnic University(grant numbers:G-YBAK); Joint Universities Computer Centre of Hong Kong(grant numbers:H-ZL17); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7604053","Crowdsourcing;cheater detection;QoE Crowdtesting;QoE;worker behavior","Measurement;Reliability;Mice;Predictive models;Trajectory;Streaming media;Crowdsourcing","","23","","51","IEEE","20 Oct 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The main observation inspiring our work without reliance on such pre-deployment is that when there are sufficient participants (e.g., a crowd of panicking people), the WiFi signatures collected by participants can serve as the fingerprints (referred to as location fingerprints) of their unknown locations. By computing relative positions of these location fingerprints we can connect them to form a global map. Such a map reflects the topology of the underlying walkable space and thus holds the potential of offering a navigation path for any intended users. Based on this observation, we design Fly-Navi, a crowdsourcing based indoor navigation system via on-the-fly map generation, and primarily designed for indoor environments with rectilinear and narrow corridors. Specifically, each participant uploads sensory data, and the server then generates a global map (on-the-fly map) through a series of operations such as local map generation, local map stitch and edge computation. On top of the global map, Fly-Navi computes a navigation path to the given destination and tracks the progress. We implement the prototype of Fly-Navi and our experiments show that Fly-Navi can quickly generate a correct global map with the 80-percentile of between-fingerprint distance error less than 3 meters, which is important for computing turning points of the map and hereon offering turn-by-turn instructions, and correctly navigate the intended users to their destinations.","1558-0660","","10.1109/TMC.2020.2990446","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61672213,61732017,71671060); Excellent Young and Middle-aged Scientific and Technological Innovation Team for Universities in Hubei Province(grant numbers:T201714); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; Science and Technology Plan Projects of Wuhan City(grant numbers:2017050304010325); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9078872","Indoor navigation;on-the-fly map;MDS;crowdsourcing","Indoor navigation;Legged locomotion;Wireless fidelity;Turning;Mobile computing;Servers","","22","","49","IEEE","27 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Compared to professional video producers and broadcasters, these new generation broadcasters are highly heterogeneous in terms of the network/system configurations and, therefore, the generated video quality, which calls for massive encoding and transcoding in order to unify the video sources and serve multiple quality versions to viewers with different configurations. On the other hand, with the rapid evolution in the hardware industry, high-performance processors become mainstream in personal computer market. More end devices can easily transcode high-quality videos in realtime. We witness huge computational resource among the massive fellow viewers that could potentially be used for transcoding.

We identify that the key challenges in CrowdTranscoding are to detect qualified stable viewers and to properly assign them to the source channels. We put forward a viewer crowdsourcing transcode scheduler to smartly schedule the workload assignment.

This recommends that we reimagine Computational Social Science as Social Computing, not merely using computational tools to make sense of the contemporary explosion of social data, but also recognizing societies as emergent computers of more or less collective intelligence, innovation and flourishing. It further proposes we imagine a socially inspired computer science that takes these insights into account as we build machines not merely to substitute for human cognition, but radically complement it. This leads to a vision of social computing as an extreme form of human computer interaction, whereby machines and persons recursively combine to augment one another in generating collective intelligence, enhanced knowledge, and other social goods unattainable without each other. Using the example of science and technology, I illustrate how progress in each of these areas unleash advances in the others and the beneficial relationship between the technology and science of social computing, which reveals limits of sociality and computation, and stimulates our imagination about how they can reach past those limits together.","2688-5255","","10.23919/JSC.2020.0002","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9241509","social computing;complex systems;computer supported cooperative work;computational social science;artificial intelligence;human computer interaction;human-centered computing","Social computing;Cognition;Collaboration;Social networking (online);Artificial intelligence;Encyclopedias","","22","","103","","28 Oct 2020","","","TUP","TUP Journals"

In database-driven DSS, a geo-location database administrator (DBA) maintains spectrum availability information over its service region in the form of a Radio Environment Map (REM), where the received signal strength from the primary user at every location is either directly measured via spectrum sensing or estimated via statistical spatial interpolation. Crowdsourcing-based spectrum sensing is a promising approach for periodically collecting spectrum measurements over a large geographic area but is unfortunately vulnerable to false spectrum measurements. Despite a large body of prior work on secure cooperative spectrum sensing, how to construct an accurate REM in the presence of false measurements remains an open challenge. In this paper, we introduce ST-REM, a novel spatiotemporal approach for securely constructing an REM in the presence of false spectrum measurements. Inspired by the self-label techniques developed for semi-supervised learning, ST-REM iteratively constructs an REM from a small number of spectrum measurements from trusted anchor sensors and many more measurements from mobile users. During each iteration, the DBA evaluates the trustworthiness of each measurement by jointly considering its spatial fitness with other trusted measurements and the mobile user's long-term behavior. By gradually incorporating the most trustworthy spectrum measurements, the DBA is able to construct a REM with high accuracy.

Our unified framework efficiently integrates ranging and fingerprinting for striking an appealing accuracy versus deployment cost tradeoff, where the crowdsourcing required for the construction of fingerprinting databases can also be addressed with little human intervention. By intrinsically amalgamating the global grid sampling and the regularized importance-resampling techniques, a nonparametric belief propagation algorithm is proposed for achieving the accurate position estimation at the cost of a moderate computational complexity. For improving the robustness to environmental variations, a likelihood-ratio-based approach is employed to detect ranging outliers. Moreover, a low-complexity serial scheduling scheme defined over factor graphs is designed for real-time localization. We design a hybrid ultrawide bandwidth and Wi-Fi localization system relying on off-the-shelf commercial devices and evaluate the proposed unified framework in a typical office building.

With recent developments in federated learning (FL), crowdsourcing has emerged as a promising cost-effective data source for training powerful TMI classifiers without compromising users’ data privacy. However, existing TMI approaches have relied heavily on the availability of transportation mode labels, which is often limited in real-world applications. While recent semisupervised studies have partially addressed this issue by assigning pseudolabels to unlabeled data, such practice often degrades classification performance as more unlabeled data are incorporated. In response to this issue, we present a semisupervised FL scheme for TMI termed mean teacher semisupervised FL (MTSSFL). MTSSFL trains a deep neural network ensemble under a novel semisupervised FL framework, achieving highly accurate and privacy-protected crowdsourced TMI without depending on the availability of massive labeled data. MTSSFL introduces consistency updating to insert the global model in the gradient updates of the local models that only have unlabeled data to improve their training. We also devise mean-teacher-averaging, a secure parameter aggregation mechanism that further boosts the global model’s TMI performance without requiring additional training. Our extensive case studies on a real-world data set demonstrate that MTSSFL’s classification accuracy is merely 1.1% lower than the state-of-the-art semisupervised TMI approach while being the only one to satisfy FL’s privacy-preserving constraints. In addition, MTSSFL can achieve high accuracy with less training overhead due to the proposed semisupervised learning design.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2021.3132056","Stable Support Plan Program of Shenzhen Natural Science Fund(grant numbers:20200925155105002); General Program of Guangdong Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation(grant numbers:2019A1515011032); Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Brain-Inspired Intelligent Computation(grant numbers:2020B121201001); Australia ARC(grant numbers:DP200101374,LP190100676); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9632695","Crowdsourcing;federated learning (FL);intelligent transportation systems (ITSs);semisupervised learning;transportation mode identification (TMI)","Transportation;Training;Global Positioning System;Data models;Trajectory;Deep learning;Computational modeling","","20","","62","IEEE","2 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This straightforward two-stage learning scheme suffers from two weaknesses: (1) the accuracy of inference may be very low; (2) useful information may be lost during inference. In this paper, we proposed a novel ensemble method for learning from crowds. Our proposed method is a meta-learning scheme. It first uses a bootstrapping process to create M sub-datasets from an original crowdsourced labeled dataset. For each sub-dataset, each instance is duplicated with different weights according to the distribution and class memberships of its multiple noisy labels. A base classifier is then trained from this extended sub-dataset. Finally, unlabeled instances are predicted by aggregating the outputs of these M base classifiers. Because the proposed method gets rid of the inference procedure and uses the full dataset to train learning models, it preserves the useful information for learning as much as possible.

Ratings of dialogs are gathered by crowdsourcing through Amazon Mechanical Turk. A reference baseline is provided by a linear regression model (LRM) based on the PARADISE framework. We present two versions of the CF model. First, the item-based collaborative filtering model (ICFM) clusters rated dialogs and builds an LRM for each cluster. The rating of an unseen dialog is predicted by the LRM of its most similar cluster. Second, the extended ICFM (EICFM) separates dialog features into user-related and system-related groups, to build LRMs for these separately. Experimental results on dialogs from the Let's Go! system show both ICFM and EICFM can significantly improve the proportion of variability explained by the LRM.

This provides natural visual representation of nonverbal sounds with rich information about the sound category and dynamics. To evaluate how the animated sound words generated by our framework affect the user experience, we implemented an experimental system and conducted a user study involving over 300 participants from an online crowdsourcing service.

Intuitively, outsourcing data to untrusted cloud commonly raises concerns about data privacy breaches. To combat this, one approach is exploiting Broadcast Based Searchable Encryption (BBSE) for secure data sharing. Nevertheless, the latest proposed BBSE is still defective in either security or efficiency. In this article, we propose ESPD, an Efficient, Scalable and Privacy-preserving Data sharing framework over encrypted cloud dataset. Different from previous works, ESPD supports sharing target data to multiple users with distinct secret keys, and keeps a constant ciphertext length with the changes of the amount of system users. This feature significantly improves search efficiency and makes ESPD scalable in real-world scenarios. We show a formal analysis to prove the security of ESPD in terms of file privacy, keyword privacy and trapdoor privacy. Also, extensive experiments on real-world dataset are conducted to indicate the desirable performance of ESPD compared to other similar schemes.","2168-7161","","10.1109/TCC.2021.3117998","NTU-Desay Research Program(grant numbers:2018-0980); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9560030","Searchable encryption;broadcast;privacy-preserving;scalable","Cloud computing;Servers;Data privacy;Encryption;Privacy;Security;Social networking (online)","","19","","44","IEEE","6 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The tags-image pairs can be used to train automatic image annotation (AIA) systems in accordance with the learning by example paradigm. In previous studies, we had concluded that, on average, 20% of the Instagram hashtags are related to the actual visual content of the image they accompany, i.e., they are descriptive hashtags, while there are many irrelevant hashtags, i.e., stop-hashtags, that are used across totally different images just for gathering clicks and for searchability enhancement. In this paper, we present a novel methodology, based on the principles of collective intelligence that helps in locating those hashtags. In particular, we show that the application of a modified version of the well-known hyperlink-induced topic search (HITS) algorithm, in a crowdtagging context, provides an effective and consistent way for finding pairs of Instagram images and hashtags, which lead to representative and noise-free training sets for content-based image retrieval. As a proof of concept, we used the crowdsourcing platform Figure-eight to allow collective intelligence to be gathered in the form of tag selection (crowdtagging) for Instagram hashtags. The crowdtagging data of Figure-eight are used to form bipartite graphs in which the first type of nodes corresponds to the annotators and the second type to the hashtags they selected. The HITS algorithm is first used to rank the annotators in terms of their effectiveness in the crowdtagging task and then to identify the right hashtags per image.","2329-924X","","10.1109/TCSS.2019.2914080","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8718343","Bipartite graphs;collective intelligence;crowdtagging;FolkRank;hyperlink-induced topic search (HITS) algorithm;image retrieval;image tagging;Instagram hashtags","Tagging;Twitter;Bipartite graph;Task analysis;Image annotation;Crowdsourcing","","19","","47","IEEE","20 May 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It requires that crowdworkers master appropriate skill-sets and commit significant effort for completing a task. Abundant uncertainty may arise during a crowdtesting process due to imperfect information between the task requester and crowdworkers. For example, a worker frequently chooses tasks in an ad hoc manner in crowdtesting context, and an inappropriate task selection may lead to the worker's failing to detect any bugs, and significant testing effort unpaid and wasted. Recent studies have explored methods for supporting task requesters to make informed decisions on task pricing, worker recommendation, and so on. Unfortunately, very few study offers decision making support from the crowdworkers’ perspectives. We motivate this study through a pilot study, revealing the large portion (74 percent) of unpaid crowdworkers’ effort due to the inappropriate task choice. Drawn from our previous work on context-aware crowdworker recommendations, we advocate a more effective alternative to manual task selection would be to provide contextualized and personalized task recommendation considering the diverse distribution of worker preference and expertise, with objectives to increase their winning chances and to potentially reduce the frequency of unpaid crowd work. This paper proposes a context-aware personalized task recommendation approach PTRec, consisting of a testing context model and a learning-based task recommendation model to aid dynamic worker decision in selecting crowdtesting tasks. The testing context model is constructed in two perspectives, i.e., process context and resource context, to capture the in-process progress-oriented information and crowdworkers’ characteristics respectively. Built on top of this context model, the learning-based task recommendation model extracts 60 features automatically, and employs random forest learner to generate dynamic and personalized task recommendation which matches workers’ expertise and interest. The evaluation is conducted on 636 crowdtesting tasks involving 2,404 crowdworkers from one of the largest crowdtesting platforms, and results show our approach can achieve an average precision of 82 percent, average recall of 84 percent, and save an estimated average of 81 percent effort originally spent on exploring, significantly outperforming four commonly-used and state-of-the-art baselines. This indicates its potential in recommending proper tasks to workers so as to improve bug detection efficiency and increase their monetary earnings.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2021.3081171","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2018YFB1403400); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62072442,62002348); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9435104","Crowdsourced testing;task recommendation;testing context model","Task analysis;Computer bugs;Testing;Context modeling;Feature extraction;Crowdsourcing;Videos","","18","","73","IEEE","18 May 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Inspired by fine-grained and relative attributes, we introduce super-fine attributes, which now describe multiple, integral concepts of a single trait as multi-dimensional perceptual coordinates. Crowd prototyping facilitates efficient crowdsourcing of super-fine labels by pre-discovering salient perceptual concepts for prototype matching. We re-annotate gender, age and ethnicity traits from PETA, a highly diverse (19K instances, 8.7K identities) amalgamation of 10 re-id datasets including VIPER, CUHK and TownCentre. Employing joint attribute regression with the ResNet-152 CNN, we demonstrate substantially improved ranked retrieval performance with super-fine attributes in comparison to conventional binary labels, reporting up to a 11.2 and 14.8 percent mAP improvement for gender and age, further surpassed by ethnicity. We also find our 3 super-fine traits to outperform 35 binary attributes by 6.5 percent mAP for subject retrieval in a challenging zero-shot identification scenario.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2018.2836900","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(grant numbers:1513418); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8359307","Attribute-based pedestrian re-identification;soft biometrics;crowdsourcing;retrieval;perception;PETA dataset","Prototypes;Visualization;Face;Surveillance;Face recognition","","18","","58","IEEE","15 May 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

For each methodology, two approaches are proposed for the EV relocation, i.e., the relocation performed by the EV-sharing operators and the relocation involving registered users also with an incentive scheme based on the crowdsourcing concept. In both the methods, two integer linear programming (ILP) problems are formulated to minimize the relocation cost in the two considered approaches. Moreover, in the randomized matheuristic method, a set of smart stations solve local ILP problems to produce a relocation plan. Finally, some instances and a case study are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches for the EVs relocation problem. Note to Practitioners—This article is motivated by the need to optimize the relocation process in the electric vehicle (EV)-sharing systems in order to minimize the relocation costs and guarantee the high quality of the service. To this aim, we first propose a centralized optimization that can be applied by the EV-sharing company for incentivizing users to optimally relocate vehicles in the stations. In this context, both the users and the company obtain benefits. Second, the randomized matheuristic optimization allows the stations to reach a decision about the relocation plan by using local information. The presented strategies can be applied in real applications, and in particular, the randomized matheuristic approach appears a promising strategy for large systems by using limited resources with low computational effort.

Incentives are a fundamental issue in MCS. This paper proposes an integrated incentive framework for MCS, which appropriately utilizes three widely used incentive methods: reverse auction, gamification, and reputation updating. Firstly, a reverse-auction-based two-round participant selection mechanism is proposed to incentivize crowds to actively participate and provide high-quality sensing data. Secondly, in order to avoid untruthful publisher feedback about sensing-data quality, a gamification-based verification mechanism is designed to evaluate the truthfulness of the publisher's feedback. Finally, the platform updates the reputation of both participants and publishers based on their corresponding behaviors. This integrated incentive mechanism can motivate participants to provide high-quality sensed contents, stimulate publishers to give truthful feedback, and make the platform profitable.","1007-0214","","10.1109/TST.2016.7442498","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7442498","mobile crowdsourced sensing;incentive mechanism;reverse auction;gamification;reputation updating","Sensors;Mobile communication;Crowdsourcing;Silicon;Smart phones;Computers","","18","","","","31 Mar 2016","","","TUP","TUP Journals"

First, the proposed system extracts novel integrated features to recognize diverse landmarks. Second, traverse-independent hallway topologies are constructed based on the sensing data, depth data, and images through the proposed hallway construction algorithms.

Additionally, this would eliminate the bias of subjective tests and would avoid bothering the viewers with questions to collect opinions and feedback. The performed analysis relies on two different experiments: i) a crowdsourcing test, where the videos are subject to impairments caused by long initial delays and re-buffering events; ii) a laboratory test, where the videos are affected by blurring effects. The facial Action Units (AU) that represent the contractions of specific facial muscles together with the position of the eyes' pupils are extracted to identify the correlation between perceived quality and facial expressions. An SVM with a quadratic kernel and a k-NN classifier have been tested to predict the QoE from these features. These have also been combined with measured application-level parameters to improve the quality prediction.

However, the involvement of a crowd of volunteers, potentially untrained or nonexperts, implies that VGI can be of varying quality. Tracing VGI provenance enables the recording of the collection activity; the information about who gathered what, where and when can then be employed to judge the VGI quality.

Meanwhile, we were unable to replicate the original study's findings, as text with chart appeared to be no more persuasive - and sometimes less persuasive - than text alone.

Nevertheless, there are two stubborn issues in indoor localization using the fingerprint method, one is the additional localization error caused by heterogeneous devices and the other is the huge time consumed by upgrading the fingerprint database. Here, we propose a dual-frequency difference and cubic spline interpolation (DFD-CSI) localization system in this article. First, according to the characteristics of commercial WiFi router generally supports 2.4- and 5-GHz dual bands, a fingerprint database is established using these two bands' data and their difference data. The existence of difference solves the problem of device heterogeneity, while the existence of dual-frequency data makes the positioning result more robust. In addition, we also use cubic spline interpolation to upgrade the rough fingerprint database in order to reduce the time of site exploration on the premise of ensuring localization accuracy. Extensive experiments have been conducted in a campus hall. Results show that DFD-CSI is robust against altered devices and access points (APs) compared with the traditional heterogeneous devices algorithms and crowdsourcing update methods, achieving a mean error of 3.7 m and 27.5% localization error reduction with APs changed.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2020.2996610","IoT Innovation Team for Talent Promotion Plan of Shannxi Province(grant numbers:2019TD-028); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9098937","Cubic spline interpolation (CSI);dual-frequency difference (DFD);fingerprint database;heterogeneous devices;indoor localization","Fingerprint recognition;Databases;Interpolation;Wireless fidelity;Internet of Things;Splines (mathematics);Crowdsourcing","","16","","33","IEEE","22 May 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, such information is not always available to the public. In this paper, we propose a crowdsourcing approach to solve this problem by exploiting the stop and go events, abbreviated by SG events, of vehicles on roads happening in front of target traffic lights. The PTI discovery problem is formulated by allowing only part of the vehicles participating in the discovery process. The proposed framework starts with discovering SG events, followed by collapsing these events over multiple signal cycles into one and calculating PTI information through a shockwave technique. The crowdsourcing part may be directly implemented on smartphones. The proposed framework was verified via field trials and simulations. Our simulation results showed that, even with a low penetration rate around $3.8$  percent, the root mean square errors of the cycle length, green light and red light signal transition time of a TLS are  $0.04$ , $1.3$  and $5.8$  seconds, respectively.

As an example, transmissions in mobile scenarios (e.g., inside a moving bus) consumes more energy for devices than when accessing from a static environment (e.g., at home). The QoE for the user does not substantially increase when watching high bitrate videos in a vibrating environment (i.e., a moving vehicle), as the context, in this case vehicle’s vibration, affects the perceived QoE. To address this problem, we propose to save energy by considering the context (environment) of video streaming. To model the impact of context, we exploit the embedded accelerometer in smartphones to record the vibration level during video streaming. Based on quality assessment experiments, we collect traces and model the impact of video bitrate and vibration level on QoE, and model the impact of video bitrate and signal strength on power consumption. Based on the QoE model and the power model, we formulate the context-aware and energy-aware video streaming problem as an optimization problem. We present an optimal algorithm which can maximize QoE and minimize energy. Since the optimal algorithm requires perfect knowledge of future tasks, we propose an online bitrate selection algorithm. To further improve the performance of the online algorithm, we propose a crowdsourcing based bitrate selection algorithm. Through real measurements and trace-driven simulations, we demonstrate that the proposed algorithms can significantly outperform existing approaches when considering both energy and QoE.","1558-0660","","10.1109/TMC.2020.3019341","National Science Foundation(grant numbers:CNS-1815465); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9177346","Video streaming;context awareness;energy saving;quality of experience","Streaming media;Quality of experience;Bit rate;Context modeling;Smart phones;Energy consumption;Vibrations","","15","","39","IEEE","25 Aug 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

With a random design on graphs, it is particularly suitable for large scale crowdsourcing experiments on the Internet. However, there still lacks a systematic study about online schemes to deal with the rising streaming and massive data in crowdsourceable scenarios. To fill in this gap, we propose in this paper an online ranking/rating scheme based on stochastic approximation of HodgeRank on random graphs for Quality of Experience (QoE) evaluation, where assessors and rating pairs enter the system in a sequential or streaming way. The scheme is shown in both theory and experiments to be efficient in obtaining global ranking by exhibiting the same asymptotic performance as batch HodgeRank under a general edge-independent sampling process. Moreover, the proposed framework enables us to monitor topological changement and triangular inconsistency in real time. Among a wide spectrum of choices, two particular types of random graphs are studied in detail, i.e., Erdös-Rényi random graph and preferential attachment random graph. The former is the simplest I.I.D. (independent and identically distributed) sampling and the latter may achieve more efficient performance in ranking the top- k items due to its Rich-get-Richer property.

These results do not, however, completely satisfy the user's information need unless they also fulfill the user's intent, i.e., the immediate goal a user seeks to accomplish with video search. Satisfying a user's information need to its full extent poses a particular challenge to video search engines because user intent is often not explicitly reflected in the query. In this paper, we propose a multimodal approach that addresses this challenge by refining the results lists returned by a mainstream video search engine in order to optimally capture user intent. Our approach is based on the insight that the results lists returned by video search engines do contain videos that satisfy user's intent, but that videos with the highest potential for satisfaction are often buried within or scattered over the results list. The proposed approach consists of three steps. In the first step, it analyzes the initial results list to determine the intent distribution pattern. On the basis of this pattern, in the second step, it refines the video search results list such that the top of the list better reveals intent. The third step further improves this refinement by visual reranking, exploiting intent-sensitive lightweight visual features extracted from thumbnails. Extensive evaluation of the approach includes a user study carried out on a crowdsourcing platform and a system-oriented evaluation. Evaluation results demonstrate that our approach leads to a substantial improvement of the information need satisfaction at users.","1941-0077","","10.1109/TMM.2014.2315777","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6783799","Result optimization;user intent;video search","Search engines;Optimization;Visualization;Feature extraction;Materials;Google;Measurement","","15","","42","IEEE","4 Apr 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper we propose a novel image calibration approach destined to monitor the state of a cultural heritage piece taking as information cues photographs of different sources. Our technique aims to surpass the colorimetry difference between pictures taken by different cameras, performing an adaptive linear interpolation having a given display with a set of colours as reference values, thus transforming the initial colour space of any picture to a fixed one. This is performed in the RGB domain. Lastly, the pictures are transformed to the CIELAB space to extract the colour coordinates and measure the overall objective quality of the calibration.

Crowdsourcing by citizens has been proposed as an alternative approach for adaptive data collection that can augment the amount of data collected, as well as bring together the diverse stakeholders and citizens in more participatory water resources management processes. This article first introduces the challenges of designing citizens' campaigns for collecting data on environmental waters. A set of developed mobile phone and web applications is then introduced, integrated within a specific platform, as it was used in the execution of citizens' campaigns for data needed in flood analysis and management. Experiences and lessons learned are presented from the field execution of citizens' campaigns in two pilot areas located in Europe - the Danube Delta in Romania, and the Kifissos catchment in Greece. Two of the campaigns are on river data collection - water levels and water velocities, and two on collecting land use/land cover data. Surveys carried out with campaign participants indicate their appreciation of the initiative, but challenges remain regarding user-friendliness of the applications. Logistic issues such as timing, duration, and pathways for data collection impacted the motivation of participants.

The users' adaptation catalyze a stochastic dynamic process, in which the strategies of users in the community evolve over time. We first characterize the structural properties of the users' best response strategies. Subsequently, using these structural results we design incentive mechanisms based on reputation protocols for governing the online communities, which can “manage” the long-run evolution of the community. We prove that by appropriately penalizing and rewarding users based on their behavior in the community, such incentive mechanisms can eliminate free-riding and ensure that the community converges to a desirable equilibrium selected by the community designer such that social welfare is maximized and in which users find it in their self-interest to cooperate with each other.","1941-0484","","10.1109/JSTSP.2013.2263785","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6525348","Online communities;reputation protocols;stochastically stable equilibrium;strategic adaptation","Communities;Protocols;Games;Servers;Stochastic processes;History;Robustness","","14","","21","IEEE","6 Jun 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A novel frugal sensing scheme was recently proposed as a means of crowdsourcing the task of spectrum sensing. Using a network of scattered low-end sensors transmitting randomly filtered power measurement bits to a fusion center, a non-parametric approach to spectral estimation was adopted to estimate the ambient power spectrum. Here, a parametric spectral estimation approach is considered within the context of frugal sensing. Assuming a Moving-Average (MA) representation for the signal of interest, the problem of estimating admissible MA parameters, and thus the MA power spectrum, from single bit quantized data is formulated. This turns out being a non-convex quadratically constrained quadratic program (QCQP), which is NP-Hard in general. Approximate solutions can be obtained via semi-definite relaxation (SDR) followed by randomization; but this rarely produces a feasible solution for this particular kind of QCQP. A new Sequential Parametric Convex Approximation (SPCA) method is proposed for this purpose, which can be initialized from an infeasible starting point, and yet still produce a feasible point for the QCQP, when one exists, with high probability. Simulations not only reveal the superior performance of the parametric techniques over the globally optimum solutions obtained from the non-parametric formulation, but also the better performance of the SPCA algorithm over the SDR technique.","1941-0476","","10.1109/TSP.2014.2386291","National Science Foundation(grant numbers:ECCS-1231504); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6998085","Cognitive radio;distributed spectrum sensing;parametric spectral analysis;moving-average processes;quantization;quadratically constrained quadratic programming (QCQP);semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation","Sensors;Correlation;Estimation;Approximation methods;Cognitive radio;Power measurement;Mathematical model","","14","","38","IEEE","24 Dec 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Smart parking services enable vehicles to obtain real-time parking information, which has great potential to mitigate the parking problem. Compared with the existing parking methods, the cooperative parking information sharing based on vehicular crowdsourcing has lower cost and higher accuracy. However, vehicles face the threat of identity and trajectory privacy leakage. In order to provide secure and reliable parking service, we propose a secure and reliable smart parking scheme (SRSP) with dual privacy preservation. Specifically, a novel group signature technique can be equipped to achieve anonymous authentication among vehicles, parking server, and fog node. Meanwhile, the mix zone method combined with differential privacy can be utilized to hide the vehicles' trajectory. Moreover, message-lock encryption technique enables fog node to detect and delete duplicated reports to reduce the computational overhead of parking server. An incentive mechanism is proposed, which can not only reward contributing vehicles but also prevent the same vehicle from getting multiple rewards. In addition, the trust model is designed to evaluate the reliability of vehicles based on direct trust and recommendation trust. Finally, security analysis demonstrates that SRSP can achieve security objectives.

As a cost-effective choice, WiFi-based indoor positioning has attracted great increasing research attentions because it does not require external devices installed in the target environment. Although extensive research has been conducted on WiFi fingerprint matching, the problem of automatically adapting radio maps to fresh signal space environment still exists. The traditional methods often conduct site surveys regularly to update the outdated radio maps, which is time consuming and laborious. In this work, we propose an indoor positioning system AAIMSS to automatically update the radio maps based on an enhanced transfer learning (TL) approach with altered access points (APs) identification and mapping space searching. In the system, the proposed TL approach removes the outlier features and then searches a more accurate mapping space between the original radio map and crowdsourcing data. Our lightweight solution does not rely on additional devices and inertial sensors with high-power consumption. A set of experiments has been conducted in a teaching building to evaluate AAIMSS. The results show that this AAIMSS is robust to locate users in a dynamic environment. The average positioning accuracy achieves 2.5m, which significantly outperforms the positioning strategies with the original radio map by 65.3%, the radio map by directly removing the altered APs by 19.4%, and the radio map by the traditional TL by 85.2%.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2020.3048253","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61801189); Science and Technology Development Program of Jilin Province(grant numbers:20200201287JC); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9311240","Crowdsourcing;indoor positioning;transfer learning (TL);weighted K-nearest neighbor (WKNN)","Crowdsourcing;Wireless fidelity;Buildings;Legged locomotion;Servers;Manifolds;Internet of Things","","13","","34","IEEE","30 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In particular, cooperation is critical for vehicle-to-everything (V2X) applications that value quality-of-service foremost. However, cooperation is inefficient without strong trust bases. Recently, blockchain arises as a promising solution to decentralized trust, owing to its transparency and immutability. Therefore, we propose a WSP cooperation framework based on blockchain, which keeps a shared ledger on resource utilization. In this paper, we first study the WSP selection problem of vehicles by evolutionary game. Then, we make the blockchain public to vehicles to maintain its decentralization and enhance its security by crowdsourcing idle computing resources from vehicles. To deal with the mobility of vehicles, as well as to improve the consensus efficiency, we propose delegated proof-of-work (DPoW) scheme, which introduces delegate nodes for participating in the blockchain consensus on behalf of the vehicles. The alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) optimization framework is further used to derive optimal consensus parameters including block size, computing resource demand of delegate nodes, and prices paid for vehicles. We conduct extensive simulations to show the effectiveness of the proposed methods.","1939-9359","","10.1109/TVT.2021.3136364","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61871211,62001259); Innovation and Entrepreneurship of Jiangsu Province High-level Talent Program; Six Top Talents Program of Jiangsu Province; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9655494","Vehicular access;multi-operator cooperation;evolutionary game;blockchain;delegated proof-of-work","Blockchains;Games;Base stations;Internet of Things;Optimization;Bandwidth;Vehicular ad hoc networks","","12","","43","IEEE","17 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Clearly, the visual system does not compute these values as a computer would, as an arithmetic mean or a correlation. Instead, it extracts these patterns using perceptual proxies; heuristic shortcuts of the visual marks, such as a center of mass or a shape envelope. Understanding which proxies people use would lead to more effective visualizations. We present the results of a series of crowdsourced experiments that measure how powerfully a set of candidate proxies can explain human performance when comparing the mean and range of pairs of data series presented as bar charts. We generated datasets where the correct answer-the series with the larger arithmetic mean or range-was pitted against an “adversarial” series that should be seen as larger if the viewer uses a particular candidate proxy. We used both Bayesian logistic regression models and a robust Bayesian mixed-effects linear model to measure how strongly each adversarial proxy could drive viewers to answer incorrectly and whether different individuals may use different proxies. Finally, we attempt to construct adversarial datasets from scratch, using an iterative crowdsourcing procedure to perform black-box optimization.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030429","National Science Foundation(grant numbers:IIS-1901485); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9238508","Perceptual proxies;vision science;crowdsourced evaluation","Visualization;Data visualization;Task analysis;Bars;Visual systems;Data mining;Bayes methods","","12","","51","IEEE","23 Oct 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In many cases, the out-of-date indoor semantic floorplans would gradually deteriorate and even break down the LBS performance. Thus, it is important to automatically update changed semantics of indoor floorplans caused by environmental variation. However, few research has been focused on the continuous semantic updating problem. This paper presents SISE as a mobile crowdsourcing system that uses a new abstraction for indoor general entities and their semantics, enGraph, to automatically update changed semantics of indoor floorplans using images and inertial data. We first propose efficient methods to generate enGraph. Thus, an image can be associated with an indoor semantic floorplan. Accordingly, we formulate the enGraph matching problem and then propose a quality-based maximum common subgraph matching algorithm so that entities extracted from an image can be corresponded to entities in the indoor semantic floorplan. Furthermore, we propose a quadrant comparison algorithm and a region shrink based localization algorithm to detect and localize changed entities. Thus, the new semantics can be labeled and out-of-date semantics can be removed. Extensive experiments have been conducted on real and synthetic data. Experimental results show that 80 percent of out-of-date semantics of indoor general entities can be updated by SISE.","1558-0660","","10.1109/TMC.2018.2812752","National Natural Science Foundation of China; Outstanding Excellent Young Scholars of China(grant numbers:61422214); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61772544,71471175,71690233,71331008,61602499,61471371); National Basic Research Program (973 program)(grant numbers:2014CB347800); Hunan Provincial Natural Science; Distinguished Young Scholars(grant numbers:2016JJ1002); Guangxi Cooperative Innovation Center of Cloud Computing and Big Data(grant numbers:YD16507,YD17X11); National Postdoctoral Program for Innovative Talents(grant numbers:BX201600172); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8307177","Indoor semantic floorplan;crowdsourcing;self-updating system","Semantics;Image recognition;Crowdsourcing;Indoor environments;Mobile computing;Buildings;Layout","","12","","50","IEEE","6 Mar 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

IC-IoT is built on top of named data networking (NDN), a content-centric Internet paradigm whose features are particularly promising for certain IoT applications, such as smart grid. In IC-IoT, privacy is one of the most challenging issues. Among existing privacy-preserving approaches, differential privacy (DP) is a powerful tool that can provide privacy-preserving noisy query answers over statistical databases and has been widely adopted in many practical fields. In particular, as an enhanced implementation of DP, randomized aggregable privacy-preserving ordinal response (RAPPOR) can achieve strong privacy, high-efficiency, and high-utility guarantees for each client string in data crowdsourcing. However, in many IoT applications like smart grid, data are often processed in batches. Developing a new random response algorithm that can support batch-processing will make it more efficient and suitable for IoT applications than existing random response algorithms. In this paper, we propose a new randomized response algorithm that can achieve differential-privacy and utility guarantees for consumer's behaviors and can process one batch of data at each time. First, by applying sparse coding in this algorithm, a behavior signature dictionary is created from the aggregated energy consumption data in IoT. Then, we add noise into the behavior signature dictionary by the classical randomized response techniques to achieve the differential privacy after data re-aggregation. Through security analysis with the principle of differential privacy and experimental performance evaluation, we prove that our proposed algorithm can preserve consumer's privacy without compromising utility.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2876707","Major Technical Innovation Project of Hubei(grant numbers:2018AAA046); Wuhan Applied Basic Research Project(grant numbers:2017060201010162); Natural Science Foundation of Beijing Municipality(grant numbers:4182060); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8496764","IoT;information-centric network;differential privacy;randomized response;sparse coding;smart grid","Encoding;Smart grids;Privacy;Energy consumption;Crowdsourcing","","12","","47","OAPA","18 Oct 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To deal with this problem, in this paper we propose to exploit opportunistic transmission and the idea of crowdsourcing to offload mobile video traffic. Based on this idea, a Quality of VIDEO (QoV) oriented pricing incentive scheme, namely Vbargain, is proposed to stimulate mobile users to deliver video data collaboratively. More specifically, in our scheme, the network is regarded as a Virtual Market, and the video packets are treated as commodities, which are dynamically priced according to their expected marginal gains on the quality of reconstructed video; the process of video delivery is regarded as a sequence of packet transactions which are modeled as two-person cooperative games. Driven by the profit-hunting nature of mobile users, the video data is delivered from the source to its destination. In order to gain deep insight into our scheme, we also analyze the overhead and the influence of start-up capital on the performance of video delivered theoretically, and give its lower bound and upper bound. Our simulation results, based on both the synthetic and real-life traces of mobile users, verify the efficiency of our scheme and analysis.","1558-0660","","10.1109/TMC.2017.2771258","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61332005,61632008,61772175); Funds for Creative Research Groups of China(grant numbers:61421061); National Science Foundation(grant numbers:ECCS-1408601,CNS-1205726); U.S. Air Force(grant numbers:FA9453-15-C-0423); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8100954","Incentive;video delivery;mobile video offloading;crowdsourcing","Mobile communication;Mobile computing;Streaming media;Incentive schemes;Device-to-device communication;Crowdsourcing;Pricing","","12","","35","IEEE","9 Nov 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Crowdsourced workers perform tasks on crowdsourcing platforms and present their experiences as test reports, which naturally generates an overwhelming number of test reports. Therefore, inspecting these reports becomes a time-consuming yet inevitable task. In recent years, many text-based prioritization and clustering techniques have been proposed to address this challenge. However, in mobile testing, test reports often consist of only short test descriptions but rich screenshots. Compared with the uncertainty of textual information, well-defined screenshots can often adequately express the mobile application’s activity views. In this paper, by employing image-understanding techniques, we propose an approach for clustering crowdsourced test reports of mobile applications based on both textual and image features to assist the inspection procedure. We employ Spatial Pyramid Matching (SPM) to measure the similarity of the screenshots and use the natural-language-processing techniques to compute the textual distance of test reports. To validate our approach, we conducted an experiment on 6 industrial crowdsourced projects that contain more than 1600 test reports and 1400 screenshots. The results show that our approach is capable of outperforming the baselines by up to 37 percent regarding the APFD metric. Further, we analyze the parameter sensitivity of our approach and discuss the settings for different application scenarios.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2020.3017514","National Key R&D Program of China(grant numbers:2018YFB1403400); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61772263,61772014); Collaborative Innovation Center of Novel Software Technology and Industrialization; Suzhou Technology Development Plan(grant numbers:SYG201807); Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9174926","Crowdsourced testing;mobile testing;test report processing","Testing;Task analysis;Mobile applications;Computer bugs;Software;Mars;Mobile handsets","","12","","78","IEEE","24 Aug 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
