The knowledge sharing between these two types of open source communities can be very beneficial to both of them. However, it is a great challenge to automate this process. Current studies mainly focus on knowledge acquisition in one type of community, and few of them have tackle this problem efficiently. In this paper we take Android Issue Tracker and Stack Overflow as a case to study the mutual knowledge sharing between them. We propose an automatic approach by integrating semantic similarity with temporal locality between Android issues and Stack Overflow posts based on the internal citation-graph to reveal the potential associations between them. Our approach explores the internal citations in communities for closely related posts or issues clustering, exploits the rich semantics in fine-grained information of issues and posts for associations building, and leverages the temporal correlations between issues and posts in-depth for associations ranking. Extensive experiments show that the precision of our approach reaches 62.51 percent for top 10 recommendations when recommending Stack Overflow posts to Android issues, and 66.83 percent in reverse.","1939-1374","","10.1109/TSC.2015.2473847","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61432020,61472430,61502512); National High Technology Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2012AA011201); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7226861","Knowledge sharing;citation-graph;semantic similarity;temporal locality;android issue tracker;stack overflow","Androids;Humanoid robots;Semantics;Software;Service computing;Correlation;Training","","8","","33","IEEE","27 Aug 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
"An Indian logic-based argument representation formalism for knowledge-sharing 1","G. S. Mahalakshmi; T. V. Geetha",NA; NA,Logic Journal of the IGPL,"18 Jan 2018","2009","17","1","55","76","Knowledge-sharing is the fundamental aspect of learning from ancient days. By exchanging questions and answers in a debate fashion, knowledge is explored. Argumentation can be thought of as a knowledge-sharing mechanism where construction of arguments and counter-arguments towards reaching mutually agreed upon conclusions is modelled after the rational discussion of knowledge-sharing. The procedural approach of generation and exchange of arguments is with the intention of reaching a definite conclusion at the end of discussion irrespective of the winning or losing of the individual arguments. A procedural argumentation system for knowledge-sharing, similar to the one discussed above will be of immense use only when the representational facts of world knowledge are well captured and represented as identical with the representation of natural intelligence. Indian Philosophy suggests various rules for classifying and representing the world knowledge to enhance the procedure of argumentation in reaching new inferences. This paper discusses a new mathematical model that caters to the special requirements of classification and hypothetical argumentative reasoning (tarka) of Indian philosophy. The main focus is the emphasis given to the existence of relations between concepts and foundation of invariable connection between concepts/relations of the arguments that is indicated by the philosophy. The extracted knowledge from the arguments exchanged is captured using ‘Indianised logics’, an Indian Logic based argument representation formalism. The arguments are deeply analysed for the presence of conceptual and relational conflicts. This is achieved by referring to the presence and/or absence of invariable concomitance, so that, the decision of justifying the represented invalid knowledge with or without proof shall be made clear in knowledge-sharing through rational discussion.","1368-9894","","10.1093/jigpal/jzn026","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8144525","Mathematical model;Knowledge representation;Procedural argumentation;Logic;Indian philosophy;Knowledge-sharing and Argument","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

However, little is known whether revision-related badges have a negative impact on the quality of revisions since some studies show that certain users may game incentive systems to gain rewards. In this study, we analyze 3,871,966 revision records that are collected from 2,377,692 Stack Overflow answers. We find that: 1) Users performed a much larger than usual revisions on the badge-awarding days compared to normal days; 25% of the users did not make any more revisions once they received their first revision-related badge. 2) Performing more revisions than usual in a single day increased the likelihood of such revisions being rolled back (e.g., due to undesired or incorrect revisions). 3) Users were more likely to perform text and small revisions if they performed many revisions in a single day. Our findings are concurred by the Stack Overflow community, and they highlight the need for changes to the current badge system in order to provide a better balance between the quality and quantity of revisions.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2018.2874470","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8485395","Stack overflow;incentive system;badge;answer revision","Atmospheric measurements;Particle measurements;Games;Indexes;Knowledge engineering;Software;Computer science","","28","","44","IEEE","7 Oct 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

"Facilitating Knowledge Sharing Through a Boundary Spanner","Y. Peng; J. Sutanto","Alstom, Baden, Switzerland; Department of Management Technology and Economics, ETH Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland",IEEE Transactions on Professional Communication,"22 May 2012","2012","55","2","142","155","Research problem: The purpose of the study was to explore how a boundary spanner can successfully facilitate knowledge sharing across functional and geographical boundaries. The main research questions are: (1) Does matching the complexity of knowledge boundary with the knowledge-sharing process lead to successful knowledge sharing? and (2) What are the key factors that influence a boundary spanner when deciding how to facilitate the knowledge sharing across functional and location boundaries? Literature review: The purpose of the literature review was to better understand the existing knowledge-sharing frameworks. Finding no framework that can directly address the research problem, the researchers decided to build on the closest one which is a framework for knowledge sharing across functional boundaries. By not taking into consideration knowledge sharing across location boundaries, the framework assumes collocated and synchronous knowledge-sharing interaction. To understand the potential supporting media for knowledge-sharing interaction across functional and geographical boundaries, the researchers consulted the Media Naturalness Theory. Media naturalness is the ability of the media to support a sense of collocated and synchronous interaction. Methodology: The researchers conducted a qualitative exploratory case study in the IT department of a Fortune 500 multinational finance company. Researchers selected a boundary spanner and observed her facilitation of knowledge-sharing interactions for four months. A total of 78 knowledge-sharing interaction logs were collected during the period of observation from five data sources: wiki, email, instant messaging, teleconference, and face-to-face interactions. Data analysis was carried out through template coding. Results and discussion: The researchers found that matching the knowledge boundary with the knowledge-sharing process is an essential yet insufficient condition for successful knowledge sharing. A boundary spanner should also pay attention to the boundary objects and media used to support the knowledge-sharing interaction. Spatial dispersion and knowledge commonality between the source/recipient and boundary spanner affected the media selection which, in turn, influenced the selection of the boundary objects. The implication of the study is that there are three important factors that the boundary spanner should consider when deciding how to facilitate knowledge sharing (i.e., knowledge boundary, spatial dispersion, and knowledge commonality). The main limitations of the study were the relatively short observation period of the knowledge-sharing interactions via a boundary spanner. Future research should quantitatively validate the proposed optimal knowledge-sharing designs to test the generalizability of the findings with a survey and profile deviation analysis.","1558-1500","","10.1109/TPC.2012.2188590","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6178031","Boundary objects;boundary spanner;knowledge sharing;media","Media;Companies;Complexity theory;Context;Electronic mail;Internet","","13","","41","IEEE","5 Apr 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The ability of an organization to manage its organizational knowledge, specifically in the context of knowledge sharing, may enhance the organization’s overall performance. Various approaches and technologies have been introduced to assist the process in achieving that target. Ontology as one of the knowledge representation methods has been becoming popular to assist knowledge sharing in the organization. Previous reviews have mainly focused on general KM issues, with little emphasis on the use of ontology in knowledge sharing. Thus, this article reviews several ontology-based KM tools that can support knowledge-sharing activities to provide some insight into future research in this area. Thirteen ontology-based KM tools were reviewed using ten elements’ comparison criteria: the motivation, domain, source of knowledge, type of knowledge, knowledge extraction, knowledge input process, knowledge retrieval process, knowledge sharing technology, source of ontology component, and ontology methodology. The review found that several elements can be further studied to improve KM implementation in the organization, especially on the knowledge sharing dimension. This includes simplifying the knowledge extraction and retrieval process to explore various knowledge domains from implicit knowledge sources. The review’s outcome also includes proposed components and functions of an ideal ontology-based KM tool.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3163758","Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia(grant numbers:GP-2019-K006906); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9745581","Knowledge;knowledge management;knowledge sharing;ontology;organization","Knowledge management;Ontologies;Information sharing;Systematics;Bibliographies;Market research","","18","","83","CCBY","31 Mar 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

"Incorporating user appropriation, media richness, and collaborative knowledge sharing into blended e-learning training tutorial","C. Baehr","Department of English, Texas Tech University, Lubbock, TX, USA",IEEE Transactions on Professional Communication,"22 May 2012","2012","55","2","175","184","Problem: E-learning has become a standard in many organizations to train its workforce and build an information network that encourages collaborative knowledge sharing. As a result of technological and global factors, the complexity of delivering successful e-learning courses and products is an increasing challenge for subject matter experts and instructional designers. Online training courses have become blended learning environments, comprised of synchronous and asynchronous modes of delivery, multiple media forms, and global and localized audiences to meet the demands and flexibility it affords. Successful blended e-learning is more than simply mixing online and live instructional modes; it can also include a combination of multiple media types, technologies, and communication modes. E-learners have become multimodal learners, with the ability to adapt to multiple media forms, environment types, and tools. Key concepts: Understanding the complex interaction of technology use, collaborative knowledge sharing, and media can facilitate more effective communication exchanges between instructor, content, and learner. Some concepts that help describe the complexities of blended e-learning include technological appropriation, technological accommodation, media richness, media synchronicity and naturalness, blended e-learning, and collaborative knowledge sharing. Key lessons: Research trends suggest learners appropriate technology and media forms, and evaluate usefulness based on a range of factors, including richness, experience, perception, and recommendation. Blended learning environments add complexity by mixing spatial (distributed and colocated) and temporal (asynchronous and synchronous) components with increased levels of collaborative knowledge sharing. From these research trends, the following best practices for developing e-learning are recommended: (1) consider media richness factors and user preferences in media and tool selection; (2) encourage personalization to foster trust; (3) facilitate collaborative knowledge sharing both inside and outside the training setting; (4) balance roles as knowledge facilitator, coach, and information manager; and (5) invest additional time in both course and instructor preparation. Implications: Blended e-learning presents a number of challenges for subject matter experts and designers of instructional content. Subject matter experts must consult with instructional designers and consider the different media platforms, environments, and formats that optimize the best pairing of content with delivery mode and media type. Content experts and designers must collaborate on methods of effectively adapting course content to account for perceived richness, user experience, and task complexity. Instructors must also invest additional time in planning and accounting for user preferences and communication practices in online training.","1558-1500","","10.1109/TPC.2012.2190346","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6189768","Blended e-learning;media richness;online training","Media;Training;Electronic learning;Collaboration;Complexity theory;Electronic mail;Tutorials","","23","","22","IEEE","25 Apr 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Moderation and moderated mediation of psychological capital (PsyCap) in the direct and indirect relationship between abusive supervision and knowledge sharing is also tested. Using a multiwave and multisource survey, data are collected from 239 subordinate–supervisor dyads in Indian project organizations. Our research results suggest that employees with abusive leaders suffer a loss of psychological safety which in turn demotivates knowledge sharing behavior. Furthermore, the effects of abusive supervision on knowledge sharing are moderated by PsyCap such that the negative impact is alleviated by high PsyCap. Most significantly, the moderated mediation findings show that the mediated relationship is contingent on the level of PsyCap, such that the negative influence of hostile behaviors of supervisors on knowledge sharing via psychological safety is attenuated by low PsyCap. The findings of the study suggest that organizations should invest time and effort in preventing abusive supervision in the workplace and enhancing psychological safety. Clear policies, well-developed communication systems, and active involvement of employees go a long way in building a psychologically safe working environment. Given the importance of PsyCap in influencing psychological safety and knowledge sharing, organizations should pay attention to screening for personal resources in addition to knowledge, skills, and abilities.

Knowledge-sharing websites have become a popular resource for obtaining instant and searchable answers. However, users of these sites may encounter challenges in acquiring timely and appropriate content from user-provided answers owing to factors such as limited expertise, spam, and time constraints. Identifying trustworthy experts who can provide relevant and reliable answers in knowledge-sharing communities is crucial to overcome this issue. In this study, we propose a solution to the problem of identifying credible experts on knowledge-sharing sites by introducing the CredibleExpertRank algorithm. Our algorithm calculates a CredibleExpert score based on two main factors: activity and credibility. The credibility score is determined by analyzing users’ interactions related to questioning, answering, recommending, and mining users’ opinions, while the activity score reflects the user’s level of participation on the platform. We conducted experiments to evaluate the performance of the CredibleExpertRank algorithm, using user satisfaction measures for answers to given questions. Our findings confirmed that the credible experts identified by our algorithm provided more relevant and timely answers compared to other ordinary users. The timely nature of the credible experts’ answers was due to the reflection of their activity factor, while the superior performance in relevance was attributed to the high recommendation rate of their answers and positive evaluations received from opinion mining results. Our study undertakes an extensive investigation focused on the identification and prioritization of credible experts, revealing their profound advantages in significantly enhancing the overall quality of knowledge-sharing platforms. We proposed the CredibleExpertRank algorithm as a powerful method for effectively identifying trustworthy experts and giving priority to their answers. Through a meticulous process of experimental evaluation, we provide compelling evidence that this approach leads to substantial improvements in both search efficiency and reliability on knowledge-sharing sites. By highlighting the potential benefits derived from the identification of credible experts, our study underscores their pivotal role in elevating the overall performance of knowledge-sharing platforms.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3281412","Agency for Defense Development Grant funded by the Korean Government(grant numbers:2600-2636-300); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10138544","Knowledge sharing;social network analysis;opinion mining;expert recommendation system;social big data;social influence;ratings prediction;data mining","Recommender systems;Big Data;Social networking (online);Expert systems;Knowledge transfer;Data mining;Predictive models;Social factors","","1","","50","CCBYNCND","30 May 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

One of the important notions in the management and development of the supply chain is the implementation of supplier development program. Previous extensive literature review has identified various types of activity in the supplier development program, which categorized as low involvement activity to high involvement activity. Further, extensive literatures on supplier development program implementation and its implication on supplier’s capability are also available. However, there is still limited empirical research for investigating the determinants of knowledge sharing effectiveness in supplier development programs. Aimed at bridging that gap, this study attempts to investigating the role of supplier’s organizational culture, information and communication technology (ICT), and perceived behavioral control as the determinants of knowledge sharing effectiveness by mentorship in the supplier development program (SD). A survey questionnaire was employed to collect data from 200 suppliers after conducting mentorship training at the suppliers’ site. The data were analyzed using bootstrap resampling method (with 5,000 resamples). The bootstrap samples are used to estimate the Partial Least Square (PLS) path model. The results of path analysis indicated that all variables are significantly associated with knowledge sharing effectiveness with mentoring mechanism (p-values< 0.05) except collaborative culture to knowledge sharing effectiveness which was insignificant. It was also observed that ICT and perceived behavioral control affected the effectiveness of knowledge sharing by mentorship in the SD program.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3052193","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9328110","Supplier development;knowledge sharing;mentorship","Companies;Technological innovation;Supply chains;Information and communication technology;Knowledge transfer;Mentoring","","","","52","CCBY","18 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Since there are close connections between point clouds captured from different viewpoints, registration performance can be enhanced if these connections be harnessed properly. Therefore, this article models the registration problem as multi-task optimization, and proposes a novel bi-channel knowledge sharing mechanism for effective and efficient problem solving. The modeling of multi-view point cloud registration as multi-task optimization are twofold. By simultaneously considering the local accuracy of two point clouds as well as the global consistency posed by all the point clouds involved, a fitness function with an adaptive threshold is derived. Also a framework of the co-evolutionary search process is defined for the concurrent optimization of multiple fitness functions belonging to related tasks. To enhance solution quality and convergence speed, the proposed bi-channel knowledge sharing mechanism plays its role.

Nomadic knowledge is enacted in a discontinuous pattern with a changing set of actors and further flows on a defined trajectory. This knowledge is quite important but is required sporadically, so it has a varying level of importance for stakeholders at different instances of time. The limited interest of knowledge holders after the creation of this type of knowledge makes its sharing process complex. Furthermore, new sets of actors overloaded with tasks often ignore the knowledge sharing aspect of nomadic knowledge due to the urgency of the tasks at hand. Using a long-term field study, we illustrate practices concerning the sharing of nomadic knowledge, which, we argue, are to date not yet well supported technologically. The objective of this contribution is, therefore, to outline the concept of nomadic knowledge and associated implications, so that respective knowledge sharing practices can be supported by the knowledge management community with appropriate technology. The underlying complexity of knowledge sharing practices highlighted in this paper stresses the need for appropriate technological and social processes to facilitate the sharing of nomadic knowledge.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2916903","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8715497","Knowledge management;knowledge sharing;international collaboration;knowledge engineering;organizational aspects","Organizations;Knowledge engineering;Knowledge transfer;Task analysis;Collaborative work;Europe","","5","","82","OAPA","15 May 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Theoretical explanations of knowledge sharing in roadmapping are underdeveloped, with only limited insights into the relationship between individuals’ knowledge (at the micro level) and organizational-level outcomes. This article uses a multilevel lens to examine knowledge sharing in two roadmapping projects empirically. The analysis identifies five mechanisms that enable or constrain knowledge sharing in roadmapping: 1) a neutral space for face-to-face interactions between individuals that fosters; 2) a positive disposition of individuals to share knowledge, together with (3) imperatives to trigger knowledge contributions. Individually shared knowledge is transformed into collective outcomes via 4) shared meanings and 5) shared commitment to act. The analysis also highlights the important role of the facilitator in relation to knowledge sharing. This article extends the theoretical understanding of individuals and their behavior in the roadmapping process. In doing so, it demonstrates how microlevel actions relate to macrolevel outcomes. Practitioners, including facilitators, can use these insights as they design and deliver roadmapping interventions to improve knowledge sharing and, therefore, better strategic outcomes.","1558-0040","","10.1109/TEM.2021.3052974","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9353668","Knowledge management;knowledge sharing;microfoundations;roadmapping","Conferences;Interviews;Organizations;Vehicles;Vocabulary;Technological innovation;Shape","","5","","78","IEEE","12 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, we analyze the online social network (OSN) in Yahoo! Answers. Based on a large amount of our collected data, we studied the OSN’s structural properties, which reveals strikingly distinct properties such as low link symmetry and weak correlation between indegree and outdegree. After studying the knowledge base and behaviors of the users, we find that a small number of top contributors answer most of the questions in the system. Also, each top contributor focuses only on a few knowledge categories. In addition, the knowledge categories of the users are highly clustered. We also study the knowledge base in a user’s social network, which reveals that the members in a user’s social network share only a few knowledge categories. Based on the findings, we provide guidance in the design of spammer detection algorithms and distributed Q&A systems. We also propose a friendship-knowledge oriented Q&A framework that synergistically combines current OSN-based Q&A and web Q&A.

Emerging big data and Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies show significant advantages and efficiency for knowledge sharing among intelligent vehicles. However, it is challenging to guarantee the security and privacy of knowledge during the sharing process. Moreover, conventional AI-based algorithms cannot work properly in distributed vehicular networks. In this paper, a hierarchical blockchain framework and a hierarchical federated learning algorithm are proposed for knowledge sharing, by which vehicles learn environmental data through machine learning methods and share the learning knowledge with each others. The proposed hierarchical blockchain framework is feasible for the large scale vehicular networks. The hierarchical federated learning algorithm is designed to meet the distributed pattern and privacy requirement of IoVs. Knowledge sharing is then modeled as a trading market process to stimulate sharing behaviours, and the trading process is formulated as a multi-leader and multi-player game. Simulation results show that the proposed hierarchical algorithm can improve the sharing efficiency and learning quality.

We propose a secure and efficient blockchain based knowledge sharing framework, wherein a distributed learning based scheme is utilized to enhance the efficiency of knowledge sharing and a directed acyclic graph (DAG) system is designed to guarantee the security of shared learning models. To cater for the time-intense demand of highly dynamic vehicular networks, a lightweight DAG is designed to reduce the operation latency in terms of fast consensus and authentication. Moreover, to further enhance model accuracy as well as minimizing bandwidth consumption, an adaptive asynchronous distributed learning (ADL) based scheme is proposed for model uploading and downloading. Experiment results show that the DAG based framework is lightweight and secure, which reduces both chosen and confirmation delay as well as resisting malicious attacks.

"Knowledge-Sharing Strategies of University-Industry Alliances Promoting Green Technology Innovation in Ecosystems: Based on the Utility of Multichannel Funding","H. Yi; Q.

To improve GTI, university-industry alliances (U-Is) in green innovation ecosystems engage in knowledge-sharing behaviors and form different knowledge-sharing strategies based on changes in cooperation modes. Employing a differential game, this study explores the utility of multichannel funding for innovation revenues in different cooperative modes of U-Is and the impact on revenue distributions. This article considers three game models in five cases: Nash noncooperative game with no multichannel funding, Nash noncooperative game with external funding but no government subsidies, Nash noncooperative game with multichannel funding, Stackelberg game, and cooperative game. Solving the game model and applying the numerical analysis results in certain interesting conclusions. Our research finds that, first, in the cooperative game, the strongest willingness to share knowledge occurs in the university-industry alliance, in which the total revenues of both parties reach the Pareto optimum. Second, multichannel funding can serve as an incentive mechanism for enterprises and universities to improve the knowledge-sharing willingness, the GTI level, and the revenues of the two players, while the utility of the multichannel funding is strongest in the cooperative game. In addition, in the Stackelberg game, enterprises share subsidies with universities, which stimulates their willingness to share knowledge, and both parties’ revenues are better than they are in the three cases of noncooperation. Eventually, the revenue-sharing ratio of the enterprise has a smaller threshold, and the university can share more benefits relative to the absence of the multichannel funding, which helps balance the U-I in the green innovation ecosystem. These conclusions make a substantial contribution to the selection of cooperation modes and the formulation of revenues distribution contracts in university-industry alliances.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3184422","National Social Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:20XGL030); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9800973","University-industry;multichannel funding;green technology innovation;knowledge sharing;green innovation ecosystem","Technological innovation;Green products;Games;Ecosystems;Biological system modeling;Government;Investment","","8","","46","CCBY","20 Jun 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A Classification-guided Module (CGM)-based discriminator with knowledge from EMRs is set against a generator to offer a promising result for each mask from the inexperienced participant of federated ML. After an iterative communication between the federated server and its clients for knowledge sharing, the segmented sub-image owns a coincident attribute distribution with that of the EMRs from the experts. Besides, the adversarial network augment the data to normalize the data distribution for all the clients as a remission for none independent identically distributed (non-IID) data problem.

Data sharing is one option to address these issues, but it is generally impractical because of privacy concerns or due to the problematic process of finding a sharing agreement. Instead, this work considers knowledge sharing by first exchanging the weights of pretrained DNNs and then applying transfer learning (TL). Specifically, it addresses the economics of knowledge sharing in AI services by taking a market-based approach. In detail, a model based on Fisher’s market is devised for optimal knowledge sharing, defined as the gain in inference accuracy from exchanging DNN weights. The proposed approach is shown to reach a market equilibrium and to satisfy important economic properties, including Pareto optimality. A technique for weight fusion is also introduced to merge acquired knowledge with the existing one. Finally, an extensive evaluation is conducted in a distributed intelligence scenario. The obtained results show that the proposed solution is efficient and that weight fusion with TL significantly increases inference accuracy compared to the original DNN, without the overhead of federated learning.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2022.3206585","Academy of Finland(grant numbers:326346,332307); European Commission through the Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions COFUND REDI Project(grant numbers:101034328); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9891736","Artificial intelligence (AI);Fisher market;game theory;knowledge sharing;smart services;weight trading","Economics;Resource management;Transfer learning;Training;Knowledge engineering;Smart manufacturing;Object detection","","1","","44","IEEE","14 Sep 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Instead of taking data related to question-answer only into account as done in manual process, this model takes both question-answer and answerers' data into account, which gives an insight view into the answers given by the experts that is more likely to be selected as the best answer.

The major problem with CQA lies in identifying the authoritative users in the domain of the question so as to route the question to right experts and selecting the best answer etc. The existing work suffers from one or more limitations such as: 1) lack of automatic mechanism to distinguish between authoritative and non-authoritative users in specified topics; 2) the high dependence on its training data in supervised learning which is too time-consuming process to obtain labeled samples of data manually; and 3) some approaches rely on using some cutoff parameters to estimate an authority score. In this paper, a parameterless mixture model approach is proposed to identify topical authoritative users to overcome the above-mentioned limitations. The statistical framework based on multivariate beta mixtures is utilized on feature vector of users' which is composed of information related to user activities on CQA site. The probability density function is therefore devised and the beta mixture component that corresponds to the most authoritative user is identified. The suitability of the proposed approach is illustrated on real data of two CQA sites: StackOverflow and AskUbuntu. The result shows that the proposed model is remarkable in identifying the authoritative users in comparison with conventional classifiers and Gaussian mixture model.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2016.2609279","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7565520","Authoritative user;beta mixture model;community question answering (CQA);classification;machine learning","Knowledge discovery;Mixture models;Probability density control;Training data;Supervised learning;Gaussian mixture model;Machine learning;Classification;Questioning answering","","14","","42","OAPA","13 Sep 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Thus, this paper aims to examine the influence of outside-in OI on innovation performance considering the mediating roles of knowledge sharing and innovation strategy.

To enable auditable and delay-sensitive IoT services, these knowledge will be shared among decentralized intelligent network edges (DINEs), end users, and supervisors frequently. Blockchain has a promising ability to provide a traceable, privacy-preserving and tamper-resistant ledger for sharing edge knowledge. However, due to the complicated environments of network edges, knowledge sharing among DINEs still faces many challenges. Firstly, the resource limitation and mobility of DINEs impede the applicability of existing consensus tricks (e.g., Poof of Work, Proof of Stake, and Paxos) of blockchain. Secondly, the adversaries may eavesdrop the content of edge knowledge or entice the blockchain to forks using some attacking models (like man-in-the-middle attack, denial of services, etc.). In this article, an user-centric blockchain (UCB) framework is proposed for preserving edge knowledge sharing in IoT. Significant superiorities of UCB benefit from the proof of popularity (PoP) consensus mechanism, which is more energy-efficient and fast.

Since how to build up an effective and accurate model within a limited time is an important issue, especially for complex environments, this paper introduces a model-based reinforcement learning method based on a tree structure to achieve efficient modeling and less memory consumption. The proposed algorithm tailored a Dyna-Q architecture to multiagent systems by means of a tree structure for modeling. The tree-model built from real experiences is used to generate virtual experiences such that the elapsed time in learning could be reduced. As well, this model is suitable for knowledge sharing. This paper is inspired by the concept of knowledge sharing methods in multiagent systems where an agent could construct a global model from scattered local models held by individual agents. Consequently, it can increase modeling accuracy so as to provide valid simulated experiences for indirect learning at the early stage of learning. To simplify the sharing process, the proposed method applies resampling techniques to grafting partial branches of trees containing required and useful experiences disseminated from experienced peers, instead of merging the whole trees. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed sharing method can achieve the objectives of sample efficiency and learning acceleration in multiagent cooperation applications.","2168-2275","","10.1109/TCYB.2014.2341582","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6871355","Decision tree;Dyna-Q;model sharing;multiagent system;Decision tree;Dyna-Q;model sharing;multiagent system","Planning;Support vector machine classification;Vectors;Multi-agent systems;Mathematical model;Stochastic processes;Decision trees","","20","","20","IEEE","5 Aug 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We propose to analyze members' web surfing data to summarize the fine-grained knowledge acquired by them. A two-step framework is proposed for mining fine-grained knowledge: (1) web surfing data is clustered into tasks by a nonparametric generative model; (2) a novel discriminative infinite Hidden Markov Model is developed to mine fine-grained aspects in each task. Finally, the classic expert search method is applied to the mined results to find proper members for knowledge sharing. Experiments on web surfing data collected from our lab at UCSB and IBM show that the fine-grained aspect mining framework works as expected and outperforms baselines.

In practical applications, a large number of data are employed for fault analysis. However, the performance of the fault diagnosis model varies with the sampling frequency of the training data. Theoretically, higher sampling frequency (HSF) data contains much richer fault information, the model trained with HSF data has a better performance compared with that of lower sampling frequency (LSF). However, most of the intelligent methods only focused on the bearing fault diagnosis at a specific data sampling frequency. They did not take into account the impact of different sampling frequencies on fault diagnosis performance. To this end, a novel knowledge-sharing multi-task (KSMT) model is proposed in this article. The KSMT model consists of two task branches, which can automatically share useful features from the task with HSF input (HSF-task) to the task with LSF input (LSF-task) by a feature selection and fusion module (FSF-module). The effectiveness of the proposed model is verified on a rolling bearing dataset. Experimental results show that the performance of the LSF-task can be improved by the proposed knowledge-sharing mechanism. Compared with other state-of-the-art methods, the KSMT model has a better performance and the results can effectively demonstrate that the KMST model can overcome the limitation of less information on fault diagnosis performance.","1557-9662","","10.1109/TIM.2023.3265088","Sichuan Science and Technology Program(grant numbers:2020JDJQ0037); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10093983","Different sampling frequencies;fault diagnosis;feature selection and fusion module (FSF-module);knowledge sharing;multitask learning","Fault diagnosis;Task analysis;Feature extraction;Multitasking;Fault detection;Rolling bearings;Convolutional neural networks","","6","","34","IEEE","6 Apr 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

For adapting to these differences, it is appropriate to design networks with proper representational capacities and construct neural layers with corresponding widths. Nevertheless, most of the state-of-the-art methods pay little attention to such situations, and actually fail to handle the disparities.

The framework of TRMTL is flexible, which is not only capable of sharing knowledge across heterogenous networks but also able to jointly learn tasks with varied input sizes, significantly improving performances of data-insufficient tasks.

Previous work analyzed how asker- and question-related features affect the question quality (QQ) regarding the amount of attention from users, the number of answers and the question solving latency, but neglect the correlation between QQ and AQ (measured by the rating of the best answer), which is critical to quality of service (QoS). We handle this problem from two aspects. First, we additionally use QQ in measuring AQ, and analyze the correlation between a comprehensive list of features (including answer-related features) and QQ. Second, we propose the first method that estimates the probability for a given question to obtain high AQ. Our analysis on the Yahoo! Answers trace confirmed that the list of our identified features exert influence on AQ, which determines QQ. For the correlation analysis, the previous classification algorithms cannot consider the mutual interactions between multiple (>2) classes of features. We then propose a novel Coupled Semi-Supervised Mutual Reinforcement-based Label Propagation (CSMRLP) algorithm for this purpose. Our extensive experiments show that CSMRLP outperforms the Mutual Reinforcement-based Label Propagation (MRLP) and five other traditional classification algorithms in the accuracy of AQ classification, and the effectiveness of our proposed method in AQ prediction.

However, the word ambiguity and word mismatch problems bring about new challenges for question retrieval in CQA. State-of-the-art approaches address these issues by implicitly expanding the queried questions with additional words or phrases using monolingual translation models. While useful, the effectiveness of these models is highly dependent on the availability of quality parallel monolingual corpora (e.g., question-answer pairs) in the absence of which they are troubled by noise issues. In this work, we propose an alternative way to address the word ambiguity and word mismatch problems by taking advantage of potentially rich semantic information drawn from other languages. Our proposed method employs statistical machine translation to improve question retrieval and enriches the question representation with the translated words from other languages via non-negative matrix factorization.

To address this problem, question routing has been proposed which aims at routing new questions to suitable answerers, who have both high possibility and high ability to answer the questions. In this paper, we formulate question routing as a multi-objective ranking problem, and present a multi-objective learning-to-rank approach for question routing (MLQR), which can simultaneously optimize the answering possibility and answer quality of routed users. In MLQR, realizing that questions are relatively short and usually attached with tags, we first propose a tagword topic model (TTM) to derive topical representations of questions. Based on TTM, we then develop features for each question-user pair, which are captured at both platform level and thread level. In particular, the platform-level features summarize the information of a user from his/her history posts in the CQA platform, while the thread-level features model the pairwise competitions of a user with others in his/her answered threads. Finally, we extend a state-of-the-art learning-to-rank algorithm for training a multi-objective ranking model. Extensive experimental results on real-world datasets show that our MLQR can outperform state-of-the-art methods in terms of both answering possibility and answer quality.","1558-2191","","10.1109/TKDE.2017.2696008","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61502047); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7904676","Community question answering services;question routing;multiple-objective optimization","Routing;Training;Feature extraction;Knowledge discovery;Optimization;History;Training data","","21","","34","IEEE","19 Apr 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Currently, a variety of expert recommendation methods have been proposed and greatly improved the effective matching between questions and potential good answerers. However, the performance of existing methods can be adversely affected by many common factors such as data sparsity and noise problem, which cause less precise user modeling. Moreover, existing methods often model user-question interactions through simple ways, failing to capture the multiple scale interactions of question and answerers, which make it difficult to find answerers who are able to provide the best answers. In this paper, we propose an attention-based variant of Factorization Machines (FM) called Hierarchical Attentional Factorization Machines (HaFMRank) for answerer recommendation in CQA, which not only models the interactions between pairs of individual features but emphasizes the roles of crucial features and pairwise interactions. Specifically, we introduce the within-field attention layer to capture the inner structure of features belonging to the same field, while a feature-interaction attention layer is adopted to examine the importance of each pairwise interaction. A pre-training procedure is designed to generate latent FM feature embedding that encode question context and user history into the training process of HaFMRank. The performance of the proposed HaFMRank is evaluated by using real-world datasets of Stack Exchange and experimental results demonstrate that it outperforms several state-of-the-art methods in best answerer recommendation.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2974893","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61932007,61902075); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9001106","Community question answering;attention mechanism;factorization machines;expert recommendation","Frequency modulation;Knowledge discovery;Task analysis;History;Training;Routing;Semantics","","9","","47","CCBY","18 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

One of them is progressing towards gender parity across topics as a means of keeping communities vibrant. More specifically, this demographic variable has shown to play a crucial role in devising better user engagement strategies. For instance, by kindling the interest of their members for topics dominated by the opposite gender. However, in most cQA websites, the gender field is neither mandatory nor verified when submitting and processing enrollment forms. And as might be expected, it is left blank most of the time, forcing cQA services to infer this demographic information from the activity of their users on their platforms such as prompted questions, answers, self-descriptions and profile images. There is only a handful of studies dissecting automatic gender recognition across cQA fellows, and as far as we know, this work is the first effort to delve into the contribution of their profile pictures to this task. Since these images are an unconstrained environment, their multifariousness poses a particularly difficult and interesting challenge. With this mind, we assessed the performance of three state-of-art image processing techniques, namely pre-trained neural network models. In a nutshell, our best configuration finished with an accuracy of 81.68% (Inception-ResNet-50), and its corresponding Grad-Cam maps unveil that one of its principal focus of attention is determining silhouettes edges.

One way of increasing the contribution of their members is by connecting their content with the right target audience. To achieve this goal, demographic analysis is pivotal in deciphering the interest of each community fellow. Indeed, demographic factors such as gender are fundamental in reducing the gender disparity across distinct topics. This work assesses the classification rate of assorted state-of-the-art transformer-based models (e.g., BERT and FNET) on the task of gender identification across cQA fellows. For this purpose, it benefited from a massive text-oriented corpus encompassing 548,375 member profiles including their respective full-questions, answers and self-descriptions. This assisted in conducting large-scale experiments considering distinct combinations of encoders and sources. Contrary to our initial intuition, in average terms, self-descriptions were detrimental due to their sparseness. In effect, the best transformer models achieved an AUC of 0.92 by taking full-questions and answers into account (i.e., DeBERTa and MobileBERT). Our qualitative results reveal that fine-tuning on user-generated content is affected by pre-training on clean corpora, and that this adverse effect can be mitigated by correcting the case of words.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3235735","Project Fondecyt “Multimodal Demographics and Psychographics for Improving Engagement in Question Answering Communities” by the Chilean Government(grant numbers:1220367); Patagón Supercomputer of the Universidad Austral de Chile(grant numbers:FONDEQUIP EQM180042); Center for Bioinformatics and Integrative Biology (CBIB), hosted at the Faculty of Biological Sciences, University Andrés Bello, Santiago, Chile; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10013653","Gender identification;community question-answering sites;engagement and participation in online communities;transformers","Transformers;Gender issues;Computer architecture;Bit error rate;Semantics;Question answering (information retrieval);Question answering (information retrieval)","","6","","60","CCBY","10 Jan 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Meanwhile, the emphasis of Q&A can be automatically distinguished. Furthermore, we design a time-sensitive ranking function to model the timeliness in CQA.

Collecting additional information to better characterize reducible uncertainties is among decision alternatives. Value of information (VoI) analysis is a mathematical decision framework that quantifies expected potential benefits of new data and assists with optimal allocation of resources for information collection. However, analysis of VoI is computational very costly because of the underlying Bayesian inference especially for equality-type information. This paper proposes the first surrogate-based framework for VoI analysis. Instead of modeling the limit state functions describing events of interest for decision making, which is commonly pursued in surrogate model-based reliability methods, the proposed framework models system responses. This approach affords sharing equality-type information from observations among surrogate models to update likelihoods of multiple events of interest. Moreover, two knowledge sharing schemes called model and training points sharing are proposed to most effectively take advantage of the knowledge offered by costly model evaluations. Both schemes are integrated with an error rate-based adaptive training approach to efficiently generate accurate Kriging surrogate models. The proposed VoI analysis framework is applied for an optimal decision-making problem involving load testing of a truss bridge. While state-of-the-art methods based on importance sampling and adaptive Kriging Monte Carlo simulation are unable to solve this problem, the proposed method is shown to offer accurate and robust estimates of VoI with a limited number of model evaluations. Therefore, the proposed method facilitates the application of VoI for complex decision problems.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2980228","National Science Foundation(grant numbers:CMMI-1635569,1762918); Lichtenstein endowment; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9032185","Adaptive Kriging;monitoring;reliability updating;surrogate model;value of information;VoI analysis","Computational modeling;Reliability;Uncertainty;Adaptation models;Decision making;Analytical models;Monte Carlo methods","","18","","44","CCBY","11 Mar 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In response, recent literature has seen a proliferation of efforts aimed at reducing the annotation burden. This paper focuses on a weakly-supervised training setting for single-cell segmentation models, where the only available training label is the rough locations of individual cells. The specific problem is of practical interest due to the widely available nuclei counter-stain data in biomedical literature, from which the cell locations can be derived programmatically. Of more general interest is a proposed self-learning method called collaborative knowledge sharing, which is related to but distinct from the more well-known consistency learning methods. This strategy achieves self-learning by sharing knowledge between a principal model and a very light-weight collaborator model. Importantly, the two models are entirely different in their architectures, capacities, and model outputs: In our case, the principal model approaches the segmentation problem from an object-detection perspective, whereas the collaborator model a sematic segmentation perspective. We assessed the effectiveness of this strategy by conducting experiments on LIVECell, a large single-cell segmentation dataset of bright-field images, and on A431 dataset, a fluorescence image dataset in which the location labels are generated automatically from nuclei counter-stain data.

The power of crowd computing stems from a large number of workers potentially available to provide high quality of service and reduce costs. An important challenge in the crowdsourcing market today is the task allocation of crowdsourcing workflows. Task allocation aims to maximize the completion quality of the entire workflow and minimize its total cost. Trust can affect the quality of the produced results and costs. Selecting workers with high levels of trust could provide better solution to the workflow and increase the budget. Crowdsourcing workflow needs to balance the two conflicting objectives. In this paper, we propose an alternative greedy approach with four heuristic strategies to address the issue. In particular, the proposed approach aims to monitor the current status of workflow execution and use heuristic strategies to adjust the parameters of task allocation. We design a two-phase allocation model to accurately match the tasks with workers. T-Aware allocates each task to the worker that maximizes the trust level, while minimizing the cost. We conduct extensive experiments to quantitatively evaluate the proposed algorithms in terms of running time, task failure ratio, trust and cost using a customer objective function on WorkflowSim, a well-known cloud simulation tool. Experimental results based on real-world workflows show that T-Aware outperforms other optimal solutions on finding the tradeoff between trust and cost, which is 3 to 6% better than the best competitor algorithm.","1460-2067","","10.1093/comjnl/bxaa202","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9514732","crowdsourcing workflow;task allocation;trust;scientific workflow","","","1","","","","16 Aug 2021","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Team crowdsourcing in social networks (SNs) provides a promising solution for complex task crowdsourcing, where the requester hires a team of professional workers that are also socially connected can work together collaboratively. Previous social team formation approaches have mainly focused on the algorithmic aspect for social welfare maximization; however, within the traditional objective of maximizing social welfare alone, selfish workers can manipulate the crowdsourcing market by behaving untruthfully. This dishonest behavior discourages other workers from participating and is unprofitable for the requester. To address this strategic social team crowdsourcing problem, truthful mechanisms are developed to guarantee that a worker's utility is optimized when he behaves honestly. This problem is proved to NP-hard, and two efficient mechanisms are proposed to optimize social welfare while reducing time complexity for different scale applications. For small-scale applications where the task requires a small number of skills, a binary tree network is first extracted from the social network, and a dynamic programming-based optimal team is formed in the binary tree. For large-scale applications where the task requires a large number of skills, a team is formed greedily based on the workers' social structure, skill, and working cost. For both mechanisms, the threshold payment rule, which pays each worker his marginal value for task completion, is proposed to elicit truthfulness. Finally, the experimental results of a real-world dataset show that compared to the benchmark exponential VCG truthful mechanism, the proposed small-scale-oriented mechanism can reduce computation time while producing nearly the same social welfare results. Furthermore, compared to other state-of-the-art polynomial heuristics, the proposed large-scale-oriented mechanism can achieve truthfulness while generating better social welfare outcomes.","1558-0660","","10.1109/TMC.2018.2860978","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61472079,61170164,61807008,61806053,61472089); Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province(grant numbers:BK20171363); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:U1501254); Science and Technology Planning Project of Guangdong Province(grant numbers:2015B010131015,2015B010108006); Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province(grant numbers:2014A030308008); Guangdong Regular University International and Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan Cooperative Innovation Platform and International Cooperation(grant numbers:2015KGJHZ023); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8423113","Mechanism design;crowdsourcing;team formation;social networks","Crowdsourcing;Task analysis;Social networking (online);Collaboration;Computer science;Time complexity;Binary trees","","40","","50","IEEE","30 Jul 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

How to accurately match relevant answers for a given question is an essential function in CQA tasks. Recent effective methods utilize word-pair interactions between questions and answers for CQA matching. However, these approaches usually encode questions and answers independently and ignore the fact that they can complement and enhance each other to provide better representations and thus more implicit interactions can be captured. In addition, the visual information, social information and the variable-length problem are usually ignored by most existing approaches. In this paper, a Social-aware Multi-modal Co-attention Convolutional Matching method (SMCACM) is proposed, which models the multi-modal content and social context of questions and answers in a unified framework for CQA matching. A novel co-attention network is proposed to extract complementary information from questions and answers to enhance each other for obtaining better representations, through which our model can capture more implicit interactions between questions and answers. In addition to textual content, our model uses object detection techniques and a meta-path based heterogeneous social representation learning approach to take advantage of the visual content and social context in CQA systems, respectively. Finally, a pooling-based convolutional matching network is designed to infer the matching score based on the complemented questions and answers, which can accept variable-length answers as inputs without padding or cutting. Experimental results on two real-world datasets demonstrate the superior performance of SMCACM compared with other state-of-the-art algorithms.","1941-0077","","10.1109/TMM.2020.3009491","National Key Research and Development Program of China Stem Cell and Translational Research(grant numbers:2017YFB1002804); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61720106006,61572503,61802405,61872424,61702509,61832002,61936005,U1705262); Key Research Program of Frontier Sciences(grant numbers:QYZDJ-SSW-JSC039); K.

With the goal of helping to improve the information diffusion between Stack Overflow and other documentation resources, we conducted a study to answer the question of how and why documentation is referenced in Stack Overflow threads. We sampled and classified 759 links from two different domains, regular expressions and Android development, to qualitatively and quantitatively analyze the links’ context and purpose, including attribution, awareness, and recommendations. We found that links on Stack Overflow serve a wide range of distinct purposes, ranging from citation links attributing content copied into Stack Overflow, over links clarifying concepts using Wikipedia pages, to recommendations of software components and resources for background reading. This purpose spectrum has major corollaries, including our observation that links to documentation resources are a reflection of the information needs typical to a technology domain. We contribute a framework and method to analyze the context and purpose of Stack Overflow links, a public dataset of annotated links, and a description of five major observations about linking practices on Stack Overflow. Those observations include the above-mentioned purpose spectrum, its interplay with documentation resources and applications domains, and the fact that links on Stack Overflow often lack context in form of accompanying quotes or summaries.

The choice of answer they select can mean the difference between a secure application and insecure one, as the quality of supposedly secure answers can vary. Prior work has studied people posting on Stack Overflow—a two-way communication between the original poster and the Stack Overflow community. Instead, we study the situation of one-way communication, where people only read a Stack Overflow thread without being actively involved in it, sometimes long after a thread has closed. We report on a mixed-method study including a controlled between-groups experiment and qualitative analysis of participants’ rationale (N=1188), investigating whether explanation detail, answer scoring, accepted answer marks, as well as the security of the code snippet itself affect the answers participants accept. Our findings indicate that explanation detail affects what answers participants reading a thread select (p<0.01), while answer score and acceptance do not (p>0.05)—the inverse of what research has shown for those asking and answering questions. The qualitative analysis of participants’ rationale further explains how several cognitive biases underpin these findings. Correspondence bias, in particular, plays an important role in instilling readers with a false sense of confidence in an answer through the way it looks, regardless of whether it works, is secure, or if the community agrees with it. As a result, we argue that StackOverflow's use as a knowledge base by people not actively involved in threads—when there is only one-way-communication—may inadvertently contribute to the spread of insecure code, as the community's voting mechanisms hold little power to deter them from answers.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2020.2981317","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(grant numbers:EP/P011799/1); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9072521","Software security;stack overflow;human factors;rationale","Security;Semantics;Software;Documentation;Knowledge based systems;Message systems;Licenses","","10","","52","CCBY","20 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We propose a unified framework for cross-domain CF over the site-time coordinate system by sharing group-level rating patterns and imposing user/item dependence across domains. A generative model, say ratings over site-time (ROST), which can generate and predict ratings for multiple related CF domains, is developed as the basic model for the framework. We further introduce cross-domain user/item dependence into ROST and extend it to two real-world cross-domain CF scenarios: 1) ROST (sites) for alleviating rating sparsity in the target domain, where multiple similar sites are viewed as related CF domains and some items in the target domain depend on their correspondences in the related ones; and 2) ROST (time) for modeling user-interest drift over time, where a series of time-slices are viewed as related CF domains and a user at current time-slice depends on herself in the previous time-slice. All these ROST models are instances of the proposed unified framework.

To achieve this, off-the-shelf mobile devices are usually equipped with dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS)-enabled processors to tradeoff performance for energy reduction through online adjustment of operating points. Recently, reinforcement learning algorithms have been widely studied and show great potential for runtime DVFS control because of their adaptability to the changing environment. However, the rapid evolution of hardware and the ever-growing diversity of mobile applications increase the system complexity dramatically and make it hard for the learning agent to quickly obtain an efficient power management policy. To address this challenge, we propose a decentralized collaborative Q-learning (DCQL)-based approach in this article to solve the DVFS control problem of multicore mobile processors. By exchanging learning experiences and knowledge among multiple devices, DCQL increases the convergence rate of the learning algorithm and improves the quality of the derived power management policy. On each device, the 4-phase action selection strategy is applied for efficient exploration of the action space defined by various power settings. Experimental results on realistic applications show that DCQL can achieve 3.4%-8.0% energy reduction over various existing approaches while providing an average of 3.4× speedup over the state-of-the-art individual learning algorithm. We also show that the proposed approach can scale well with the number of cores through clustered DVFS control.","1557-9999","","10.1109/TVLSI.2020.2970762","GRF16211418; IRS19EG52; FSGRF15EG04; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9001266","Collaborative learning;energy minimization;knowledge sharing;multicore system;reinforcement learning (RL);voltage and frequency scaling","Multicore processing;Program processors;Power system management;Energy consumption;Performance evaluation;Mobile handsets;Convergence","","1","","34","IEEE","18 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We present a study of online code clones on Stack Overflow and their toxicity by incorporating two developer surveys and a large-scale code clone detection.

A survey of 87 Stack Overflow visitors shows that they experienced several issues from Stack Overflow answers: mismatched solutions, outdated solutions, incorrect solutions, and buggy code. 85 percent of them are not aware of CC BY-SA 3.0 license enforced by Stack Overflow, and 66 percent never check for license conflicts when reusing code snippets.

Although researchers have investigated how to enrich API documentation with code samples from general code search engines, two main challenges remain to be resolved, including the quality challenge of acquiring high-quality code samples and the mapping challenge of matching code samples to usage scenarios. In this study, we propose a novel approach named ADECK towards enriching API documentation with code samples and corresponding usage scenarios by leveraging crowd knowledge from Stack Overflow, a popular technical Question and Answer (Q&A) website attracting millions of developers. Given an API related Q&A pair, a code sample in the answer is extensively evaluated by developers and targeted towards resolving the question under the specified usage scenario. Hence, ADECK can obtain high-quality code samples and map them to corresponding usage scenarios to address the above challenges. Extensive experiments on the Java SE and Android API documentation show that the number of code-sample-illustrated API types in the ADECK-enriched API documentation is 3.35 and 5.76 times as many as that in the raw API documentation. Meanwhile, the quality of code samples obtained by ADECK is better than that of code samples by the baseline approach eXoaDocs in terms of correctness, conciseness, and usability, e.g., the average correctness values of representative code samples obtained by ADECK and eXoaDocs are 4.26 and 3.28 on a 5-point scale in the enriched Java SE API documentation. In addition, an empirical study investigating the impacts of different types of API documentation on the productivity of developers shows that, compared against the raw and the eXoaDocs-enriched API documentation, the ADECK-enriched API documentation can help developers complete 23.81 and 14.29 percent more programming tasks and reduce the average completion time by 9.43 and 11.03 percent.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2019.2919304","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2018YFB1003900); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61722202,61602258); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(grant numbers:2017M621247); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8723145","API documentation;code sample;usage scenario;stack overflow;crowd knowledge","Documentation;Programming;Java;Knowledge engineering;Search engines;Productivity;Task analysis","","15","","62","IEEE","27 May 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this crowdsourced question answering process, Stack Overflow becomes a code hosting website where developers actively share its code. However, code snippets on Stack Overflow may contain security vulnerabilities, and if shared carelessly, such snippets can introduce security problems in software systems. In this paper, we empirically study the prevalence of the Common Weakness Enumeration – CWE, in code snippets of C/C++ related answers. We explore the characteristics of $Code_w$Codew, i.e., code snippets that have CWE instances, in terms of the types of weaknesses, the evolution of $Code_w$Codew, and who contributed such code snippets. We find that: 1) 36 percent (i.e., 32 out of 89) CWE types are detected in $Code_w$Codew on Stack Overflow. Particularly, CWE-119, i.e., improper restriction of operations within the bounds of a memory buffer, is common in both answer code snippets and real-world software systems. Furthermore, the proportion of $Code_w$Codew doubled from 2008 to 2018 after normalizing by the total number of C/C++ snippets in each year. 2) In general, code revisions are associated with a reduction in the number of code weaknesses. However, the majority of $Code_w$Codew had weaknesses introduced in the first version of the code, and these $Code_w$Codew were never revised since then. Only 7.5 percent of users who contributed C/C++ code snippets posted or edited code with weaknesses. Users contributed less code with CWE weakness when they were more active (i.e., they either revised more code snippets or had a higher reputation). We also find that some users tended to have the same CWE type repeatedly in their various code snippets. Our empirical study provides insights to users who share code snippets on Stack Overflow so that they are aware of the potential security issues. To understand the community feedback about improving code weaknesses by answer revisions, we also conduct a qualitative study and find that 62.5 percent of our suggested revisions are adopted by the community. Stack Overflow can perform CWE scanning for all the code that is hosted on its platform. Further research is needed to improve the quality of the crowdsourced knowledge on Stack Overflow.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2021.3058985","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9359361","Code security;C/C++;empirical software engineering;crowdsourced knowledge sharing and management;stack overflow","Security;Programming;Software systems;History;Electronic mail;C++ languages;Indexes","","19","","50","IEEE","19 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The links that reference to the resources hosted outside the Stack Overflow websites extend the Stack Overflow knowledge base substantially. However, with the rapid development of programming-related knowledge, many resources hosted on the Internet are not available anymore. Based on our analysis of the Stack Overflow data that was released on Jun. 2, 2019, 14.2 percent of the links on Stack Overflow are broken links. The broken links on Stack Overflow can obstruct viewers from obtaining desired programming-related knowledge, and potentially damage the reputation of the Stack Overflow as viewers might regard the posts with broken links as obsolete. In this paper, we characterize the broken links on Stack Overflow. 65 percent of the broken links in our sampled questions are used to show examples, e.g., code examples. 70 percent of the broken links in our sampled answers are used to provide supporting information, e.g., explaining a certain concept and describing a step to solve a problem. Only 1.67 percent of the posts with broken links are highlighted as such by viewers in the posts’ comments. Only 5.8 percent of the posts with broken links removed the broken links. Viewers cannot fully rely on the vote scores to detect broken links, as broken links are common across posts with different vote scores. The websites that host resources that can be maintained by their users are referenced by broken links the most on Stack Overflow – a prominent example of such websites is GitHub. The posts and comments related to the web technologies, i.e., JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and jQuery, are associated with more broken links.

Understanding developers’ motivations in the presence of gamification and the relationship between their motivations and behavioral outcomes is crucial for community building and designing good incentive mechanisms. Grounded on self-determination theory, we conducted a survey with 938 developers who participate in SO to understand their participation motivations and incentive perceptions. By connecting the survey responses with the SO data, we quantitatively analyzed how the developers’ motivations and satisfaction of needs relate to their effort and contribution quality. Our main findings are as follows: (1) despite the presence of gamified incentive mechanisms, developers are mainly motivated by intrinsic motivation to participate in SO; (2) developers who have strong motivations to gain gamification rewards are associated with higher intrinsic and integrated motivations, while developers with more development experiences are less motivated by the gamified incentives; (3) both extrinsic motivations (in terms of career prospects) and intrinsic motivations (regarding self-improvement and helping others) can motivate developers to make high-quantity and high-quality contributions; and (4) high-level satisfaction of needs for competency and autonomy has a positive effect on developers making high-quantity and high-quality contributions and addressing difficult problems.

Answers posted on Stack Overflow help developers solve issues during software development. In addition to posting answers, users can also post comments to further discuss their associated answers. As of Aug 2017, there are 32.3 million comments that are associated with answers, forming a large collection of crowdsourced repository of knowledge on top of the commonly-studied Stack Overflow answers. In this study, we wish to understand how the commenting activities contribute to the crowdsourced knowledge. We investigate what users discuss in comments, and analyze the characteristics of the commenting dynamics, (i.e., the timing of commenting activities and the roles of commenters). We find that: 1) the majority of comments are informative and thus can enhance their associated answers from a diverse range of perspectives. However, some comments contain content that is discouraged by Stack Overflow. 2) The majority of commenting activities occur after the acceptance of an answer. More than half of the comments are fast responses occurring within one day of the creation of an answer, while later comments tend to be more informative. Most comments are rarely integrated back into their associated answers, even though such comments are informative. 3) Insiders (i.e., users who posted questions/answers before posting a comment in a question thread) post the majority of comments within one month, and outsiders (i.e., users who never posted any question/answer before posting a comment) post the majority of comments after one month. Inexperienced users tend to raise limitations and concerns while experienced users tend to enhance the answer through commenting. Our study provides insights into the commenting activities in terms of their content, timing, and the individuals who perform the commenting. For the purpose of long-term knowledge maintenance and effective information retrieval for developers, we also provide actionable suggestions to encourage Stack Overflow users/engineers/moderators to leverage our insights for enhancing the current Stack Overflow commenting system for improving the maintenance and organization of the crowdsourced knowledge.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2019.2954319","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8906075","Crowdsourced knowledge sharing and management;stack overflow;commenting;empirical software engineering","Programming;Software;Guidelines;Maintenance engineering;Knowledge discovery;Timing","","23","","39","IEEE","19 Nov 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, duplicate questions frequently appear in Stack Overflow and they are manually marked by the users with high reputation. Automatic duplicate question detection alleviates labor and effort for users with high reputation. Although existing approaches extract textual features to automatically detect duplicate questions, these approaches are limited since semantic information could be lost. To tackle this problem, we explore the use of powerful deep learning techniques, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), to detect duplicate questions in Stack Overflow. In addition, we use Word2Vec to obtain the vector representations of words. They can fully capture semantic information at document-level and word-level respectively. Therefore, we construct three deep learning approaches WV-CNN, WV-RNN and WV-LSTM, which are based on Word2Vec, CNN, RNN and LSTM, to detect duplicate questions in Stack Overflow. Evaluation results show that WV-CNN and WV-LSTM have made significant improvements over four baseline approaches (i.e., DupPredictor, Dupe, DupPredictorRep-T, and DupeRep) and three deep learning approaches (i.e., DQ-CNN, DQ-RNN, and DQ-LSTM) in terms of recall-rate@5, recall-rate@10 and recall-rate@20. Furthermore, the experimental results indicate that our approaches WV-CNN, WV-RNN, and WV-LSTM outperform four machine learning approaches based on Support Vector Machine, Logic Regression, Random Forest and eXtreme Gradient Boosting in terms of recall-rate@5, recall-rate@10 and recall-rate@20.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2968391","National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program)(grant numbers:2018AAA0102304); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61672078); State Key Laboratory of Software Development Environment(grant numbers:SKLSDE-2019ZX-05); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8964380","Stack overflow;duplicate question detection;deep learning","Deep learning;Task analysis;Semantics;Software;Software engineering;Computer architecture","","33","","38","CCBY","22 Jan 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A common step performed by those solutions is to extract suitable representations of posts; typically, in the form of meaningful vectors. These vectors are then used for different tasks, for example, tag recommendation, relatedness prediction, post classification, and API recommendation. Intuitively, the quality of the vector representations of posts determines the effectiveness of the solutions in performing the respective tasks. In this work, to aid existing studies that analyze Stack Overflow posts, we propose a specialized deep learning architecture Post2Vec which extracts distributed representations of Stack Overflow posts. Post2Vec is aware of different types of content present in Stack Overflow posts, i.e., title, description, and code snippets, and integrates them seamlessly to learn post representations. Tags provided by Stack Overflow users that serve as a common vocabulary that captures the semantics of posts are used to guide Post2Vec in its task. To evaluate the quality of Post2Vec's deep learning architecture, we first investigate its end-to-end effectiveness in tag recommendation task. The results are compared to those of state-of-the-art tag recommendation approaches that also employ deep neural networks. We observe that Post2Vec achieves 15-25 percent improvement in terms of F1-score@5 at a lower computational cost. Moreover, to evaluate the value of representations learned by Post2Vec, we use them for three other tasks, i.e., relatedness prediction, post classification, and API recommendation. We demonstrate that the representations can be used to boost the effectiveness of state-of-the-art solutions for the three tasks by substantial margins (by 10, 7, and 10 percent in terms of F1-score, F1-score, and correctness, respectively).

To solve these problems, we propose a Spatiotemporal Prediction based Spatial Crowdsourcing strategy, named SPSC, using both blockchain and artificial intelligence. Specifically, considering the temporal and spatial continuity of crowdsourced task data, SPSC combines both gated recurrent unit and variational autoencoder for crowdsourcing task prediction. In addition, different Laplacian noises are added to crowdsourced task data so as to protect the privacy of crowdsourced workers during the task prediction. Moreover, by classifying crowdsourcing tasks and grouping crowdsourcing workers, SPSC reduces the risk of crowdsourcing workers colluding to steal the privacy data of crowdsourcing tasks using the blockchain technology. The experimental results show that SPSC can improve the privacy protection of spatial crowdsourcing, specifically, the more the number of categories, the higher the degree of privacy protection, and under the premise of predicting value, excellent system performance can be achieved.","2327-4697","","10.1109/TNSE.2022.3198675","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:U1905211,61702103); Natural Science Foundation of Fujian Province(grant numbers:2020J01167,2020J01169); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9857623","Spatial crowdsourcing;task allocation;privacy protection;blockchain;machine learning","Task analysis;Crowdsourcing;Resource management;Privacy;Ions;Blockchains;Spatiotemporal phenomena","","2","","32","IEEE","16 Aug 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The framework gathers audio data from many people and shares user-generated models through a cloud server to accurately classify unseen audio data. A Gaussian histogram is used to represent an audio clip with a small number of parameters, and a k-nearest classifier allows the easy incorporation of new training data into the system. Using the Kullback-Leibler divergence between two Gaussian histograms as the distance measure, we find that audio scenes, events, and phone context are classified with 85.2%, 77.6%, and 88.9% accuracy, respectively.","1558-4127","","10.1109/TCE.2012.6227479","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6227479","environment recognition;sound recognition;acoustic scene analysis;crowdsourcing","Accuracy;Context;Histograms;Servers;Training;Noise measurement;Training data","","28","1","6","IEEE","5 Jul 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The idea of spatial crowdsourcing is recruiting a set of available crowds to finish the spatial tasks located in crowdsourcing locations, e.g., landmarks, by using their handheld devices. This paper addresses the worker recruitment problem in spatial crowdsourcing under the coverage and workload-balancing requirements. The coverage constraint means that any crowdsourcing location should be visited by at least one of the recruited workers to satisfy the Quality-of-Service requirement, e.g., traffic monitoring or climate forecast. In addition, we argue that each crowdsourcing operation has a cost in reality, e.g., data traffic or energy consumption and the resource may be limited at each crowdsourcing location. The objective of this paper is to solve a Coverage and Balanced Crowdsourcing Recruiting (CBCR) problem, which ensures the coverage requirement and minimizes the maximum crowdsourcing cost for any crowdsourcing location. We prove that the CBCR problem is NP-hard in the general case. Then, we discuss the CBCR problem in the 1-D scenario. In the 1-D scenario, we first propose a directionally coverage scheme and further extend it to a Polynomial-Time Approximation Scheme (PTAS) to trade-off the computation complexity and the performance. The performance can be bounded to 2 + ε, where ε can be an arbitrary small value. Then, we found that there exists a sub-optimal structure, and thus the dynamic programming approach is proposed to find the optimal solution in the 1-D scenario. In the general 2-D scenario, we first prove that it has a sub-modular property and thus the naive greedy algorithm has an approximation ratio of ln n + 1. In addition, we propose a randomized rounding algorithm with an expectation bound of O(logn / log logn).

This study uses a scientometric analysis of 7059 publications over the period 2006–2019 to map crowdsourcing research to identify clusters and applications. Our results are the first in the literature to map crowdsourcing research holistically. In this article, we classify its usage in the three domains of innovation, engineering, and science, where 11 categories and 26 subcategories are further developed. The results of this article reveal that the most active scientific clusters where crowdsourcing is used are environmental sciences and ecology. For the engineering domain, it is computer science, telecommunication, and operations research. In innovation, idea crowdsourcing, crowdfunding, and crowd creation are the most frequent areas.

As a variation of skyline query, skyline-join query can return the results from multiple datasets. However, incomplete datasets are a frequent phenomenon due to the widespread use of automated information extraction and aggregation. Existing methods for dealing with incomplete data, such as probability, data padding can solve the problem, but cannot effectively reflect the real situation and are lack of integrality. Therefore, in this paper, in order to reflect the situation more accuracy and more user-centric, we research the problem of skyline-join query over incomplete datasets with crowdsourcing, named CrowdSJ. The crowdsourcing-based skyline-join query processing problem over incomplete datasets is divided into two situations. One is the skyline-join query only involves the unknown crowdsourcing attribute and the join attribute, named Partial Skyline-Join with Crowdsourcing (PSJCrowd). The other one is the skyline-join query involves all the attributes, named All Skyline-Join with Crowdsourcing (ASJCrowd). For PSJCrowd, first, we filter the known dataset. Then, we present the level-preference-tree-index, and propose the partial skyline-join with crowdsourcing algorithm. For ASJCrowd, first, we filter the known dataset too. Second, we build a level-preference-tree-index based on the known attributes of the incomplete dataset. Third, we propose the skyline-join with crowdsourcing on single dataset algorithm, CrowdSJ-single, to filter the dataset containing unknown attributes. Then, we build a global level-preference-tree-index based on the known attributes of the incomplete dataset and the complete dataset. We propose the skyline-join with crowdsourcing on multiple datasets algorithm, CrowdSJ-multiple. We filter the linked tuples based on the global level-preference-tree-index and the results of each round of crowdsourcing.

This paper proposes an incentive mechanism to maximize social welfare for mobile crowdsourcing and, respectively, investigates worker-centric task selection and platform-centric worker selection. This paper applies an optimization algorithm in task selection for mobile crowdsourcing systems. A discrete particle swarm optimization (DPSO) algorithm for worker-centric task selection is designed to maximize the utilities of workers.

A large-scale crowdsourcing task often consists of thousands or millions of atomic tasks, each of which is usually a simple task such as binary choice or simple voting. To distribute a large-scale crowdsourcing task to limited crowd workers, a common practice is to pack a set of atomic tasks into a task bin and send to a crowd worker in a batch. It is challenging to decompose a large-scale crowdsourcing task and execute batches of atomic tasks, which ensures reliable answers at a minimal total cost. Large batches lead to unreliable answers of atomic tasks, while small batches incur unnecessary cost. In this paper, we investigate a general crowdsourcing task decomposition problem, called the Smart Large-scAle task DEcomposer (SLADE) problem, which aims to decompose a large-scale crowdsourcing task to achieve the desired reliability at a minimal cost. We prove the NP-hardness of the SLADE problem and propose solutions in both homogeneous and heterogeneous scenarios. For the homogeneous SLADE problem, where all the atomic tasks share the same reliability requirement, we propose a greedy heuristic algorithm and an efficient and effective approximation framework using an optimal priority queue (OPQ) structure with provable approximation ratio. For the heterogeneous SLADE problem, where the atomic tasks can have different reliability requirements, we extend the OPQ-based framework leveraging a partition strategy, and also prove its approximation guarantee. Finally, we verify the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed solutions through extensive experiments on representative crowdsourcing platforms.","1558-2191","","10.1109/TKDE.2018.2797962","National Grand Fundamental Research 973 Program of China(grant numbers:2015CB358700); NSFC(grant numbers:61502021,61532004); SKLSDE (BUAA) Open Program(grant numbers:SKLSDE-2016ZX-13); Hong Kong RGC Project(grant numbers:16202215); Science and Technology Planning Project of Guangdong Province, China(grant numbers:2015B010110006); NSFC(grant numbers:61729201,61232018); Microsoft Research Asia Collaborative Grant; Huawei Grant; NSFC Guang Dong Grant(grant numbers:U1301253); NSF(grant numbers:IIS-1250880); NSFC(grant numbers:61672455); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8268652","Crowdsourcing;task decomposition","Task analysis;Crowdsourcing;Approximation algorithms;Electronic mail;Computer science;Reliability engineering","","83","","40","IEEE","24 Jan 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Drawing from our empirical findings and the crowdsourcing literature, we propose a theoretical model of crowd interest and actual participation in crowdsourcing competitions.

In the logistics industry, crowdsourcing provides a new idea of sustainable development for logistics enterprises, and reasonable distribution pricing is the key to achieving sustainable development. This paper innovatively adds dynamic and decentralized characteristics of logistics on the basis of a detailed analysis of pricing methods and uses this as a basis to build a pricing model. First, based on existing crowdsourced photography task pricing data, this paper establishes a project-centric domain and builds metrics into the attributes of each project based on the data in that domain. Then, a regression model is used to fit the completion rate of previous projects, and a multiple linear regression and optimal pricing mechanism are established. Finally, the DBSCAN algorithm is used to cluster areas with a high project density, and a pricing optimization model based on polynomial Logit (MNL) is established. We found through the model analysis that the optimized pricing strategy of crowdsourcing logistics services has a better packaging completion rate based on a combination of complex factors including bundling and outliers.

Since the incentives among these three stakeholders always conflict with each other, to elevate the long-term development of the crowdsourcing community, we take the perspective of the whole crowdsourcing community, and design a crowdsourcing mechanism to align incentives of stakeholders together. Specifically, we give workers reward or penalty according to their reporting solutions instead of only nonnegative payment. Furthermore, we find a series of proper reward-penalty function pairs and compute workers personal order values, which can provide different amounts of reward and penalty according to both the workers reporting beliefs and their individual history performances, and keep the incentive of workers at the same time.

First, decomposing complex tasks into a set of micro-subtasks requires the decomposition capability of the requesters; thus, some requesters may abandon using crowdsourcing to accomplish a large number of complex tasks since they cannot bear such heavy burden by themselves. Second, tasks are often assigned redundantly to multiple workers to achieve reliable results, but reliability may not be ensured when there are many malicious workers in the crowd. Currently, it is observed that the workers are often connected through social networks, a feature that can significantly facilitate task allocation and task execution in crowdsourcing. Therefore, this paper investigates crowdsourcing in social networks and presents a novel context-aware reliable crowdsourcing approach. In our presented approach, the two problems in traditional crowdsourcing are addressed as follows: 1) the complex tasks can be performed through autonomous coordination between the assigned worker and his contextual workers in the social network; thus, the requesters can be exempt from a heavy computing load for decomposing complex tasks into subtasks and combing the partial results of subtasks, thereby enabling more requesters to accomplish a large number of complex tasks through crowdsourcing, and 2) the reliability of a worker is determined not only by the reputation of the worker himself but also by the reputations of the contextual workers in the social network; thus, the unreliability of transient or malicious workers can be effectively addressed. The presented approach addresses two types of social networks including simplex and multiplex networks. Based on theoretical analyses and experiments on a real-world dataset, we find that the presented approach can achieve significantly higher task allocation and execution efficiency than the previous benchmark task allocation approaches; moreover, the presented contextual reputation mechanism can achieve relatively higher reliability when there are many malicious workers in the crowd.","2168-2232","","10.1109/TSMC.2017.2777447","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61472079,61170164); Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province(grant numbers:BK20171363); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8226780","Context-aware;crowdsourcing;reliability;social networks;task allocation;task execution","Social network services;Crowdsourcing;Reliability;Resource management;Transient analysis;Computer network reliability","","25","","41","IEEE","19 Dec 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

First, traditional systems fail to protect the privacy of task requesters and workers. They typically rely on a centralized server to aggregate the task content and workers' interests, while these data contain sensitive information. Second, crowdsourcing resources in each system are isolated. The tasks in one system cannot reach potential workers in other systems. Thus, there is a great need to build a new privacy-preserving and federated crowdsourcing system. However, the existing privacy-preserving solutions rely on a trusted third party to perform key management, which is not applicable in a federated setting. To this end, we propose the first proxy-free privacy-preserving and federated crowdsourcing system. It interconnects the existing crowdsourcing systems and can perform encrypted task matching across various systems without relying on a trusted third-party authority. Our main idea is to achieve federated crowdsourcing by moving secure task matching to the trusted smart contract. To get rid of the dependence on the trusted authority, we combine the rewritable deterministic hashing technique with searchable encryption schemes to achieve secure on-chain task-matching authorization. Moreover, we utilize the puncturable encryption technique to implement secure authorization revocation. We formally analyze the security of our design and implement a prototype on Ethereum.

While crowdsourcing does not depend on any specific underlying network, the device-to-device (D2D)-based crowdsourcing is highly desired when the originator of a crowdsourcing task cannot directly reach out to the participants or the conventional approaches for data transportation are costly. The marriage of crowdsourcing and D2D creates new, interesting research problems, mainly due to the unique non-deterministic setting in D2D. In this work, we focus on the problem of how to efficiently distribute a crowdsourcing task and recruit participants based on D2D communications. We formally formulate the minimum-cost crowdsourcing (MCC) problem in D2D networks, which explores a multi-dimensional design space to seek an optimal solution that minimizes the total crowdsourcing cost while satisfying the coverage probability over the field of interest. We introduce an approximation algorithm based on a reduced solution space and formally prove that its cost is bounded by a desired approximation ratio in comparison with the optimal solution. We further propose a lightweight online heuristic that inherits the same design philosophy but implements it in a distributed manner. We prototype the proposed online scheme in Android and carry out experiments in a campus environment, involving 21 Dell Streak tablets carried by students for a period of 15 days. We also extract the algorithm codes from our prototype and perform extensive simulations based on Haggle trace.

However, when users collect fingerprint information using crowdsourcing data in practical applications, the received signal strength (RSS) information collected by user phones updates slowly and will remain the same for a certain distance and time. Therefore, crowdsourcing data is inaccurate, and a radio map thereby established will also lead to inaccurate indoor positioning. In order to address this issue, this paper proposes a method for extracting effective RSS information from crowdsourcing data in order to establish the radio map and achieve positioning. By analyzing the crowdsourcing data characteristics, effective RSS information is identified and extracted. Based on inertial sensors data, the position of effective RSS information is determined. The effective crowdsourcing data associated with the position is weighted and fused in order to establish the radio map. Aimed at the issue of the RSS collected by phones updating slowly, a combined positioning method for position calculation is proposed in order to achieve effective positioning. Experiments were conducted in a real environment to validate the algorithm, and the positioning accuracy could reach 1.5 m by using crowdsourcing data to construct the radio map and executing an indoor positioning algorithm, which is close to the accuracy achieved when using manual data collected by professionals at a certain distance and saves a great deal of labor.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2951406","National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program)(grant numbers:2017YFF0204905); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61671039); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8890872","Fingerprint;received signal strength;indoor positioning;crowdsourcing","Crowdsourcing;Fingerprint recognition;Wireless fidelity;Data mining;Legged locomotion;Sensors;Feature extraction","","15","","27","CCBY","4 Nov 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, the mechanism of how various critical risk factors affect crowdsourcing performance has been poorly investigated. Empirical evidence based on a dataset of 169 samples from China shows that three technical (i.e., complexity, requirement, and task) and three social (i.e., seeker, solver, and relationship) subsystem risks not only directly but also interactively influence the crowdsourcing task performance. Technical subsystem risk factors, while worsen performance, diminish the negative effects of social subsystem risk factors on the crowdsourcing task performance. The diminishing effects of three technical subsystem risk factors are also differentiated. High requirement and task risks lessen the negative effects of seeker, solver, and relationship risks on the task performance, whereas the high complexity risk only weakens the negative effect of the solver risk. Therefore, various crowdsourcing risk factors affect the performance in different ways and directions (either negatively or positively). Risk can perform dual roles in influencing the performance. Hybrid strategies that integrate social and technical subsystem elements may be effective in achieving a superior task performance for the crowdsourcing risk management. Managers of crowdsourcing platforms can also optimize social and technical environments to improve the fit between social and technical systems.","1558-0040","","10.1109/TEM.2019.2902446","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:71471141,71722014,91646113,71771182,71731009); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8676221","Crowdsourcing marketplace;crowd participant;risk management;sociotechnical systems (STS) theory;task performance","Crowdsourcing;Task analysis;Outsourcing;Complexity theory;Risk management;Sociotechnical systems;Creativity","","14","","67","IEEE","29 Mar 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
"Investigating Software Standards: A Lens of Sustainability for Software Crowdsourcing","M. N. Malik; H. H. Khan","National University of Modern Languages, Islamabad, Pakistan; National University of Modern Languages, Islamabad, Pakistan",IEEE Access,"21 Feb 2018","2018","6","","5139","5150","Inevitably, the time has come that necessitates software systems to have long lasting social impact and environmental friendliness. Although sustainability related to environmental and social aspects have been well versed in the literature, software sustainability, for the way of development and as final product for use, is still not mature enough. With the increasing role of software crowdsourcing, a new working architecture for software development, in global software development (GSD) settings, has emerged challenges regarding sustainable software development and software sustainability, which are still to be elucidated. Software standards and models exist to assist co-located and global software development; however, seismic changes in the working architecture of software development as software crowdsourcing are highlighting a risk of software failure. Recently, statistics showed that only 30% of projects are successful, whereas 50% encounter challenges and the remaining 20% are absolute failures that implicate a challenge toward software success and its sustainability. This posits questions of how many IEEE and international standard organization standards exist that cover the sustainability aspects in particular to software development and how in-depth the development practices are addressing sustainable aspects in software crowdsourcing? Thus, the aim of this paper is to examine the IEEE software standards with a lens of sustainability to software crowdsourcing. After reviewing the existing IEEE standards related to sustainability, it has been observed that few standards exist which have discussed the importance of sustainability on an abstract level (energy and examining environmental influence by the computers) in software development. Moreover, standards are focusing less attention toward the sustainability of software development in the presence of new envision toward software crowdsourcing. Thus, a lack of any guideline toward sustainable software crowdsourcing is highlighted as one of the limitations in the software standards. This paper contributes to the GSD industry in two folds, first by laying down the importance and theoretical association on and around sustainable crowdsourcing, and second by highlighting that the IEEE standards, inadequacy toward the suppressing phenomena of sustainability in software crowdsourcing, if addressed adequately, can minimize the ripple effect toward software failure.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2791843","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8253457","Crowdsourcing;sustainability;software development","Software;Sustainable development;Crowdsourcing;Computer architecture;Software standards;Organizations","","12","","31","OAPA","10 Jan 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, we propose a wireless powered spatial crowdsourcing framework which consists of two mutually dependent phases: task allocation phase and data crowdsourcing phase. In the task allocation phase, we propose a Stackelberg game based mechanism for the spatial crowdsourcing platform to efficiently allocate spatial tasks and wireless charging power to each worker. In the data crowdsourcing phase, the workers may have an incentive to misreport its real working location to improve its utility, which causes adverse effects to the spatial crowdsourcing platform. To address this issue, we present three strategyproof deployment mechanisms for the spatial crowdsourcing platform to place a mobile base station, e.g., vehicle or robot, which is responsible for transferring the wireless power and collecting the crowdsourced data. As the benchmark, we first apply the classical median mechanism and evaluate its worst-case performance. Then, we design a conventional strategyproof deployment mechanism to improve the expected utility of the spatial crowdsourcing platform under the condition that the workers' locations follow a known geographical distribution. For a more general case with only the historical location data available, we propose a deep learning based strategyproof deployment mechanism to maximize the spatial crowdsourcing platform's utility. Extensive experimental results based on synthetic and real-world datasets reveal the effectiveness of the proposed framework in allocating tasks and charging power to workers while avoiding the dishonest worker's manipulation.","1939-9359","","10.1109/TVT.2019.2952926","National Research Foundation of Korea; Korean Government(grant numbers:2014R1A5A1011478); Singapore NRF National Satellite of Excellence, Design Science, and Technology for Secure Critical Infrastructure(grant numbers:DeST-SCI2019-0007); A*STAR-NTU-SUTD Joint Research Grant Call on Artificial Intelligence for the Future of Manufacturing(grant numbers:RGANS1906,M4082187 (4080)); Singapore MOE Tier 1(grant numbers:2017-T1-002-007 RG122/17); MOE Tier 2(grant numbers:MOE2014-T2-2-015 ARC4/15,NRF2015-NRF-ISF001-2277); Singapore EMA Energy Resilience(grant numbers:NRF2017EWT-EP003-041); Canada NSERC Discovery(grant numbers:RGPIN-2019-06375); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61971083,51939001); Dalian Science and Technology Innovation Fund(grant numbers:2019J11CY015); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8895988","Spatial crowdsourcing;deep learning;wireless power transfer;facility location;generalized median mechanism;automated mechanism design","Crowdsourcing;Task analysis;Wireless sensor networks;Wireless communication;Resource management;Sensors;Games","","12","","35","IEEE","11 Nov 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
