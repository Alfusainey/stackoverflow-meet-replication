"Incentive Mechanism and Rating System Design for Crowdsourcing Systems: Analysis, Tradeoffs and Inference","H. Xie; J. C. S.

It is widely practiced in such systems that requesters reward workers based on requesters' assessment on solution quality. The challenge is that requesters' assessment may not be accurate to reflect the intrinsic quality of a solution due to human factors like personal preferences or biases. In this work, we consider answering the following questions: How to design a mechanism to incentivize workers provide high quality solutions in the presence of such human factors? How to formally study the impact of human factors on workers' financial incentive to participate? We design a mechanism to incentivize workers to provide high-quality contributions, which is robust to human factors. Our incentive mechanism consists of a “task bundling scheme” and a “rating system”, which reward workers based on requesters' rating on the solution quality. We propose a probabilistic model to capture human factors, and quantify their impact on the incentive mechanism. We formulate an optimization framework to select appropriate rating system parameters, which can be viewed as a tradeoff between “system efficiency”, i.e., the total number of tasks can be solved given a fixed reward budget, and the “rating system complexity”, which determines the human cognitive cost and time in expressing ratings. We also formulate an optimization framework to select appropriate bundling size, which can tradeoff system efficiency against service delay (i.e., the waiting time to form a task bundle). Finally, we conduct experiments on a dataset from Elance. Experimental results show that our incentive mechanism achieves at least 99.95 percent of the theoretical maximum system efficiency with a service delay of at most 2.3639 hours. Furthermore, we discover that the rating system in Elance is too complex, and it should be simplified to a binary rating system (i.e., two rating points).","1939-1374","","10.1109/TSC.2016.2539954","GRF(grant numbers:415112); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7429762","Crowdsourcing;incentive mechanism;rating system;tradeoffs","Crowdsourcing;Human factors;Optimization;Chlorine;System analysis and design;Delays;Games","","30","","49","IEEE","9 Mar 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, since centralized MCS confronts severe security and privacy risks in reality, many researchers are devoted to building a decentralized MCS system based on blockchain. Despite the effectiveness of these schemes, they fail to offer anonymous authentication on the trust of MCS nodes, although privacy is a main concern in MCS and trust plays an important role in a series of MCS activities, such as worker selection and truth discovery. Nevertheless, anonymous authentication on trust is not a trivial issue since trust evaluation usually conflicts with anonymity, which is a necessary privacy requirement in an open MCS environment. To tackle this problem, we leverage Intel software guard extension (SGX) and propose a scheme to anonymously authenticate trust with trustworthy trust evaluation in a blockchain-based MCS system. The scheme employs an SGX-enabled cloud server to periodically alter user public/private key pairs and mix newly altered keys among a number of faked keys in order to ensure unlinkability. Besides, we consider the unique features of MCS and work out a novel trust evaluation method by aggregating both subjective feedback and objective behaviors. Finally, we conduct several analyses and experiments to illustrate its security and efficiency.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2020.3018878","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61672410,61802293); Academy of Finland(grant numbers:308087,314203,335262); National Postdoctoral Program for Innovative Talents(grant numbers:BX20180238); Project funded by China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(grant numbers:2018M633461); Key Laboratory of Information Network Security, Ministry of Public Security(grant numbers:C18614); Open Grant of the Tactical Data Link Lab of the 20th Research Institute of China Electronics Technology Group Corporation, China(grant numbers:CLDL-20182119); Shaanxi Innovation Team Project(grant numbers:2018TD-007); Higher Education Discipline Innovation Project(grant numbers:B16037); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9174637","Anonymous authentication;blockchain;mobile crowdsourcing (MCS);trust","Privacy;Authentication;Blockchain;Smart contracts;Internet of Things;Crowdsourcing","","30","","52","IEEE","24 Aug 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, most existing works assume that the qualities of workers are known in advance or cannot take all parties’ utilities into account together, especially having not considered the impact of social networks. Thus, we propose an incentive mechanism based on the multi-armed bandit and three-stage Stackelberg game, called TACT. We first design a greedy arm-pulling scheme to recruit workers, which not only can solve the exploration-exploitation dilemma but also takes workers’ social relations into account. Based on the recruitment results, we further design the utility functions incorporating with social benefits for workers, and model the payment computation problem as a three-stage Stackelberg game among all participants. Next, we derive the optimal strategy group so that each party can maximize its own utility to form a multi-win situation. Moreover, we theoretically prove the unique existence of Stackelberg equilibrium and the worst regret bound.

With strategic participants, the requester needs to reward the participants to introduce the incentives of participation. However, it is natural to ask whether it is worth introducing incentives if the total payment for eliciting incentives is too high. This paper addresses such a fundamental concern by designing a frugal mechanism with minimum payment used to procure the total amount of service contributions demanded. We design two mechanisms to provide the incentives of participation while minimizing the payment used by the requester. We first propose a frugal auction-based mechanism, which stimulates participants to truthfully report their information. We theoretically prove that the payment used is not more than the optimal cost (with no incentive considered) plus a bounded additive. We then design a Stackelberg-game-based mechanism, in which the requester fixes a certain total payment at the very beginning so as to encourage the participants to compete for it and participate in the task. We verify the existence of a unique Nash equilibrium (NE) and develop a novel algorithm to find the NE, as well as the optimal payment to extract the NE. Our simulation results show that the payment used in these mechanisms is close to the optimal solution with no incentive considered, while the extra payment caused by introducing truthfulness in auction-based mechanism is about twice that of the NE in Stakelberg-game-based mechanism.","1558-0008","","10.1109/JSAC.2017.2659278","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61300024,61672154,61632008,61320106007,61170164,61472079,61502099); Jiangsu Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:BK20130634,BK20140648); Funds for Distinguished Young Scholars of the Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province(grant numbers:BK2012020); Jiangsu Provincial Key Laboratory of Network and Information Security(grant numbers:BM2003201); China Specialized Research Fund for the Doctoral Program of Higher Education(grant numbers:20130092120036); Key Laboratory of Computer Network and Information Integration of Ministry of Education of China(grant numbers:93K-9); Collaborative Innovation Center of Wireless Communications Technology; Hong Kong Research Grant Council under GRF Project(grant numbers:11213114); NSFC-Guangdong Joint Fund(grant numbers:U1501254); Research Grants Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China, under Project CityU(grant numbers:117913); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7835200","Crowdsourcing;truthful mechanism design;frugality;Stackelberg-game;Nash equilibrium;fairness","Crowdsourcing;Procurement;Nash equilibrium;Additives;Algorithm design and analysis;Sensors;Resource management","","26","","44","IEEE","26 Jan 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Thus, various SC techniques have been studied for performance optimization, among which one of the major challenges is how to assign workers the tasks that they are really interested in and willing to perform. In this paper, we propose a novel preference-aware spatial task assignment system based on workers’ temporal preferences, which consists of two components: History-based Context-aware Tensor Decomposition (HCTD) for workers’ temporal preferences modeling and preference-aware task assignment. We model workers’ preferences with a three-dimension tensor (worker-task-time). Supplementing the missing entries of the tensor through HCTD with the assistant of historical data and other two context matrices, we recover workers’ preferences for different categories of tasks in different time slots. Several preference-aware individual task assignment algorithms are then devised, aiming to maximize the total number of task assignments at every time instance, in which we give higher priorities to the workers who are more interested in the tasks. In order to make our proposed framework applicable to more scenarios, we further optimize the original framework by proposing strategies to allow each task to be assigned to a group of workers such that the task can be completed by these workers simultaneously, wherein workers’ tolerable waiting time, consensus, and tasks’ rewards are taken into consideration.

Studies show that signal strength plays an important role on energy consumption of cellular data communications. While energy consumption can be minimized by accurately predicting signal strengths and reacting to it in real-time, the dynamic nature of wireless environments makes signal strengths highly unpredictable. In this paper, after analyzing in detail the signal strength variation and its impact on energy consumption, we propose to use crowdsourcing approach to optimize mobile devices’ energy efficiency by utilizing signal strength traces reported/shared by other users/devices in cellular networks. Via a comprehensive measurement study, we observe that signal strength traces collected from different devices are pseudo-identical, and they even exhibit similar threshold-based behaviors in the relationship between signal strength and device power consumption. Based on our observations, we propose a predictive scheduling algorithm that: (i) selects the right set of signal strength traces based on its location, (ii) applies a filter to smooth out signal strengths and hide abrupt changes, (iii) digitizes the signal strength to “good” and “bad” areas, and (iv) schedules transmissions based on power-throughput characteristics to optimize the transmission energy efficiency. To demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed algorithms, we prototype the crowdsourcing-based predicative scheduling algorithm on Android-based smartphones. Our experiment results from real-life driving tests demonstrate that, by leveraging others’ signal traces, mobile devices can save energy up to 35 percent compared to the conventional opportunistic scheduling, i.e., schedule transmissions only based on instantaneous channel conditions.","1558-0660","","10.1109/TMC.2014.2316517","Finnish funding agency for technology and innovation (Tekes) in Massive Scale Machine-to-Machine Service (MAMMotH)(grant numbers:Dnro 820/31/2011); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6786483","Energy consumption;network traffic scheduling;power control;prediction models;signal strength","Power demand;Throughput;Multiaccess communication;Spread spectrum communication;High definition video;Smart phones","","23","","32","IEEE","10 Apr 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To address this issue, we develop a differential privacy (DP)-enabled DNN learning framework, DNN-DP, that intentionally injects noise to the affine transformation of the input data features and provides DP protection for the crowdsourced sensitive training data. Specifically, we correspondingly estimate the importance of each feature related to target categories and follow the principle that less noise is injected into the more important feature to ensure the data utility of the model. Moreover, we design an adaptive coefficient for the added noise to accommodate the heterogeneous feature value ranges.

Most existing incentive mechanisms reward workers based on the comparison among workers’ reported solutions. However, these mechanisms are vulnerable to worker collusion, i.e., workers coordinate to misreport their solutions. We address such an issue by proposing a novel rewarding mechanism based on a ${truth detection}$truthdetection technology, which relies on the independent verification of the correctness of each worker’s response to some question with an imperfect accuracy. We model the interactions between the platform and workers as a two-stage Stackelberg game. In Stage I, the platform optimizes the reward mechanism parameters associated with truth detection to maximize its payoff. In Stage II, the workers decide their effort levels and reporting strategies to maximize their payoffs (which depend on the output of the truth detector). We analyze the game’s equilibrium and show that our proposed mechanism can effectively mitigate worker collusion. We also propose a novel rule, named filtered majority, for the platform to more effectively aggregate the workers’ solutions. Our proposed aggregation rule utilizes truth detection and outperforms the conventional simple majority rule. We further characterize the impact of the truth detection accuracy on the platform’s decisions. Surprisingly, under the simple majority rule, we show that as the truth detection accuracy improves, the platform should always incentivize more workers to exert effort and truthfully report. However, under our proposed filtered majority rule, we show that as the truth detection accuracy improves, in some cases, the platform should incentivize fewer workers and save costs.

At this moment, the most efficient way that could stop the epidemic is to leverage the contact tracing system to monitor people’s daily contact information and isolate the close contacts of COVID-19. However, the contact tracing data usually contains people’s sensitive information that they do not want to share with the contact tracing system and government. Conversely, the contact tracing system could perform better when it obtains more detailed contact tracing data. In this article, we treat the process of collecting contact tracing data from a crowdsourcing perspective in order to motivate users to contribute more contact tracing data and propose the incentive algorithm named CovidCrowd. Different from previous works where they ask users to contribute their data voluntarily, the government offers some reward to users who upload their contact tracing data to reimburse the privacy and data processing cost. We formulate the problem as a Stackelberg game and show there exists a Nash equilibrium for any user given the fixed reward value. Then, CovidCrowd computes the optimal reward value which could maximize the utility of the system. Finally, we conduct a large-scale simulation with thousands of users and evaluation with real-world data set. Both results show that CovidCrowd outperforms the benchmarks, e.g., the user participating level is improved by at least 13.2% for all evaluation scenarios.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2020.3049024","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2018YFC0910500); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:DUT20RC(3)039,DUT20RC(4)005,DUT19JC39,N182608004,N180101028); Key Research and Development Program of Liaoning Province(grant numbers:2019JH210100030,2020JH210100046); National Key Research and Development Projects(grant numbers:2019YFB1802600); Liaoning United Foundation(grant numbers:U1908214); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62002045,62072094,61872052,61872073,61672148); Natural Science Foundation of Liaoning Province(grant numbers:2019-MS-055); Liaoning Province Science and Technology Fund Project(grant numbers:2020MS086); CERNET Innovation Project(grant numbers:NGII20190504); Youth Science and Technology Star of Dalian(grant numbers:2018RQ45); Opening Project of Shanghai Trusted Industrial Control Platform(grant numbers:TICPSH202003017-ZC); Program for Liaoning Innovative Research Term in University(grant numbers:LT2016007); Program for the Liaoning Distinguished Professor, Program for Innovative Research Team in University of Liaoning Province; Science and Technology Innovation Fund of Dalian(grant numbers:2020JJ25CY001); PR of China Ministry of Education Distinguished Possessor Grant given to Prof. Obaidat(grant numbers:MS2017BJKJ003); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9312680","Contact tracing;COVID-19;incentive algorithm;Nash equilibrium;pandemic diseases;utility maximization","COVID-19;Games;Government;Privacy;Crowdsensing;Data privacy;Internet of Things","","22","","49","IEEE","4 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Most of existing 3D reconstruction methods require a mobile user to walk around the target area and reconstruct objectives with a hand-held camera, which is inefficient and time-consuming. To meet the requirements of delay intensive and resource hungry applications in 5G, we propose an edge computing-based photo crowdsourcing (EC-PCS) framework in this paper. The main objective is to collect a set of representative photos from ubiquitous mobile and Internet of Things (IoT) devices at the network edge for real-time 3D model reconstruction, with network resource and monetary cost considerations. Specifically, we first propose a photo pricing mechanism by jointly considering their freshness, resolution and data size. Then, we design a novel photo selection scheme to dynamically select a set of photos with the required target coverage and the minimum monetary cost. We prove the NP-hardness of such problem, and develop an efficient greedy-based approximation algorithm to obtain a near-optimal solution. Moreover, an optimal network resource allocation scheme is presented, in order to minimize the maximum uploading delay of the selected photos to the edge server. Finally, a 3D reconstruction algorithm and a 3D model caching scheme are performed by the edge server in real time. Extensive experimental results based on real-world datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our EC-PCS system over the existing mechanisms.","1558-0660","","10.1109/TMC.2020.3007654","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:U1711265,61972432,U1911201); Program for Guangdong Introducing Innovative and Entrepreneurial Teams(grant numbers:2017ZT07X355); Guangdong Provincial Pearl River Talents Program(grant numbers:2017GC010465); Guangdong Special Support Program(grant numbers:2017TX04X148); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:20lgpy135); Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation of Guangdong Province(grant numbers:2019A1515010030); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9134821","Three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction;multi-access edge computing;photo crowdsourcing","Three-dimensional displays;Solid modeling;Computational modeling;Crowdsourcing;Servers;Real-time systems;Image reconstruction","","21","","30","IEEE","7 Jul 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Traditional ways for road anomaly detection are either threshold-based detection techniques or feature-based detection techniques. However, road anomaly patterns from crowdsourcing data are often shifted in time and exhibit local distortions/noise, thus existing methods rely on the original sensor data greatly limit the accuracy of road anomaly detection. In this paper, we present a road anomaly detection model by learning scale-invariant features from the differences between small local segments of road anomaly samples. Specifically, the proposed model consists of two phases: 1) Road anomaly segmentation. The phase is designed to roughly extract road anomaly subsequence using piecewise aggregate approximation representation of sensor series data, and 2) Road anomaly detection. In this phase, we observe the differences among road anomaly classes are attributed to small local segments, then we learn scale-invariant features from these small local segments for road anomaly detection. To demonstrate the utility of our proposed model, we have performed a comprehensive experimental evaluation on two real-world datasets and one large-scale simulation dataset. The experimental results show our proposed model outperforms all baselines significantly in terms of road anomaly detection.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2918754","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61802343); Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province(grant numbers:LGF19F020019); Hangzhou Key Laboratory for IoT Technology and Application; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8721045","Road anomaly detection;mobile crowdsourcing;accelerometer readings;sliding window;scale-invariant feature","Roads;Feature extraction;Anomaly detection;Acceleration;Metals;Crowdsourcing","","20","","44","OAPA","23 May 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To solve the CM, a Stackelberg game approach is newly developed in this article to find rational and efficient strategies of task/incentive allocation. For the building energy efficiency retrofit, the challenge of CM is to handle mixed-integer decisions of energy service companies. We prove the existence of Stackelberg equilibrium (SE), which introduces the optimal budget, and the Nash equilibrium of task allocation. To compute the SE of CM, effective search algorithms are designed based on best response and optimization techniques. Simulation results have verified the CM and game theoretical approach.

Although several fundamental methods have been used to evaluate road roughness by employing smart probe cars, the accuracy of these methods is affected by factors, such as vehicle speed, sensor positions, and vehicle suspension systems. Also, the long-term application of these methods to the entire road network is also limited due to the high cost. Further, the widely used roughness indices do not reflect road users’ perception about road roughness as these indices are also affected by the accuracy of the roughness evaluation methods. Therefore, we propose a crowdsourcing based road roughness evaluation model which uses power spectral density accompanied with blind source separation technique to eliminate the vehicle effects. We also propose a road surface ranking based on majority voting algorithm for comparing roads based on their surface quality. Finally, the road surface roughness index is derived to widen the range of quality scale and capture roughness at fine granularity. The models are tested by real world experiments on different roads in Taiwan. The results show that the proposed model can accurately measure the roughness of roads, rank these roads and index them accordingly in a way that shows tiny differences in the road surface quality.","1558-0016","","10.1109/TITS.2020.3041681","Center for Open Intelligent Connectivity from the Featured Areas Research Center Program within the framework of the Higher Education Sprout Project by the Ministry of Education (MOE), Taiwan; Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST), Taiwan(grant numbers:MOST 109-2627-H-009-001); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9293169","Crowdsourcing;road roughness;vibration index;power spectral density","Roads;Rough surfaces;Surface roughness;Monitoring;Smart phones;Vibrations;Standards","","18","","36","IEEE","14 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In many applications, especially those aggregating or processing a large amount of data over large spatial regions or long spans of time or both, the workload would be too heavy for any CPS element (or node) to finish on its own. How to enable the CPS nodes to efficiently collaborate with each other to accommodate more CPS services is a very challenging problem and deserves systematic research. In this paper, we present a cross-layer optimization framework for hybrid crowdsourcing in the CPSs to facilitate heavy-duty computation. Particularly, by joint computing resource management, routing, and link scheduling, we formulate an offline finite-queue-aware CPS service maximization problem to crowdsource nodes' computing tasks in a CPS. We then find both lower and upper bounds on the optimal result of the problem. In addition, the lower bound result is proved to be a feasible result that guarantees all queues in the network are finite, i.e., network strong stability.

However, data annotation relies on untrained volunteers, making it difficult to control the quality of the annotation. Here, we propose a method to estimate the consistency of the annotations of human classifiers in citizen science projects. Since the performance of supervised machine learning systems decreases as the level of noise in the data increases, the method is able to rank human annotators by the consistency with which they annotate. Because the method uses the accuracy of an automatic classifier trained with these samples, it does not require ground truth or data annotated by other citizen scientists. The method allows reducing the number of annotations required for each sample by identifying the most efficient data annotators, as well as improving the overall quality of the data by giving higher weights to the classifications of the more consistent data annotators. The proposed method can also be used for improving the citizen science user experience by providing feedback in real time. Experimental results using a large citizen science project-Galaxy Zoo-and a subset of over 1.1 × 106 data annotations made by 4000 citizen scientists show Pearson correlation of 0.966 between the quality estimation provided by the method and the actual performance of the data annotators.

National or international organizations and agencies may be initiated to provide assistance but local agencies need to act as soon as possible, because they are familiar with the geographical location as well as the local conditions of the affected areas. Effective coordination of disaster assistance is often crucial, particularly when resources are limited in the local agencies and the demands are more. In such conditions, it becomes a challenging job for the agencies to distribute resources so that the resources are optimally used. This article is initiated to address the challenging fact by introducing the concept of priority measure for demands. In this regard, ranking of the affected areas based on resource requirement for a disaster scenario is evaluated through a multicriteria decision-making process. A formula is developed to find the numerical value of priority factor collecting the responses of requirement of relief materials using information crowdsourcing. To this contingent, a three-echelon emergency solid transportation problem is formulated, in which the demand with the most priority is fulfilled by the local agencies in echelon-I, and the remaining demand is fulfilled by the other national or international agencies in echelon-II along with a restoration of local agencies in echelon-III. A numerical example is presented for the sake of model performance and to test the convergence using LINGO and CPLEX optimization solvers. The model is also designed using a genetic algorithm to obtain the optimal solution. Moreover, a brief analysis of the model is presented by considering 11 different numerical instances to enhance the efficacy of the model in real-life applications.","1558-0040","","10.1109/TEM.2020.3015775","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9194343","Disaster management;information crowdsourcing;multicriteria decision-making (MCDM);priority of demand;three-echelon solid transportation problem (STP)","Crowdsourcing;Earthquakes;Mathematical model;Disaster management;Logistics;Numerical models;Transportation","","15","","74","IEEE","10 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The open policy now applied to LANDSAT data, and the starting of Sentinel operations, whose data are freely distributed even for commercial purposes, tore down a financial barrier to wider use of EO data in business activities, especially those with a narrow financial margin. Notwithstanding the flood of open data, some aspects of the Earth surface still escape satisfactory monitoring from space, especially in complex, anthropic areas. Due to insufficient spatial resolution, lack of visibility, or unsuitable revisit times, important pieces of information may not emerge from spaceborne data. In situ sensing can represent a vital source of integrative information to fill the aforementioned gaps and build a more complete and accurate picture of the situation and trends in the observed area. The contribution of in situ sensing was envisaged quite early in the Earth observation history, but for a long time it remained limited to tailored sensors displaced in strategic locations. With the increasing circulation of smartphones, a new opportunity has recently opened for a different paradigm of in situ sensing, offering a huge mass of additional data by tapping on data generated by mobile devices. Even if such data may be less specialized and less usable for various reasons, the sheer size of the data flow ensures that statistical analysis will pick possible useful clues. The increasing availability of mobile connections has indeed revived the concept of “crowdsourcing,” i.e., entrusting a pool of actors with problem solution or information collection tasks. In our scenario, individuals carrying mobile devices can become “citizen sensors” on a voluntary basis by contributing data through their connected terminals. Even considering the typical issues of crowdsourced data, like quality and reliability, the balance remains definitely positive. This paper provides an overview of the theme and discusses how it relates to an important, coordinated EO initiative like Copernicus. It finally presents a specific example realized in the framework of a recent research project under the Copernicus aegis.","1558-2256","","10.1109/JPROC.2017.2727284","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7999179","Citizen sensor;Copernicus;crowdsourcing;information fusion;open policy","Sensors;Crowdsourcing;Earth Observing System;Geospatial analysis;Market research;Mobile communication;Remote sensing;Social network services;Spatial resolution","","14","","107","CCBY","1 Aug 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Therefore, we believe it is practical and beneficial to understand users' privacy expectations on various mobile apps and help them mitigate privacy risks introduced by smartphones. To achieve this objective, we propose and implement PriWe, a system based on crowdsourcing driven by users who contribute privacy permission settings of the apps installed on their smartphones.

We deployed PriWe in the real world for evaluation.

To efficiently perform such tasks and guarantee the best possible quality of returned results, optimizing the worker recruitment and task assignment processes must be conducted. Because both workers and task requesters impose certain criteria, this procedure is not obvious. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel formulation of the SMCS recruitment where task matching and worker scheduling are jointly optimized. A Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP) is first developed to optimally maximize the quality of matching measured as a weighted score function of different recruitment metrics while determining the trajectory of each selected worker executing tasks. To cope with NP-hardness, we propose a heuristic SMCS recruitment approach allowing the achievement of sub-optimal matching and recruitment solution by iteratively solving a weighted bipartite graph problem. Simulation results illustrate the performance of the SMCS framework for selected scenarios and show that our proposed SMCS recruitment algorithm outperforms an existing greedy recruitment approach. Moreover, compared to the optimal MILP solution, the proposed SMCS recruitment approach achieves close results with significant computational time saving.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2979624","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9028164","Crowdsourcing;Internet-of-things;recruitment;scheduling;smart city","Task analysis;Recruitment;Crowdsourcing;Resource management;Monitoring;Servers;Complexity theory","","13","","36","CCBY","9 Mar 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Traditional drive testing approach provides a quality measurement for each area and the quality measurement is obtained from the equipment in a moving vehicle. This approach suffers from the limitations of high costs, low coverage, and out-of-date values. In this paper, we propose a novel crowdsourcing approach for the task of network quality estimation, which incurs little costs and provides timely and accurate quality estimation. The proposed approach collects quality measurements from individual end users within a certain network or cell coverage area, and then aggregates these measurements to obtain a global measurement of network quality. We propose an effective aggregation scheme which infers the information weights of end users and incorporates such weights into the estimation of network quality. Experiments are conducted on two datasets collected from citywide 3G networks, which involve 616,796 users and 22,715 cells. We validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach compared with baseline method. From the aggregated measurement results, we observe some interesting patterns about network quality, which can be explained by network usage and traffic behavior.

In this paper, we propose and develop a novel worker recruitment game in socially aware MCS, i.e., Acceptance-aware Worker Recruitment (AWR). To accommodate MCS task invitation diffusion over social networks, we design a Random Diffusion model, where workers randomly propagate task invitations to social neighbors, and receivers independently make a decision whether to accept or not. Based on the diffusion model, we formulate the AWR game as a combinatorial optimization problem, which strives to search a subset of seed workers to maximize overall task acceptance under a pre-given incentive budget. We prove its NP hardness, and devise a meta-heuristic-based evolutionary approach named MA-RAWR to balance exploration and exploitation during the search process.

First, we propose a novel reputation incentive mechanism based on the behaviors of responders. Then, we employ the offensive and defensive game to model the interactions between the fog server platform and the responders, whereby a social welfare optimization problem is formulated to maximize the social welfare of the system. Next, the game equilibriums are found by using the replicator dynamic equation while the game stability is discussed.

In most existing works, the platform selects workers based on the requester and worker information, which suffers from serious privacy issues. Some works have considered privacy issues, but they still suffer from either of two limitations: (i) Privacy of the requester and worker cannot be protected simultaneously; (ii) Third-party trusted entities are usually required. Motivated by this, we focus on protecting the privacy of both the requester and the worker without third-party entities while selecting workers. We use randomized response, a widely recognized and prevalent privacy model achieving Local Differential Privacy (LDP), to jointly protect the privacy of workers’ locations and charges based on the location-charge correlation. For the requester, we present a novel mechanism called randomized matrix multiplication to hide the real task locations. More importantly, we prove that the worker selection based on the protected information is non-submodular and NP-hard, which cannot be addressed in polynomial time. To this end, we present an approximate algorithm to solve the problem efficiently, of which the effectiveness is measured by the approximation ratio, i.e., the ratio of the optimal solution to the approximate solution. Finally, simulations based on real-world datasets illustrate that our worker selection outperforms the state-of-the-art method on both privacy protection and worker selection.","1941-0018","","10.1109/TDSC.2022.3186023","National Key R&D Program of China(grant numbers:2021ZD0112501,2021ZD0112502); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61772230,61972450,62072209,62102161); CCF-Baidu Open Fund(grant numbers:2021PP15002000); China Scholarship Council(grant numbers:202006170173); National Science Foundation(grant numbers:CNS 1824440,CNS 1828363,CNS 1757533,CNS 1629746,CNS 1651947,CNS 1564128); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9806321","Bilateral privacy-preserving;local differential privacy;spatial crowdsourcing;worker selection","Privacy;Task analysis;Crowdsourcing;Differential privacy;Data privacy;Correlation;Data analysis","","11","","44","IEEE","24 Jun 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

These providers can potentially set unfair expensive prices for their services. In this article, we propose a novel crowdsourcing-based approach for fair wireless service pricing in the Internet of Things (IoT). In our considered oligopoly, the regulatory sets a dynamic maximum allowed price of service to prevent anti-trust behavior and unfair service pricing. We propose a three-tire pricing model, where the regulator, wireless network providers, and clients are the players of our game. Our method takes client preferences into account in pricing and discovers the fair service pricing just above the marginal costs of each network provider. Our results show that our model is not prone to collusion and will converge only if one network announces the fair price.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2020.3030881","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9223690","Crowdsource pricing;fair pricing;heterogeneous wireless networks","Pricing;Regulators;Resource management;Internet of Things;Wireless networks;Crowdsourcing","","11","","26","IEEE","14 Oct 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In the case of historical documents, their transcription allows to preserve cultural heritage because of the amount of historical data contained in those documents. The transcription process can employ state-of-the-art handwritten text recognition systems in order to obtain an initial transcription. This transcription is usually not good enough for the quality standards, but that may speed up the final transcription of the expert. In this framework, the use of collaborative transcription applications (crowdsourcing) has risen in the recent years, but these platforms are mainly limited by the use of non-mobile devices. Thus, the recruiting initiatives get reduced to a smaller set of potential volunteers. In this paper, an alternative that allows the use of mobile devices is presented. The proposal consists of using speech dictation of handwritten text lines. Then, by using multimodal combination of speech and handwritten text images, a draft transcription can be obtained, presenting more quality than that obtained by only using handwritten text recognition. The speech dictation platform is implemented as a mobile device application, which allows for a wider range of population for recruiting volunteers. A real acquisition on the contents of a Spanish historical handwritten book was obtained with the platform. This data was used to perform experiments on the behaviour of the proposed framework.

Two measures, location entropy and results accuracy, are used to evaluate the performance of location privacy protection. We theoretically and experimentally confirm the security and accuracy of the obfuscation approach. The results of experiments show that: a) hiding workers’ location from the requester reduces the quality of SC; and b) obfuscation arithmetic with appropriate obfuscation coefficients protects workers’ location privacy with little effect on SC quality.

We employ a radio propagation model where the path loss exponent and the transmitted power are unknown with Gaussian priors whose hyper-parameters are estimated by applying the empirical Bayes method. We consider the locations of the sensors to be imperfectly known, which entails that they represent another source of error in the model. The propagation model includes shadowing, which is considered to be a zero-mean Gaussian process where the correlation of attenuation between two spatial points is quantified by an exponential function of the distance between the points. The location of the transmitter is also unknown and is estimated from the data. We propose to estimate time-varying RSS fields by a recursive Bayesian method and crowdsourcing.

These are gesture based languages where the subjects use hands and facial expressions to perform different gestures. There are hundreds of different sign languages in the world. Furthermore, like natural languages, there exist different dialects for many sign languages. In order to facilitate the deaf community several different repositories of video gestures are available for many sign languages of the world. These video based repositories do not support the development of an automated language translation systems. This research aims to investigate the idea of engaging the deaf community for the development and validation of a parallel corpus for a sign language and its dialects. As a principal contribution, this research presents a framework for building a parallel corpus for sign languages by harnessing the powers of crowdsourcing with editorial manager, thus it engages a diversified set of stakeholders for building and validating a repository in a quality controlled manner. It further presents processes to develop a word-level parallel corpus for different dialects of a sign language; and a process to develop sentence-level translation corpus comprising of source and translated sentences. The proposed framework has been successfully implemented and involved different stakeholders to build corpus. As a result, a word-level parallel corpus comprising of the gestures of almost 700 words of Pakistan Sign Language (PSL) has been developed. While, a sentence-level translation corpus comprising of more than 8000 sentences for different tenses has also been developed for PSL. This sentence-level corpus can be used in developing and evaluating machine translation models for natural to sign language translation and vice-versa. While the machine-readable word level parallel corpus will help in generating avatar based videos for the translated sentences in different dialects of a sign language.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3091433","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9462917","Crowdsourcing;HamNoSys;parallel corpus;sign language dictionary;sign writing","Assistive technology;Gesture recognition;Dictionaries;Buildings;Machine translation;Crowdsourcing;Avatars","","7","","50","CCBY","23 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To solve this issue, we propose a blockchain, especially, smart contract based scheme that can achieve decentralized and on-demand crowdsourcing for video transcoding, which remarkably mitigates the transcoding overhead. Specifically, our scheme consists of four key components such as employers, workers, task allocation, and payment. An employer initializes the smart contract, releases the task, and initiates the smart contract. Workers bid for the task, and the successful bidder will obtain the task and execute the task. The task allocation mechanism and the payment mechanism can guarantee the profits of both and encourage both as well. Moreover, the smart contract consists of the bidding contract and the task execution contract.

In this experiment, the crowd generated hypotheses about factors that make one home different from another in terms of monthly energy usage. To implement this concept, we deployed a web-based system within which 627 residential electricity customers posed 632 questions that they thought predictive of energy usage. While this occurred, the same group provided 110 573 answers to these questions as they accumulated. Thus, users both suggested the hypotheses that drive a predictive model and provided the data upon which the model is built. We used the resulting question and answer data to build a predictive model of monthly electric energy consumption, using random forest regression. Because of the sparse nature of the answer data, careful statistical work was needed to ensure that these models are valid.

Pedestrian dead reckoning partly resolves the problem by using a variety of sensors to provide a relatively accurate position; however, the accumulation of errors is yet to be successfully addressed. In this study, we introduce a highly accurate positioning method that implements error correction based on a crowdsourced database. The proposed method constructs learning data without manual effort and the need of reference points in the target area, and improves positioning accuracy by continuously learning and correcting the error distribution of the inertial sensor. The obtained positioning accuracy was approximately 3.38 m for roughly 83% of the collected fingerprints. Furthermore, the error correction algorithm improved the moving distance and direction accuracy by up to 2.86% and 25.7%, respectively.

Current recruitment systems assume that a pre-defined pool of workers is available. However, this assumption is not always true, especially in cold-start situations, where a new MCS task has just been released. Additionally, studies show that up to 96% of the available candidates are usually not willing to perform the assigned tasks. To tackle these issues, recent works use Online Social Networks (OSNs) and Influence Maximization (IM) to advertise about the desired MCS tasks through influencers, aiming to build larger pools. However, these works suffer from several limitations, such as 1) the lack of group-based selection methods when choosing influencers, 2) the lack of a well-defined worker recruitment process following IM, 3) and the non-dynamicity of the recruitment process, where the workers who refuse to perform the task are not substituted. In this paper, an Influence- and Interest-based Worker Recruitment System (IIWRS), using OSNs, is proposed. The proposed system has two main components: 1) an MCS-, group-, and interest-based IM approach, using a Genetic Algorithm, to select a set of influencers from the network to advertise about the MCS tasks, and 2) a dynamic worker recruitment process which considers the social attributes of workers, and is able to substitute those who do not accept to perform the assigned tasks. Empirical studies are performed using real-life datasets, while comparing IIWRS with existing benchmarks.","1932-4537","","10.1109/TNSM.2022.3217689","ADEK - Abu Dhabi Department of Education and Knowledge (AARE18-106); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9931341","Crowdsourcing;recruitment;social networks;influence maximization","Task analysis;Recruitment;Quality of service;Social networking (online);Genetic algorithms;Costs;Machine learning algorithms","","7","","62","IEEE","27 Oct 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Such a centralized design requires powerful resource capacity and often cannot accomplish the urgent demands due to the unpredictable network latency. In order to ensure the scalability of systems and the quality of services, we study the distributed SC (DSC), where a diversity of location-relative services provided by various service providers (SPs) can deploy on edge clouds (ECs) with low time latency. Since the edge resources are limited, SPs need to compete for edge resources so as to deploy their desired SC services, and the requested resources must be allocated together to meet the demand of the service. We first design a gated recurrent unit with particle filter (GRUPF) network for SPs to predict future resource demands so as to participate in the competitions judiciously. Then, we model the competitive edge resource allocation problem between SPs and ECs as a combinatorial auction process. Due to the NP-hardness of this problem, an approximation algorithm is proposed to tackle it. Moreover, the leakage of private information such as bids may incur severe economic damage, and most existing studies usually rely on a trusted third party to provide rigorous privacy protection. Therefore, we customize a novel differentially private resource auction (DRA) mechanism, and design a bid confusion strategy based on differential privacy. Through theoretical analysis, we prove that the DRA mechanism meets some desired properties, including  $\epsilon $ -differential privacy, individual rationality, computational efficiency, and  $\gamma $ -truthfulness. Additionally, we corroborate the significant performances of DRA through extensive simulations on synthetic and real-world data sets.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2022.3183006","National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)(grant numbers:62172386,61872330,61572457,61572336,61379132,61936015,U1709217); NSF(grant numbers:CNS1824440,CNS1828363,CNS1757533,CNS1618398,CNS1651947,CNS1564128); NSF of Jiangsu Province in China(grant numbers:BK20191194,BK20131174,BK2009150); Anhui Initiative in Quantum Information Technologies(grant numbers:AHY150300); National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2017YFB0802302); Natural Science Research Project of Jiangsu Higher Education Institution(grant numbers:18KJA520010); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9795698","Auction mechanism;deep learning;differential privacy;distributed spatial crowdsourcing (DSC);particle filter (PF);resource usage prediction","Servers;Crowdsourcing;Cryptography;Task analysis;Resource management;Privacy;Internet of Things","","7","","50","IEEE","14 Jun 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Peer grading also offers a promising solution for scaling evaluation and learning to large-scale educational systems. A key challenge in peer grading is motivating peers to grade diligently and provide a high-quality evaluation. Spot-checking (SC) mechanisms, allowing instructors to check evaluations, can prevent peer collusion where peers grade arbitrarily and coordinate to report the uninformative grade. However, existing SC mechanisms unrealistically assume that peers have the same grading reliability and cost. This is limiting in practice, where we would expect peers to differ in reliability and cost. This article proposes the general Optimal SC (OptSC) model of determining the probability that each assignment needs to be checked to maximize assignments' evaluation accuracy aggregated from peers and takes into consideration: 1) peers' heterogeneous characteristics and 2) peers' strategic grading behaviors to maximize their own utility. We prove that the bilevel OptSC is NP-hard to solve. By exploiting peers' grading behaviors, we first formulate a single-level relaxation to approximate OptSC. By further exploiting structural properties of the relaxed problem, we propose an efficient algorithm to that relaxation, which also gives a good approximation of the original OptSC. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real data sets show significant advantages of the proposed algorithm over existing approaches.","2329-924X","","10.1109/TCSS.2020.2998732","National Key Research and Development Project of China(grant numbers:2019YFB1405000); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61932007,61806053,61807008); Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province of China(grant numbers:BK20171363,BK20180356,BK20180369); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9120177","Crowdsourcing;game theory;optimization;peer grading systems (PGSs)","Reliability;Approximation algorithms;Calibration;Crowdsourcing;Task analysis;Optimization;Gold","","7","","55","IEEE","18 Jun 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, we propose an energy bank-based crowdsourcing framework and an incentive mechanism for energy conservation in wireless-powered task-oriented networks. An employer device outsources the whole or a part of its task to several worker devices and pays them energy as reward. Through energy-service trading, the employer consumes less energy and workers make energy profits. The virtual energy bank keeps accounts for all devices, authenticates the trading, and settles payments through a lossless bookkeeping-like manner. We analyze the employer's expense-minimized and workers' profit-maximized decisions and prove that the optimal decisions compose a Stackelberg equilibrium. To quantify the potential in energy saving, we further apply the framework to a relay-based sensor network where a source employs relays to forward data with a minimum rate requirement. An algorithm is developed for the NP-hard expense minimization problem.

Workers will utilize the announced information to determine the likelihood of obtaining a reward. We first study the case where the platform and workers share the same prior regarding the average worker accuracy (but only the platform observes the realized value). We consider two types of workers: (1) naive workers who fully trust the platform's announcement, and (2) strategic workers who update prior belief based on the announcement. For naive workers, we show that the platform should always announce a high average accuracy to maximize its payoff. However, this is not always optimal when facing strategic workers, and the platform may benefit from announcing an average accuracy lower than the actual value.

However, how to quantify the quality of the gathered fingerprint data is still not addressed well in the design of incentive mechanism for MCS-based fingerprint collection. In this paper, a sensing quality metric is proposed to characterize the joint impact of users' privacy protection and the spatial coverage of the submitted data. Given a limited budget, a basic incentive mechanism is devised to recruit appropriate users to maximize sensing quality. Considering that the cost of each user is regarded as private information and users may be attempted to misreport their costs to increase the revenue. Hence, an auction-based incentive mechanism is proposed to achieve the truthfulness of users' costs, which is truthful, individually rational, computationally efficient and budget feasible. Simulation results show that our proposed schemes outperform the baseline schemes and the experiment with real-world data is carried out to evaluate the performance of our proposed basic incentive mechanism.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2974909","China Scholarship Council(grant numbers:201706690030); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9001141","Local differential privacy;incentive mechanism;auction theory;crowdsourced fingerprint collection","Sensors;Privacy;Measurement;Task analysis;Crowdsourcing","","5","","39","CCBY","18 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this problem, customers announce requests on a crowdsourced delivery platform to deliver orders from a depot to their destinations and crowdsourced drivers are willing to make a detour to deliver orders in exchange for rewards provided by the platform. The crowdsourced drivers have preference lists over groups of orders based on their profits and meanwhile each order has a preference list over crowdsourced drivers based on the drivers’ arrival times at the depot. According to their preference lists, to maximize profits, crowdsourced drivers need to consider routing and scheduling decisions for delivering orders. This crowdsourced driver-order matching problem is considered to be a non-cooperative game between crowdsourced drivers. A Nash equilibrium for such a non-cooperative game is a stable matching between crowdsourced drivers and orders. We propose two exact algorithms to find stable matchings and develop a heuristic algorithm to find feasible matchings for large scale problem. The results from computational experiments demonstrate that the proposed approaches are highly efficient and effective, and the matching rate of stable matching is larger than that of feasible matching.

Different from the traditional content delivery networks and overlay peer-to-peer networks, crowdsourcing-based platforms, e.g., Thunder Crystal, deliver HD videos by renting agents' bandwidth and storage resources. Cash will be rewarded to agents based on agents' upload traffic. Online video providers, i.e., Tencent Video and YouKu, pay Thunder Crystal for its video distribution service. Therefore, a critical problem for Thunder Crystal is to evaluate the performance it can achieve, which determines Thunder Crystal's competitiveness and its bargaining power with online video providers. Although previously studied proportional video replication and random request scheduling strategy are implemented by Thunder Crystal, the system performance cannot be evaluated by simply using existing models, because of its novel business model. To address this problem, this paper proposes a theoretical framework that can analyze the performance for synchronized streaming, video-on-demand (VoD) streaming, and video downloading, which are all supported by Thunder Crystal. A differentiated bandwidth allocation is designed to boost Thunder Crystal's streaming performance by assigning downloading users more fluctuating bandwidth, which only slightly degrades downloading performance.

Thus, many researchers aim at various task assignment methods in SC. However, existing works generally consider workers’ location and preference categories separately. Ignorance of the correlation between them can often lead to poor assignment results. In this article, we propose a location-and-preference joint prediction model (JPM) to predict workers’ locations and preference categories jointly at each sample timestamp. Based on the predictive location probability distribution and preference probability distribution, we elaborately design a greedy multiattribute joint task assignment algorithm (MAJA) to maximize the average number of completed tasks under constraints. Then, an overall procedure incorporating the JPM and MAJA, called the location-and-preference joint prediction-based task assignment (LPJTA), is implemented to focus on assigning tasks to workers who are near the task location and willing to perform the task based on predicting locations and preference categories. We theoretically analyze the time complexity and approximation ratio of the proposed methods and construct extensive experiments on three real datasets to empirically verify their effectiveness, comparing with the state-of-the-art baselines.","1937-4151","","10.1109/TCAD.2022.3188960","National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)(grant numbers:U19A2061,61772228); National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2017YFC1502306); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation Funded Project(grant numbers:2021M701388); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9816080","Deep learning;joint prediction;spatial crowdsourcing (SC);task assignment","Task analysis;Sensors;Predictive models;Servers;Crowdsourcing;Trajectory;Prediction algorithms","","3","","46","IEEE","6 Jul 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Here, a Local DP-based dynamic worker location protection (LDPDW) scheme is proposed to achieve high-quality task allocation and locally protect the correlation and location privacy of dynamic workers. Specifically, LDPDW generates noisy high correlated graph classes and obfuscates the worker locations in a static case by adopting a LDP-based correlation graph (LDPCG) algorithm and distance score-based LDP (DSLDP) algorithm, thereby achieving controlled noise addition and ensuring the correlation and location privacy. To support the privacy-preserving dynamic locations, a dynamic correlation graph-based location obfuscation (DCGLO) algorithm is proposed to allocate reasonable privacy budget  $\epsilon $ , which ensures the data utility. Finally, a linear acceptance model-based task allocation (LAMTA) algorithm is used to allocate tasks to the workers with high acceptance rates.

Therefore, application owners and even site reliability engineers (SREs) cannot effectively resort to those methods when the microservice systems lack such a comprehensive monitoring infrastructure. In this article, we develop DyCause, a crowdsourcing solution to the asymmetric diagnostic information problem. Our solution collects the operational status of kernel services collaboratively from the user space and initiates diagnosis on demand. Without the requirement of any architectural or functional infrastructure, it is both fast and lightweight to deploy DyCause in a microservice system. In order to discover the fine-grained dynamic causalities between services during the anomaly, we also design an efficient algorithm based on statistical analysis. Based on this algorithm, we can also analyze the anomaly propagation paths within the microservice system and generate a better interpretable diagnosis. In our evaluation, we test DyCause in a controlled simulation environment and a real-world cloud system. Our results have shown that DyCause has the best accuracy and efficiency among several state-of-the-art methods and is more robust in terms of parameters.","1941-0018","","10.1109/TDSC.2022.3233915","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62072006,92167104); Science and Technology on Communication Networks Laboratory(grant numbers:6142104200103); ByteDance University Research Project; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10005849","Root cause analysis;microservice system;dynamic service dependency;crowdsourcing","Microservice architectures;Kernel;Heuristic algorithms;Cloud computing;Crowdsourcing;Clustering algorithms;Extraterrestrial measurements","","3","","42","IEEE","4 Jan 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, we propose that similar platforms can form an alliance to make full use of the global service supply through cooperation. We name the problem as Global Task Assignment (GTA), in which platforms are allowed to hire idle workers from other platforms to improve the profit of all the platforms together. Different from relevant works, the decision-makers in GTA are platforms rather than individual workers, which can better assign workers in all platforms and improve the overall profit. We design an auction-based incentive mechanism (AIM), to motivate platforms to rent idle workers to other platforms so that increase their own profit. Based on the mechanism, we propose a greedy-based assignment algorithm (BaseGTA), in which platforms greedily maximizes their current profit. We further propose a prediction-based assignment algorithm (ImpGTA), in which platforms make decisions based on the spatial-temporal distribution in the future time.

Normally, skilled engineers are familiar with threat scenarios and the attack/defense skills, but they have no motivation to develop hands-on experiments for education. In contrast, the faculties are good at teaching and training but they have no resource or experience to deploy lots of hands-on experiments by themselves.

However, it is currently unclear which haptic properties (e.g., hardness and weight) of desired targets should be rendered with haptic displays, and how they should be rendered. To address these issues, we conducted an experiment with 600 Japanese participants via crowdsourcing. Among the 600 participants, we identified potential users of haptic displays and analyzed their responses for each target. For each desired target, we identified the haptic properties in relation to which a “need for consistency” was felt by potential users between their expectations and actual impressions during touching. We also identified the haptic properties in relation to which a “biased impression” was held by potential users for each target. For example, potential users responded that cats were soft and that the actual impression of softness during touching needed to be consistent with their impression.

Some SC tasks cannot be completed by a single worker due to their complexity, but rather must be assigned to and completed by a group of users. Achieving such group assignments that satisfy all group members evenly is an open challenge. To address this challenge, we propose a novel preference-aware group task assignment framework encompassing two components: Mutual Information-based Preference Modeling (MIPM) and Preference-aware Group Task Assignment (PGTA). The MIPM component learns the preferences of groups contrastively by maximizing the mutual information between workers and worker groups based on worker-task and group-task interaction data and by using an attention mechanism to weight group members adaptively. In addition, curriculum negative sampling is adopted to generate a small number of negative workers for each worker group, following the principles of curriculum learning. Next, the PGTA component offers an optimal task assignment algorithm that employs tree decomposition to assign tasks to appropriate worker groups, with the aim of maximizing the number of task assignments while prioritizing more interested groups when assigning tasks. The task assignment framework also features preference-constrained pruning of unpromising worker groups to speed up the assignment process.

However, even with recent advances in computational modeling and data acquisition, deep learning models require substantial amounts of good quality reference data to effectively self-learn internal representations of input imagery. The classical approach for coastal mapping requires experts to transcribe in situ records and delineate polygons from high-resolution imagery such that FCNs can self-learn. However, labeling by a single individual limits the training data, whereas crowdsourcing labels can increase the volume of training data, but may compromise label quality and consistency. In this article, we assessed the reliability of crowdsourced labels on a complex multiclass problem domain for estuarine vegetation and unvegetated sediment. An interobserver variability experiment was conducted in order to assess the statistical differences in crowdsourced annotations for plant species and sediment. The participants were grouped based on their discipline and level of expertise, and the statistical differences were evaluated using Cochran's Q-test and the annotation accuracy of each group to determine observation biases. Given the crowdsourced labels, FCNs were trained with majority-vote annotations from each group to check whether observation biases were propagated to FCN performance. Two scenarios were examined: first, a direct comparison of FCNs trained with transcribed in situ labels and crowdsourced labels from each group was established. Then, transcribed in situ labels were supplemented with crowdsourced labels to investigate the feasibility of training FCNs with crowdsourced labels in coastal mapping applications. We show that annotations sourced from discipline experts (ecologists and geomorphologists) familiar with the study site were more accurate than experts with no prior knowledge of the site and nonexperts, with our results confirming that biases in participant annotation were propagated in FCN performance. Furthermore, FCNs trained with a combined dataset of in situ and crowdsourced labels performed better than FCNs trained on the same imagery with in situ labels.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2023.3312820","Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science; EA; Natural Environment Research Council; Industrial CASE(grant numbers:NE/R007888/1); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10243090","Convolutional neural network (CNN);crowdsourcing;deep learning (DL);multispectral;remote sensing","Annotations;Sea measurements;Training;Sediments;Biological system modeling;Remote sensing;Image resolution;Deep learning","","1","","63","CCBY","7 Sep 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, we explore delay sensitive and network resource constrained traffic allocation for mobile device-to-device crowdsourcing. With the requirement of restricted node storage and link bandwidth, we first formulate a non-linear traffic allocation optimization problem that would be at least as hard as NP-hard. In order to practically solve it, based on the submodular property, we propose an approximation algorithm and a distributed heuristic in the same design principle. We implement the latter on Dell Streak tablets and deploy an experiment with 21 nodes for a period of three weeks. Moreover, we extract the implementation codes from the prototype and run simulations using the Haggle trace to study its performance trend. The experiment and simulation outcomes verify that the proposed mechanisms achieve the close-to-optimal performance with affordable computation complexity, which can be easily implanted in practical network environment.","1558-0857","","10.1109/TCOMM.2018.2796614","National Science Foundation(grant numbers:CNS-1528004); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8267024","Delay-constrained;crowdsourcing;traffic;optimization;prototype;experiment","Crowdsourcing;Device-to-device communication;Mobile communication;Bandwidth;Task analysis;Mobile computing;Resource management","","1","","43","IEEE","23 Jan 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, it is challenging to ensure the accuracy of shape- and connectivity-related information on road networks when this is extracted from massive amounts of data. To address this challenge, this paper proposes an inertia mutation energy model (IMEM) to extract and mine information on road networks based on crowdsourced trajectories by using features of images of vehicular trajectories to mine the connectivity between roads. The central assumption of the model is that a road segment may have inertial energy to extend to another road segment that decreases in case of the change in direction. Three critical steps are involved in extracting information concerning roads. First, images of the trajectory and corresponding feature images are constructed, and high-quality trajectories are filtered to split the road into several segments. Second, the IMEM is proposed to measure the potential extension of each road segment with the aim of mining connectivity-related information between the given trajectories. Finally, the centerline of the road is obtained using mathematical morphology and a thinning algorithm. The proposed algorithm was tested by using Global Position System trajectories of the Didi Taxi in Wuhan, China, and the results show that it reduced time cost by over 99% compared with vector algorithms proposed in the literature. Moreover, it enhanced the precision of the results of extraction by 10%–20% compared with traditional kernel density evaluation algorithms.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2959825","National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program)(grant numbers:2017YFB0503802); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:41771473,41231171); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8933513","Crowdsourced trajectory data;connectivity;data mining;road reconstruction","Roads;Trajectory;Global Positioning System;Data mining;Feature extraction;Crowdsourcing;Hidden Markov models","","1","","57","CCBY","16 Dec 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Comparing with traditional location image database construction, crowdsourced image database has massive advantages, e.g., much richer information for location, with various angles, timestamps, distances and weather information, providing useful potential for high recognition precision. However, when capturing the crowdsourced images, it is inevitable to have various disturbances on these location images, for example, moving vehicles and pedestrians, hindering the realization of potential. To address this challenge, we first propose a Rich Common Crucial Feature (RCCF) detection framework to exclude unimportant visual SURF features from crucial features. To achieve a good balance between the efficiency and accuracy, we further propose an RCCF based Visual Hash Bits (VHB) scheme to encode RCCF features into hash bits to vote for most matching images.

To reduce the impact of noise on label quality, many noise correction algorithms have been proposed in recent years. However, most of them are hard to fully utilize the joint information of the original attribute view and multiple noisy label view. Motivated by multi-view learning, in this article, we propose a dual-view noise correction (DVNC) algorithm. Benefiting from the complementary and consensus principle, DVNC can fully utilize the joint information of two views and thus enhance the effect of noise correction. In DVNC, we first construct the original attribute view and multiple noisy label view for each instance and, respectively, train a classifier on each view. Then, we use the trained two classifiers to filter each noise instance and thus obtain a clean set and noise set. Finally, we train a classifier on the clean set to correct each instance in the noise set via reclassifying it as the class with the maximum posterior probability. The experimental results on simulated and real-world data sets indicate that DVNC significantly outperforms all the other noise correction algorithms used for comparison.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2023.3244547","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62276241); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10052665","Class probability estimation;crowdsourcing learning;multi-view learning;noise correction","Noise measurement;Crowdsourcing;Internet of Things;Prediction algorithms;Clustering algorithms;Labeling;Entropy","","","","31","IEEE","24 Feb 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Dyads in this study refer to software developer pairs where each member comes from a different team. We explore the antecedents by integrating interpersonal and technology-based coordination. We test this model using data collected from 59 software developer Dyads from interacting teams as well as from software developer leaders. The results reveal that the implicit knowledge sharing has a significant positive impact on coordination effectiveness. The use of explicit knowledge sharing and coordination technology have no statistically significant impact on coordination effectiveness although the teams studied were working predominantly in a collocated mode. Mutual trust and project commitment have a significant impact on knowledge sharing with mutual trust directly affecting both implicit and explicit knowledge sharing.

The key to solving this problem is to achieve automatic text classification of health questions. This paper considered a feature fusion model for the classification of Chinese short texts on medical health Q&A websites by combining the text features and topic features. Firstly, we generated the text word vector by word embedding method and obtained the text features under Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model. Given the difficulty in determination of topic numbers, we conducted a sub-sample experiment to obtain the few optimal topic numbers under which the classification performances were good. Then we extracted the topic features and used the one-dimensional convolution idea of the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for topic feature filtering. Finally, we combined the two features together subtly for text classification. Two experiments were conducted to illustrate our model in terms of recall rate, precision, and F1 value when the datasets were from different online medical Q&A websites.

These sensors can collectively monitor a diverse range of human activities and the surrounding environment. Crowdsensing is a new paradigm which takes advantage of the pervasive smartphones to sense, collect, and analyze data beyond the scale of what was previously possible. With the crowdsensing system, a crowdsourcer can recruit smartphone users to provide sensing service. Existing crowdsensing applications and systems lack good incentive mechanisms that can attract more user participation. To address this issue, we design incentive mechanisms for crowdsensing. We consider two system models: the crowdsourcer-centric model where the crowdsourcer provides a reward shared by participating users, and the user-centric model where users have more control over the payment they will receive. For the crowdsourcer-centric model, we design an incentive mechanism using a Stackelberg game, where the crowdsourcer is the leader while the users are the followers. We show how to compute the unique Stackelberg Equilibrium, at which the utility of the crowdsourcer is maximized, and none of the users can improve its utility by unilaterally deviating from its current strategy. For the user-centric model, we design an auction-based incentive mechanism, which is computationally efficient, individually rational, profitable, and truthful. Through extensive simulations, we evaluate the performance and validate the theoretical properties of our incentive mechanisms.","1558-2566","","10.1109/TNET.2015.2421897","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7101300","Crowdsensing;crowdsourcing;incentive mechanism;Stackelberg game","Sensors;Games;Smart phones;Computational modeling;Crowdsourcing;IEEE transactions;Mechanical factors","","354","","52","IEEE","4 May 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Most radio-based solutions require a process of site survey, in which radio signatures of an interested area are annotated with their real recorded locations. Site survey involves intensive costs on manpower and time, limiting the applicable buildings of wireless localization worldwide. In this study, we investigate novel sensors integrated in modern mobile phones and leverage user motions to construct the radio map of a floor plan, which is previously obtained only by site survey. Considering user movements in a building, originally separated RSS fingerprints are geographically connected by user moving paths of locations where they are recorded, and they consequently form a high dimension fingerprint space, in which the distances among fingerprints are preserved. The fingerprint space is then automatically mapped to the floor plan in a stress-free form, which results in fingerprints labeled with physical locations. On this basis, we design LiFS, an indoor localization system based on off-the-shelf WiFi infrastructure and mobile phones. LiFS is deployed in an office building covering over 1,600  m $^2$ , and its deployment is easy and rapid since little human intervention is needed. In LiFS, the calibration of fingerprints is crowdsourced and automatic.

The developed approach supports seamless P2P energy trading between individual prosumers and/or the utility. The presented operational model can also be used to operate islanded microgrids. The CES framework and the operation algorithm are then prototyped through an efficient blockchain implementation, namely, the IBM Hyperledger Fabric. This implementation allows the system operator to manage the network users to seamlessly trade energy.

Yet the low participation level of smartphone users due to various resource consumptions, such as time and power, remains a hurdle that prevents the enjoyment brought by sensing applications. Recently, some researchers have done pioneer works in motivating users to contribute their resources by designing incentive mechanisms, which are able to provide certain rewards for participation. However, none of these works considered smartphone users’ nature of opportunistically occurring in the area of interest. Specifically, for a general smartphone sensing application, the platform would distribute tasks to each user on her arrival and has to make an immediate decision according to the user’s reply. To accommodate this general setting, we design three online incentive mechanisms, named TBA, TOIM and TOIM-AD, based on online reverse auction. TBA is designed to pursue platform utility maximization, while TOIM and TOIM-AD achieve the crucial property of truthfulness. All mechanisms possess the desired properties of computational efficiency, individual rationality, and profitability. Besides, they are highly competitive compared to the optimal offline solution. The extensive simulation results reveal the impact of the key parameters and show good approximation to the state-of-the-art offline mechanism.","1558-2183","","10.1109/TPDS.2013.2297112","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6714605","Crowdsourcing;incentive mechanism;mobile sensing","Sensors;Smart phones;Mechanical factors;Mobile communication;Educational institutions;Electronic mail","","185","","37","IEEE","16 Jan 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

On the contrary, we focus on a more realistic scenario where users arrive one by one online in a random order. Based on the online auction model, we investigate the problem that users submit their private types to the crowdsourcer when arriving, and the crowdsourcer aims at selecting a subset of users before a specified deadline for maximizing the value of services (assumed to be a nonnegative monotone submodular function) provided by selected users under a budget constraint.

Although the ciphertext-policy attribute-based keyword search technology combining attribute-based encryption with searchable encryption has become a hot research topic, it just deals with equivalent attributes rather than more practical attribute comparisons, like “greater than” or “less than.” In this paper, we devise a practical cryptographic primitive called attribute-based multi-keyword search scheme to support comparable attributes through utilizing 0-encoding and 1-encoding.

Crowd sourcing-based localization has been proven to be effective for mass-market location-based IoT applications. This paper proposes an enhanced crowd sourcing-based localization method by integrating inertial, wireless, and magnetic sensors. Both wireless and magnetic fingerprinting accuracy are predicted in real time through the introduction of fingerprinting accuracy indicators (FAIs) from three levels (i.e., signal, geometry, and database). The advantages and limitations of these FAI factors and their performances on predicting location errors and outliers are investigated. Furthermore, the FAI-enhanced extended Kalman filter (EKF) is proposed, which improved the dead-reckoning (DR)/WiFi, DR/Magnetic, and DR/WiFi/Magnetic integrated localization accuracy by 30.2%, 19.4%, and 29.0%, and reduced the maximum location errors by 41.2%, 28.4%, and 44.2%, respectively.

In addition, the planning algorithm should allow for negative energy costs in the road network due to regenerative braking, which is a unique feature of FEVs. In this paper, we propose a framework for energy-driven and context-aware route planning for FEVs. It has two novel aspects: 1) It is context aware, i.e., the framework has access to real-time traffic data for routing cost estimation; and it is energy driven, i.e., both time and energy efficiency are accounted for; which implies a biobjective nature of the optimization. In addition, in the case of insufficient energy on board, an optimal detour via recharge points is computed. Our main contributions to address these issues can be highlighted as follows: A vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication protocol is proposed to realize the context awareness, and we replace the original biobjective form of optimality with two single-objective forms and propose a constrained A* ( CA*) algorithm to find the solutions. The algorithm maintains a Pareto front while it confines its search by energy constraints. The best recharging detour can be also found using the algorithm. We first compared the performance of the CA* algorithm with other algorithms. We then evaluate the impact of the context awareness on road traffic by simulations using a realistic road network regarding different forms of optimality. Finally, we show that the CA* algorithm can effectively produce optimal recharging detours.","1558-0016","","10.1109/TITS.2013.2261064","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6516898","Advanced driver-assistance system (ADAS);fully electric vehicle (FEV);route optimization","Vehicles;Roads;Cost function;Batteries;Planning;Real-time systems","","84","","44","IEEE","16 May 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, we propose a novel approach that leverages the power of users to perform the detection task. We design incentive mechanisms to encourage the participation of users under two scenarios: 1) full information and 2) partial information. In full information scenario, we design a specific incentive scheme for users according to their preferences, which can provide the desirable detection result and minimize overall cost. In partial information scenario, assuming that we only have statistical information about users, we first transform the incentive mechanism design to an optimization problem, and then design the optimal incentive scheme under different system parameters by solving the optimization problem.

The system incorporates an unsupervised learning algorithm into an incremental and adaptive calibration process. The unsupervised learning algorithm constructs an initial radio map, using fingerprints collected from unknown locations, by finding a hidden structure among them. Once a positioning service is available based on the initial radio map, the radio map continues to adapt to signal changes in the environment through the incremental and adaptive calibration process using the fingerprints that are continuously collected from the service users. Experiments carried out in an office building have shown that the proposed system could successfully construct and maintain a precise radio map without requiring any location information. In a long-term experiment that lasted for five months, the proposed system was able to not just maintain but also improve the quality of the radio map.

However, the rich location data is large in quantity and privacy sensitive, which may lead to high network cost (i.e., data transmission cost, data storage cost) and potential privacy leakage for data transmission to the central server. Therefore, a decentralized indoor localization method incorporating CRNP and federated learning is devised, which keeps the location data on local users' devices and improves the shared CRNP model by aggregating users' updates of the model.

A particularly great influence of technology on learning came with the emergence of the web and adaptive educational hypermedia systems. While the web enables users to interact and collaborate with each other to create, organize, and share knowledge via user-generated content, majority of e-learning systems do not utilize the power of their users to create high quality educational content and provide data for adaptive algorithms. In this paper, we introduce a novel social learning framework that allows anybody to author educational content in a form of mini-lessons, learn lessons by following adaptive learning pathways as well as interact with their peers as in any social network. The proposed approach combines concepts of crowd-sourcing, online social networks, and complex adaptive systems to engage users in efficient learning through teaching process. We first describe the main idea behind the framework and how users interact with it, and then we describe SALT system that implements the framework. We also performed evaluation of the SALT system via several classroom studies. Our results show that collective learning experiences can be efficiently utilized in adaptive social learning. We found that students tend to form stable clusters that survive very high similarity threshold. Meanwhile, our learning pathway analysis showed that almost all students have their own unique best pathway. Experiments with various recommendation algorithms showed that most algorithms obtain very small penalty in all classes.","1939-1382","","10.1109/TLT.2016.2515097","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7373654","Crowdsourcing;collective intelligence;peer production;social network;complex adaptive system;recommender system","Adaptation models;Social network services;Crowdsourcing;Adaptive systems;Electronic learning","","33","","75","IEEE","6 Jan 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We attempt to answer such questions through mining a large set of crowdsourced gameplay data of a clone of the classic platform game Super Mario Bros (SMB). The data consist of 40 short game levels that differ along six key level design parameters. Collectively, these levels are played 1560 times over the Internet, and the perceived experience is annotated by experiment participants via self-reported ranking (pairwise preferences). Given the wealth of this crowdsourced data, as all details about players' in-game behavior are logged, the problem becomes one of extracting meaningful numerical features at the appropriate level of abstraction for the construction of generic computational models of player experience and, thereby, game aesthetics. We explore dissimilar types of features, including direct measurements of event and item frequencies, and features constructed through frequent sequence mining, and go through an in-depth analysis of the interrelationship between level content, players' behavioral patterns, and reported experience. Furthermore, the fusion of the extracted features allows us to predict reported player experience with a high accuracy, even from short game segments. In addition to advancing our insight on the factors that contribute to platform game aesthetics, the results are useful for the personalization of game experience via automatic game adaptation.","1943-0698","","10.1109/TCIAIG.2012.2231413","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6373713","Computational aesthetics;experience-driven procedural content generation;player experience modeling","Games;Feature extraction;Data mining;Data models;Prediction algorithms;Predictive models;Adaptation models","","29","","37","IEEE","3 Dec 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, choosing what data to collect in the first place requires human intuition or experience, usually supplied by a domain expert. This paper describes a new approach to machine science which demonstrates for the first time that nondomain experts can collectively formulate features and provide values for those features such that they are predictive of some behavioral outcome of interest. This was accomplished by building a Web platform in which human groups interact to both respond to questions likely to help predict a behavioral outcome and pose new questions to their peers. This results in a dynamically growing online survey, but the result of this cooperative behavior also leads to models that can predict the user's outcomes based on their responses to the user-generated survey questions. Here, we describe two Web-based experiments that instantiate this approach: The first site led to models that can predict users' monthly electric energy consumption, and the other led to models that can predict users' body mass index. As exponential increases in content are often observed in successful online collaborative communities, the proposed methodology may, in the future, lead to similar exponential rises in discovery and insight into the causal factors of behavioral outcomes.","2168-2232","","10.1109/TSMCA.2012.2195168","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6202707","Crowdsourcing;human behavior modeling;machine science;social media;surveys","Predictive models;Humans;Electricity;Data models;Web sites;Energy consumption;Water heating","","24","","51","IEEE","18 May 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Strong information protection can be a competitive advantage, but preserving privacy is a real challenge when people use the mobile apps in the smartphone. If they are too lax with privacy preserving, important or sensitive information could be lost. If they are too tight with privacy, making users jump through endless hoops to access the data they need to get their work done, productivity can nosedive. Thus, striking a balance between privacy and usability in mobile applications can be difficult. Leveraging the privacy permission settings in mobile operating systems, our basic idea to address this issue is to provide proper recommendations about the settings so that the users can preserve their sensitive information and maintain the usability of apps. In this paper, we propose an unobtrusive recommendation system to implement this idea, which can crowdsource users' privacy permission settings and generate the recommendations for them accordingly. Besides, our system allows users to provide feedback to revise the recommendations for getting better performance and adapting different scenarios. For the evaluation, we collected users' preferences from 382 participants on Amazon Technical Turks and released our system to users in the real world for 10 days. According to the study, our system can make appropriate recommendations which can meet participants' privacy expectation and mobile apps' usability.","1939-1374","","10.1109/TSC.2016.2605089","HK RGC GRF(grant numbers:PolyU152244/15E,14217816); NSFC Key Project(grant numbers:61332004); NSFC(grant numbers:61572415,61502312); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7558179","Mobile privacy;crowdsourcing;permission;recommendation","Privacy;Mobile communication;Usability;Data privacy;Collaboration;Androids;Humanoid robots","","22","","40","IEEE","1 Sep 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The objects (logical locations) appearing in the images are identified using manually or automatically generated tags. The system is context-aware and it intelligently associates user location coordinates with several smartphone contexts, like acceleration and orientation. CP360 can significantly reduce GPS positional errors for even cheap low-end smartphones and can identify the user surroundings very efficiently. We extensively tested the system in both indoor and outdoor environments of IIT Roorkee campus using Android smartphones over a dataset of more than 6,000 crowd-sourced images of nearly 70 objects (departments, hostels, cafeteria, etc.) and CP360 generates the panoramic map with an average accuracy of 92.2 percent.","1558-2183","","10.1109/TPDS.2014.2345067","MHRD; FIG(grant numbers:100579-ECD); DST(grant numbers:SB/FTP/ETA-23/2013); HK RGC(grant numbers:A-PolyU519/12); NSF(grant numbers:61332004); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6871426","Context-aware;crowd-sourcing;smartphone sensing;location-based services","Global Positioning System;Servers;Accuracy;Data collection;Context;Compass;Fingerprint recognition","","22","","22","IEEE","5 Aug 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To minimize the data collection cost and to guarantee the quality of service (QoS) of tasks are two vital issue in such mobile robot system. Data collection platform and data reporter often needs to negotiate with each other before start of data collection which will generate a certain cost. Once the platform and the data reporter agree to the cooperation, data reporter will collect and report data for a period. However, in previous researches, it was often considered that data reporters can report data at any time without considering the cost of interaction and negotiation, which is not suitable for the practice. In this paper, we propose an efficiency cost data collection scheme (ECDCS) in which the data reporter is selected according to the contribution that all the data it collects have on the whole system rather than a single data samples. Because there exists correlation in data, matrix completion technology can be adopted to recover the missing data samples with partial data while guarantee the QoS of the task. So, a data reporter selection scheme ECDCS based on the matrix completion technology is proposed in which the selection is in terms of the cooperation effect of the reporters rather than a single data sample. The main goal is to select the reporter set with low cost and high QoS which has the best cooperative effect. By doing so, in the proposed data collection scheme, the missing of partial data can be tolerated which can reduce data collection cost while guarantee the QoS. The extensive experiments results indicate that the proposed scheme can effectively reduce the data cost while maintain the QoS of application.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2868250","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61772554); Zhejiang University(grant numbers:ICT1800391); National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program)(grant numbers:2014CB046345); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8453775","Mobile crowdsourcing;data collection;matrix completion technique;low cost;data samples","Data collection;Quality of service;Task analysis;Robot sensing systems;Redundancy;Mobile handsets;Birds","","21","","52","OAPA","2 Sep 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, existing DP mechanisms for streaming data publication are not suitable for truth discovery as they fail to consider the different reliabilities of individuals, while the DP-based approaches for truth discovery are not suitable for streaming data because they ignore the correlations between truths over time. Directly applying these existing methods to streaming crowdsourced data would lead to low accuracy of the discovered truth. To solve this problem, in this paper, we propose an edge computing based privacy-preserving truth discovery mechanism, named PrivSTD, for streaming crowdsourced data to realize high accuracy of discovered truth while protecting the privacy of workers. Specifically, edge servers are introduced between the untrusted cloud server and workers to securely calculate the local truths and workers’ reliabilities. A truth-dependent budget recycle mechanism is proposed for each edge server to adaptively determine the perturbed timestamp and allocate the privacy budget according to the changing pattern of local truths. Besides, a reliability-based perturbation mechanism is proposed to reduce the perturbation magnitude on the basis of worker's reliability. We theoretical analyze the data utility and computation cost of PrivSTD, and prove that PrivSTD can satisfy $w$w-event ($\epsilon,\delta$ε,δ)-differential privacy. Extensive experimental results on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that PrivSTD achieves better utility than the state-of-the-art approaches.","1558-0660","","10.1109/TMC.2021.3062775","National Key R&D Program of China(grant numbers:2019YFA0706403); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62072472,61702562,U19A2067,U20A20182,61872274); Natural Science Foundation of Hainan Province(grant numbers:2020JJ2050); Higher Education Discipline Innovation Project(grant numbers:B18059); Young Elite Scientists Sponsorship Program(grant numbers:2018QNRC001); Young Talents Plan of Hunan Province of China(grant numbers:2019RS2001); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9366399","Crowdsourcing;truth discovery;streaming data;differential privacy;edge computing","Reliability;Task analysis;Servers;Privacy;Perturbation methods;Crowdsourcing;Mobile computing","","21","","41","IEEE","1 Mar 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
