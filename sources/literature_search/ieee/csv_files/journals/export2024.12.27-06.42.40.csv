To facilitate these scenarios, in this paper, we propose a novel efficient network management framework for participatory crowdsourcing. Specifically, we first formulate the optimization problem and propose a closed-form optimal solution to meet the quality-of-information (QoI) requirements of the task while minimizing the energy consumption variance among participants. We then largely extend the traditional framework of Gur Game for distributed decision making to recommend different levels of information contribution for each participant by merging multiple automaton chains into a single chain with multiple steady states. By modeling the user bidding behaviors, we propose a few incentive-based participant selection schemes to maximize the platform's benefits and meet participants' expectations.

A group of medical professionals remote access patient data stored at the medical server database. Smart home users want to remote real-time access information of smart devices at home. All these operations need via wireless remote communication, which is suffering from various kinds of threat and attacks. Hence, there are a large number of multi-factor remote authentication and key agreement schemes designed for the application of crowdsourcing IoT. However, in most existing related multi-factor schemes, all factors for identity authentication only act as a parameter for encrypting the local secret key. In this paper, we propose a new secure remote multi-factor authentication scheme that includes three factors: 1) user identity; 2) password; and 3) user biometrics, which are authenticated by the remote server, act as a part of the secret key and participate in the key agreement process. We choose the chaotic map since it has a smaller key size and lower computational overhead, and then achieve remote multi-factor authentication and key agreement by artfully employ it to zero-knowledge technology and the fuzzy extractor technology. Our scheme is more secure and robust since the user revealing nothing sensitive information, and the adversary cannot impersonate any user even if he gets the server's master key. We have done security proof for our proposed scheme using the Random-Or-Real(ROR) model, Burrows-Abadi-Needham (BAN) logic, and ProVerif 2.00 to show that the presented scheme is secure. Also, we give an additional security analysis for other various attacks.

Lack of context information may harm the users' confidence in the application rendering it useless. Thus, mobile devices need to be constantly aware of the environment and to test the performance of each cloud provider, which is inefficient and wastes energy. Crowdsourcing is a considerable technology to discover and select cloud services in order to provide intelligent, efficient, and stable discovering of services for mobile users based on group choice. This article introduces a crowdsourcing-based QoS supported mobile cloud service framework that fulfills mobile users' satisfaction by sensing their context information and providing appropriate services to each of the users.

Edge computing can be calculated at the edge of network so that greatly improve the efficiency and real-time performance of data processing. In addition, most of the existing privacy protection technologies are based on the trusted third parties. Therefore, in view of the semi-trustworthiness of edge servers and the transparency of blockchain, this paper proposes a triple real-time trajectory privacy protection mechanism (T-LGEB) based on edge computing and blockchain. Through combining the localized differential privacy and multiple probability extension mechanism, the T-LGEB mechanism is proposed to send the requests and data to the edge server in this paper. Then, through the spatio-temporal dynamic pseudonym mechanism proposed in the paper, the entire trajectory of task participants is divided into multiple unrelated trajectory segments with different pseudonymous identities in order to protect the trajectory privacy of task participants while ensuring high data availability and real-time data. Through a large number of experiments and comparative analysis on multiple real data sets, the proposed T-LGEB has extremely high privacy protection capabilities and data availability, and the resource consumption caused is relatively low.","1558-0660","","10.1109/TMC.2022.3187047","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62073201,62072392,62172351); Youth Innovation Science and Technology Support Program of Shandong Provincial(grant numbers:2021KJ080); Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province(grant numbers:ZR2020KF019); Major Scientific and Technological Innovation Projects of Shandong Province(grant numbers:2019JZZY020131); Yantai Science and Technology Innovation Development Plan(grant numbers:2021YT06000645); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9809921","Blockchain;edge computing;localized differential privacy;mobile crowdsourcing;trajectory privacy","Task analysis;Trajectory;Privacy;Blockchains;Edge computing;Real-time systems;Crowdsourcing","","33","","67","IEEE","28 Jun 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A foundational research of spatial crowdsourcing is to allocate micro-tasks to suitable crowd workers. Many existing studies focus on the offline scenario, where all the spatiotemporal information of micro-tasks and crowd workers is given. In this paper, we focus on the online scenario and identify a more practical micro-task allocation problem, called the Global Online Micro-task Allocation in spatial crowdsourcing (GOMA) problem. We first extend the state-of-the-art algorithm for the online maximum weighted bipartite matching problem to the GOMA problem as the baseline algorithm. Although the baseline algorithm provides a theoretical guarantee for the worst case, its average performance in practice is not good enough since the worst case happens with a very low probability in the real world. Thus, we consider the average performance of online algorithms, a.k.a. random order model. We propose a two-phase-based framework, based on which we present the TGOA algorithm with a $\frac{1}{4}$14-competitive ratio under the random order model. To improve its efficiency, we further design the TGOA-Greedy and TGOA-OP algorithm following this framework, which runs faster than the TGOA algorithm with a competitive ratio of $\frac{1}{8}$18 and $\frac{1}{4}$14, respectively. We also revisit the average performance of Greedy, which has long been considered as the worst due to its unbounded competitive ratio in the worst case. Finally, we verify the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed methods through extensive experiments on synthetic and real datasets.","1558-2191","","10.1109/TKDE.2019.2948863","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2018AAA0101100); National Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61822201,U1811463,71531001); Didi Gaia Collborative Research Funds for Young Scholars; Hong Kong RGC GRF(grant numbers:16207617); National Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61729201); Science and Technology Planning Project of Guangdong Province(grant numbers:2015B010110006); Hong Kong ITC ITF(grant numbers:ITS/391/15FX,ITS/470/18FX); Didi-HKUST joint research lab project; Microsoft Research Asia; Wechat Research; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8897719","Spatial crowdsourcing;task assignment;online bipartite matching","Task analysis;Crowdsourcing;Resource management;Analytical models;Real-time systems;Greedy algorithms;Spatiotemporal phenomena","","33","","51","IEEE","13 Nov 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Similar to other SC applications, location privacy is of great concern to vehicle workers as they are required to disclose their own location to servers to facilitate the service utilities. Traditional location privacy protection mechanisms cannot be applied to vehicle-based SC since they assume workers’ mobility on a 2-dimensional plane without considering the network-constrained mobility features of vehicles. Accordingly, in this paper, we aim at addressing issues related to Vehicle-based spatial crowdsourcing Location Privacy (VLP) over road networks. Our objective is to design a location obfuscation strategy to minimize the quality loss due to obfuscation with geo-indistinguishability satisfied. Considering the computational complexity of VLP, by resorting to discretization, we first approximate VLP to a linear programming problem that can be solved by well-developed approaches. To further improve the time-efficiency, we conduct constraint reduction for VLP by exploiting key features of geo-indistinguishability in road networks and problem decomposition based on VLP’s constraint structure. Finally, we carry out both trace-driven simulation and real-world experiments, where our experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our approach over a known state-of-the-art location obfuscation strategy in terms of both quality-of-service and privacy.","1558-0660","","10.1109/TMC.2020.3037911","National Science Foundation(grant numbers:NSF-2029881,NSF-2029976); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9259240","Spatial crowdsourcing;geo-indistinguishability;location privacy;location obfuscation","Task analysis;Roads;Privacy;Servers;Crowdsourcing;Distortion;Two dimensional displays","","32","","56","IEEE","13 Nov 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, we design a movement-based incentive mechanism for crowdsourcing, where participants are stimulated to move to the unpopular areas and complete the sensing tasks in these areas, which benefits both participants and the platform. We formulate a task allocation problem considering controlled mobility. Since the task allocation problem is NP-hard, we propose a greedy algorithm to solve it and design a critical payment policy to guarantee that participants declare their cost truthfully.

This article formalizes the LMAP for fresh produce via the group role assignment framework and proposes a role awareness method by using adaptive clustering in spatiotemporal crowdsourcing based on task granularity. The formalization of LMAP makes it easy to find a solution using the IBM ILOG CPLEX optimization package (CPLEX). The proposed method allows one to take the time and space factor into consideration, helps spatiotemporal crowdsourcing assign couriers for efficient delivering daily orders, and improves the quality of service in last-mile logistics.

MCS requires an appropriate task assignment strategy, since different workers may have different performance in terms of acceptance rate and quality. Task assignment is challenging, since a worker's performance 1) may fluctuate, depending on both the worker's current personal context and the task context and 2) is not known a priori, but has to be learned over time. Moreover, learning context-specific worker performance requires access to context information, which may not be available at a central entity due to communication overhead or privacy concerns. In addition, evaluating worker performance might require costly quality assessments. In this paper, we propose a context-aware hierarchical online learning algorithm addressing the problem of performance maximization in MCS. In our algorithm, a local controller (LC) in the mobile device of a worker regularly observes the worker's context, her/his decisions to accept or decline tasks and the quality in completing tasks. Based on these observations, the LC regularly estimates the worker's context-specific performance. The mobile crowdsourcing platform (MCSP) then selects workers based on performance estimates received from the LCs. This hierarchical approach enables the LCs to learn context-specific worker performance and it enables the MCSP to select suitable workers. In addition, our algorithm preserves worker context locally, and it keeps the number of required quality assessments low. We prove that our algorithm converges to the optimal task assignment strategy. Moreover, the algorithm outperforms simpler task assignment strategies in experiments based on synthetic and real data.","1558-2566","","10.1109/TNET.2018.2828415","German Research Foundation (DFG) within the Collaborative Research Center 1053–MAKI(grant numbers:B3); Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey under 3501 Program(grant numbers:116E229); ONR Mathematical Data Sciences Grant; NSF(grant numbers:1524417,1462245); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8353505","Crowdsourcing;task assignment;online learning;contextual multi-armed bandits","Task analysis;Crowdsourcing;Performance evaluation;Quality assessment;Mobile handsets;Privacy;IEEE transactions","","29","","40","IEEE","2 May 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This paper presents a novel contract-based incentive framework to incentivize such a Wi-Fi network crowdsourcing under incomplete information (where each user has certain private information such as mobility pattern and Wi-Fi access quality). In the proposed framework, the network operator designs and offers a set of contract items to users, each consisting of a Wi-Fi access price (that a user can charge others for accessing his AP) and a subscription fee (that a user needs to pay the operator for joining the community). Different from the existing contracts in the literature, in our contract model, each user's best choice depends not only on his private information but also on other user's choices. This greatly complicates the contract design, as the operator needs to analyze the equilibrium choices of all users, rather than the best choice of each single user. We first derive the feasible contract that guarantees the user's truthful information disclosure based on the equilibrium analysis of the user choice, and then derive the optimal (and feasible) contract that yields a maximal profit for the operator. Our analysis shows that a user who provides a higher Wi-Fi access quality is more likely to choose a higher Wi-Fi access price and subscription fee, regardless of the user mobility pattern. Simulation results further show that when increasing the average Wi-Fi access quality of users, the operator can gain more profit, but (counter-intuitively) offer lower Wi-Fi access prices and subscription fees for users.","1558-2566","","10.1109/TNET.2018.2812785","General Research Funds through the University Grant Committee of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China(grant numbers:CUHK 14206315,CUHK 14219016); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61771162,11631013,11688101); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8350371","Wi-Fi crowdsourcing;wireless community networks;incentive mechanism;contract theory","Wireless fidelity;Contracts;Wireless communication;Crowdsourcing;Pricing;Communication system security;IEEE transactions","","27","","40","IEEE","26 Apr 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Current systems focus on improving indoor localization accuracy and must be combined with an accurate labeled floor plan to provide usable indoor navigation services. Such labeled floor plans are often unavailable or involve a prohibitive cost to manually obtain. In this paper, we present IndoorWaze, a novel crowdsourcing-based context-aware indoor navigation system that can automatically generate an accurate context-aware floor plan with labeled indoor POIs for the first time in literature. IndoorWaze combines the Wi-Fi fingerprints of indoor walkers with the Wi-Fi fingerprints and POI labels provided by POI employees to produce a high-fidelity labeled floor plan.

In the mean time, $\mathbb {CAP}$CAP-related models and frameworks based on different research hypotheses are rapidly emerging, and they usually address specific issues from a certain perspective. Due to different settings and conditions, different models are not compatible with each other. However, $\mathbb {CAP}$CAP urgently needs to combine these techniques to form a unified framework. In addition, these models needs to be learned and updated online with the extension of crowdsourced data and task types; thus, requiring a unified architecture that integrates lifelong learning concepts and breaks down the barriers between different modules. This paper draws on the idea of ubiquitous operating systems and proposes a novel OS (CrowdOS), which is an abstract software layer running between native OS and application layer. In particular, based on an in-depth analysis of the complex crowd environment and diverse characteristics of heterogeneous tasks, we construct the OS kernel and three core frameworks including task resolution and assignment framework (TRAF), integrated resource management (IRM), and task result quality optimization (TRO). In addition, we validate the usability of CrowdOS, module correctness and development efficiency.

A central process in crowdsourcing is task assignment, the mechanism through which workers find tasks. On popular platforms such as Amazon Mechanical Turk, task assignment is facilitated by the ability to sort tasks by dimensions such as creation date or reward amount. Task composition improves task assignment by producing for each worker, a personalized summary of tasks, referred to as a Composite Task (CT). We propose different ways of producing CTs and formulate an optimization problem that finds for a worker, the most relevant and diverse CTs. We show empirically that workers' experience is greatly improved due to personalization that enforces an adequation of CTs with workers' skills and preferences. We also study and formalize various ways of diversifying tasks in each CT. Task diversity is grounded in organization studies that have shown its impact on worker motivation [33]. Our experiments show that diverse CTs contribute to improving outcome quality. More specifically, we show that while task throughput and worker retention are best with ranked lists, crowdwork quality reaches its best with CTs diversified by requesters, thereby confirming that workers look to expose their “good” work to many requesters.","1558-2191","","10.1109/TKDE.2017.2755660","This work was partially funded(grant numbers:ANR-13-CORD-0020); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8048549","Crowdsourcing;task assignment;task composition;task diversity","Throughput;Crowdsourcing;Optimization;Urban areas;Clustering algorithms;Buildings","","24","","58","IEEE","22 Sep 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this article, we investigate two different CMCS recruitment strategies allowing task requesters to form teams of socially connected and skilled workers: 1) a platform-based strategy where the platform exploits its own knowledge about the workers to form a team and 2) a leader-based strategy where the platform designates a group leader that recruits its own suitable team given its own knowledge about its social network (SN) neighbors. We first formulate the recruitment as an integer linear program (ILP) that optimally forms teams according to four fuzzy-logic-based criteria: 1) level of expertise; 2) social relationship strength; 3) recruitment cost; and 4) recruiter’s confidence level. To cope with NP-hardness, we design a novel low-complexity CMCS recruitment approach relying on graph neural networks (GNNs), specifically graph embedding and clustering techniques, to shrink the workers’ search space and afterwards, exploiting a metaheuristic genetic algorithm to select appropriate workers. Simulation results applied on a real-world data set illustrate the performance of both proposed CMCS recruitment approaches. It is shown that our proposed low-complexity GNN-based recruitment algorithm achieves close performances to those of the baseline ILP with significant computational time saving and ability to operate on large-scale mobile crowdsourcing platforms. It is also shown that compared to the leader-based strategy, the platform-based strategy recruits a more skilled team but with lower SN relationships and higher cost.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2021.3086410","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9446513","Crowdsourcing;embedding;graph neural network (GNN);Internet of Things (IoT);recruitment","Task analysis;Recruitment;Crowdsourcing;Resource management;Social networking (online);Genetic algorithms;Simulation","","22","","60","IEEE","3 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Herein, we present a novel game-theoretic mechanism to incentivize the competitive and selfish workers to provide high-quality solutions in the MCS.

In view of the stochastic nature of traffic conditions, we derive a tractable expression for the probability distribution of task delay based on a discrete-time traffic model. By leveraging reverse auction framework, we model the utility of a service requester as a function in terms of uncertain task delay and incurred payment. To maximize the requester’s utility under a budget constraint, we cast the mechanism design as a non-monotone submodular maximization problem over a knapsack constraint. Based on this formulation, we develop a truthful budgeted utility maximization auction (TBUMA), which is truthful, budget feasible, profitable, individually rational and computationally efficient.

In this article, we propose GAIMMO, a novel grade-driven auction-based incentive mechanism for BCS with multiple objectives in mind: crowdsourcer utility maximization, social welfare maximization, social grade maximization, and social cost minimization. Concretely, we propose a grade-based task sorting (GTS) algorithm to determine the service priority of heterogeneous crowdsourcers in order to motivate their cooperative behaviors, which consequently maximizes crowdsourcer utility when combining with the carefully designed utility functions of other system entities. We propose a grade-based utility function of workers and employ a hierarchical premium-based task assignment (PTA) algorithm to realize social welfare maximization, social grade maximization, and social cost minimization. We further propose a fixed-grade-sum and grade-based reward-sharing (FGSGRS) method to encourage fast block generation and motivate high-grade miners without damaging the profits of the crowdsourcers.

To provide location-based services with Tack, an event organizer only needs to bring and place a small number of (reusable) beacons around the venue before the event begins. As a system framework, Tack uses a combination of known beacon locations, contacts over bluetooth low energy, crowdsourcing, and dead-reckoning to estimate and refine user locations. To make our location estimates more accurate, we embrace the inherent nature of beacons, design crowdsourcing-based inference algorithms, and present an extensive evaluation by running real-world experiments with iOS devices and beacons.

To effectively assign MCS tasks, many research efforts have been made in the literature. However, most prior schemes mainly optimize certain performance metrics in the assignment, yet overlooking other metrics, which thus cannot guarantee the overall system performance. This also limits the applicability of the proposed solution dedicated to the targeted performance metrics only. In this paper, we present UniTask, a unified task assignment design to address these issues. UniTask jointly considers the representative MCS performance metrics, including coverage, latency, and accuracy, to optimize the overall system utility. We mathematically formulate this problem and prove its NP-hardness. To efficiently schedule tasks, we also propose a utility-aware heuristic algorithm in UniTask. Moreover, a set of optimization techniques are further designed to enhance UniTask. Extensive evaluations are performed on two real-world datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that utility is an effective indicator of the system's overall performance. With an optimization on the system utility, UniTask can outperform the baseline methods on these individual performance metrics.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2019.2909296","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61802261); Shenzhen University(grant numbers:2018061); ECS Grant from Research Grants Council of Hong Kong(grant numbers:CityU21203516); China NSFC(grant numbers:61872248,U1736207); Guangdong NSF(grant numbers:2017A030312008); Shenzhen Science and Technology Foundation(grant numbers:JCYJ20170302140946299,JCYJ20170412110753954,GRCK2017082111300325); Fok Ying-Tong Education Foundation for Young Teachers in the Higher Education Institutions of China GDUPS (2015)(grant numbers:161064); Tianjin Key Laboratory of Advanced Networking (TANK); “PCL Future Regional Network Facilities for Large-scale Experiments and Applications”(grant numbers:PCL2018KP001); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8681539","Mobile crowdsourcing (MCS);task assignment;urban sensing","Task analysis;Sensors;Measurement;Crowdsourcing;Optimization;Internet of Things;Mobile handsets","","16","","46","IEEE","4 Apr 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Integration of KBs has attracted much attention as different KBs usually contain overlapping and complementary information. Automatic techniques for KB integration have been improved but far from perfect. Therefore, in this paper, we study the problem of knowledge base semantic integration using crowd intelligence. There are both classes and instances in a KB, in our work, we propose a novel hybrid framework for KB semantic integration considering the semantic heterogeneity of KB class structures. We first perform semantic integration of the class structures via crowdsourcing, then apply the blocking-based instance matching approach according to the integrated class structure. For class structure (taxonomy) semantic integration, the crowd is leveraged to help identifying the semantic relationships between classes to handle the semantic heterogeneity problem. Under the conditions of both large scale KBs and limited monetary budget for crowdsourcing, we formalize the class structure (taxonomy) semantic integration problem as a Local Tree Based Query Selection (LTQS) problem. We show that the LTQS problem is NP-hard and propose two greedy-based algorithms, i.e., static query selection and adaptive query selection. Furthermore, the KBs are usually of large scales and have millions of instances, direct pairwise-based instance matching is inefficient. Therefore, we adopt the blockingbased strategy for instance matching, taking advantage of the class structure (taxonomy) integration result. The experiments on real large scale KBs verify the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approaches.","1558-2191","","10.1109/TKDE.2017.2656086","Hong Kong RGC(grant numbers:N HKUST637/13); National Grand Fundamental Research 973 Program of China(grant numbers:2014CB340303); National Science Foundation of China (NSFC)(grant numbers:61502021,61328202,61532004); NSFC(grant numbers:U1301253); Microsoft Research Asia Fellowship; Shandong Province Higher Education Institutions; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7828140","Knowledge base;crowdsourcing;data integration","Taxonomy;Semantics;Knowledge based systems;Ontologies;Crowdsourcing;Data integration;Computer science","","15","","44","IEEE","20 Jan 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To ensure the efficiency in vehicle-based visual crowdsourcing, there remain at least two technical challenges. First, to maximize the Quality of Information (QoI), which measures the amount of information extracted from the collected data, the context of data collection (e.g., camera position and orientation) must be taken into account in the process of task allocation. Second, intensive data collection from dense measurement points is key to ensure timely and accurate sensing of the targets of interest, whereas there exists a trade-off between the amount and rate of data collection and the computing and communication resources required to fulfill the latency constraint. To solve these challenges, we propose gathering and processing the collected data at the edge of the network and design a context-aware task allocation scheme, called FlexSensing, to jointly optimize the QoI and processing latency. We target application scenarios where commercial vehicles are turned into vehicular fog nodes (VFNs). These nodes gather and process the visual data collected from other vehicles within their coverage areas. The key idea of FlexSensing is to determine the rate of data collection for each sensing vehicle in the targeted area and to assign processing tasks to VFNs based on the estimated QoI and the workload of the VFNs. Given the excessive computational complexity of task allocation in this context, we formulate task allocation as a Markov decision process and apply a deep Q-network (DQN) to learn the optimized task allocation strategies for increasing the QoI of collected data while reducing the processing latency. To evaluate the effectiveness of FlexSensing, we simulate the mobility of different vehicles involved in the scenario at different times of the day based on real-world traffic data collected from the city of Helsinki and select a real-time object detection application for a case study. As compared with the existing task allocation strategies, the DQN-based task allocation strategies reduce the average processing latency by up to 51% and increase the QoI of the collected data by up to 34%.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2020.3040615","European Union’s Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme(grant numbers:815191); Academy of Finland(grant numbers:317432,318937); Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) KAKENHI(grant numbers:JP18KK0279,JP20H00592,JP20K19794); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9270280","Deep Q-network (DQN);vehicle-based visual crowdsourcing;vehicular fog computing (VFC)","Task analysis;Visualization;Resource management;Crowdsourcing;Cameras;Data collection;Sensors","","14","","47","IEEE","25 Nov 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Large complex tasks may be assigned to teams directly. To ensure the rapid accomplishment of tasks, we need to assign a task to multiple teams, while a team is composed of at least one worker. On the other hand, in order to ensure the enthusiasm and income of workers, the platform allows one worker to participate in a limited number of teams. Thereby, a team may undertake multiple but limited tasks. It is obvious that task allocation needs to avoid each worker being overloaded as well as prevent information leakage, which is caused by a task assigned to different teams at the same time. Therefore, different teams being assigned to a certain task cannot include the same workers. Such a scenario forms a many-to-many (M2M) assignment problem [or group multirole assignment (GMRA)] under high-order cardinality (HC) constraints, while the platform wants to choose appropriate and excellent teams for all the tasks in a specific time window. In order to solve this problem, this article studies and formalizes the above problem by introducing HC and conflicting agents on roles (CAR) constraints to GMRA. The main contributions of this article include: 1) the first formalization of the team allocation problem (TAP) in crowdsourcing through extending GMRA and the creation of a composition matrix to express HC constraints of agents and conflict avoiding constraints; 2) theoretical proofs of the theorems of the formalized problem, such as a necessary and sufficient condition (NSC), which confines the solution space of the problem; and 3) a practice solution to the proposed problem based on the IBM ILOG CPLEX optimization package (CPLEX).

An important problem in crowdsourcing is the task recommendation problem, in which tasks that best match a particular worker's preferences and reliabilities are recommended to that worker. A task recommendation scheme that assigns tasks more likely to be accepted by a worker who is more likely to complete it reliably results in better performance for the task requester. Without prior information about a worker, his preferences and reliabilities need to be learned over time. In this article, we propose a multi-armed bandit (MAB) framework to learn a worker's preferences and his reliabilities for different categories of tasks. However, unlike the classical MAB problem, the reward from the worker's completion of a task is unobservable. We therefore include the use of gold tasks (i.e., tasks whose solutions are known a priori and which do not produce any rewards) in our task recommendation procedure. Our model could be viewed as a new variant of MAB, in which the random rewards can only be observed at those time steps where gold tasks are used, and the accuracy of estimating the expected reward of recommending a task to a worker depends on the number of gold tasks used. We show that the optimal regret is $O(\sqrt{n})$O(n), where $n$n is the number of tasks recommended to the worker. We develop three task recommendation strategies to determine the number of gold tasks for different task categories, and show that they are order optimal. Simulations verify the efficiency of our approaches.","1939-1374","","10.1109/TSC.2020.3020338","Singapore Ministry of Education Academic Research Fund Tier 2(grant numbers:MOE2018-T2-2-019); Agency for Science, Technology and Research; Advanced Manufacturing and Engineering (AME) Industry Alignment Fund – Pre Positioning(grant numbers:A19D6a0053); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9181423","Crowdsourcing;task recommendation;multi-armed bandit","Task analysis;Reliability;Crowdsourcing;Gold;Labeling;Resource management;Motion pictures","","13","","59","IEEE","31 Aug 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, such retail-style task allocation has the following problems: 1) each task is executed independently from scratch, thus the execution of one task seldom utilize the results of other tasks and the requester must pay in full for the task; 2) many workers only undertake a very small number of tasks contemporaneously, thus the workers' skills and time may not be fully utilized. We observe that many complex tasks in real-world crowdsourcing platforms have similar skill requirements and long deadlines. Based on these real-world observations, this paper presents a novel batch allocation approach for tasks with overlapping skill requirements. Requesters' real payment can be discounted because the real execution cost of tasks can be reduced due to batch allocation and execution, and each worker's real earnings may increase because he/she can undertake more tasks contemporaneously. This batch allocation optimization problem is proved to be NP-hard. Then, two types of heuristic approaches are designed: layered batch allocation and core-based batch allocation. The former approach mainly utilizes the hierarchy pattern to form all possible batches, which can achieve better performance but may require higher computational cost since all possible batches are formed and observed; the latter approach selects core tasks to form batches, which can achieve suboptimal performance with lower complexity and significantly reduce computational cost. With the theoretical analyses and experiments on a real-world Upwork dataset in which the proposed approaches are compared with the previous benchmark retail-style allocation approach, we find that our approaches have better performances in terms of total payment by requesters and average income of workers, as well as maintaining close successful task completion probability and consuming less task allocation time.","1558-2183","","10.1109/TPDS.2019.2894146","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61472079,61806053,61807008); Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province(grant numbers:BK20171363,BK20180356,BK20180369); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8620370","Task allocation;crowdsourcing;batch formation;discounting;skill overlapping","Task analysis;Resource management;Crowdsourcing;Computational efficiency;Social network services;Benchmark testing","","13","","30","IEEE","20 Jan 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, we propose a dynamic utility task allocation algorithm (DUTA), a software crowdsourcing task allocation algorithm based on the dynamic utility. First, using the attributes provided by the worker registration information, we estimate the initial value of a worker's development abilities based on the attribute weights and levels. Second, the worker's development capabilities are calculated based on his or her history of the completed tasks, including task complexity, quality, and development efficiency. The worker's record of development capability is updated dynamically. Then, based on the skill weights, we calculate the degree to which the task requirements matche the worker's skills. Finally, we take the product of the worker's development ability and the degree of skill matching as the allocation utility, and the total utility is maximized as the optimization goal. To solve the optimal match between tasks and workers, we use the Kuhn-Munkres algorithm with a weighted bipartite graph. Our experimental results showed that DUTA provided good performance in total allocation utility, with a better task allocation success rate than the algorithm based on the user reliability. The DUTA achieved an average allocation accuracy of up to 85.63%, demonstrating that it can guide task assignments effectively.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2902913","National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program)(grant numbers:2017YFB1400602,2016YFB0800401); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61572371,61702377); Science and Technology Innovation Program of Hubei Province(grant numbers:2018ACA13); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8666714","Capability measurement;Kuhn-Munkres algorithm;skill matching;software complexity;software crowdsourcing;task assignment","Task analysis;Crowdsourcing;Software;Resource management;Heuristic algorithms;Software algorithms;Complexity theory","","12","","29","OAPA","13 Mar 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, we propose a dynamic approach that exploits task-quality ontology to select the most suitable quality control mechanism (QCM) for a given task based on its type. The proposed approach has been enriched by a reputation engine that collects requesters' feedback on the performance of QCMs. Accordingly, QCMs and tasks were automatically matched using the underlying categorization structure of tasks on one side and the reputation scores of QCMs on the other side.

In this paper, we present a first study on how the workers' bounded cognitive rationality interacts with and affects the decisions and performance of a multimedia crowdsourcing system. Specifically, we consider a two-stage model, where a requester first determines the reward and the quality requirement for each task, and the workers select the tasks to accomplish accordingly. First, we consider the benchmark case where users are fully rational, and derive the requester's optimal rewards and quality requirements for the tasks. Furthermore, we focus on the more practical bounded rational case by modeling the workers' task selection behaviors using the cognitive hierarchy theory. Comparing with the fully rational benchmark, we show that the requester can increase her profit by taking advantage of the workers' bounded cognitive rationality, especially when the workers' population is large or the workers' average cognitive level is low. When the workers' average cognitive level is very high, however, the equilibrium under the practical bounded rational model converges to that under the benchmark fully rational model. It is because the workers at different levels make decisions sequentially and high cognitive level workers can accurately predict other users' strategies. Under both the fully and bounded rational models, we show that if workers are heterogeneous but one type of workers (either the high or the low quality) dominates the platform, the requester cannot make a higher profit by setting different quality requirements for different tasks.","1558-0008","","10.1109/JSAC.2019.2916448","General Research Fund CUHK from Hong Kong UGC(grant numbers:14219016); Chinese University of Hong Kong; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8713532","Multimedia crowdsourcing;bounded rationality;cognitive hierarchy theory;game theory","Task analysis;Crowdsourcing;Benchmark testing;Streaming media;Cognition;Multimedia communication","","12","","35","IEEE","13 May 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Specifically, RSS measurements are obtained and annotated with location tags while a participant is walking along a chosen path with a smartphone at hand. In the localization stage, we adopt the Gaussian Process based solution and propose a novel mean function selection method. Extensive experiments show that the path-based site survey can achieve a comparable localization performance to the point-based site survey, but takes less survey time.

Understanding gaze patterns is helpful for evaluating visualizations and user behaviors, but traditional eye-tracking studies require specialized hardware and local users. To avoid these constraints, we developed a method called Fauxvea, which crowdsources visualization tasks on the Web and estimates gaze fixations through cursor interactions without eye-tracking hardware. We ran experiments to evaluate how gaze estimates from our method compare with eye-tracking data. First, we evaluated crowdsourced estimates for three common types of information visualizations and basic visualization tasks using Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk). In another, we reproduced findings from a previous eye-tracking study on tree layouts using our method on MTurk. Results from these experiments show that fixation estimates using Fauxvea are qualitatively and quantitatively similar to eye tracking on the same stimulus-task pairs. These findings suggest that crowdsourcing visual analysis tasks with static information visualizations could be a viable alternative to traditional eye-tracking studies for visualization research and design.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2016.2532331","US National Science Foundation (NSF)(grant numbers:IIS-10-16623); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7414495","Eye tracking;crowdsourcing;focus window;information visualization;visual analysis;user studies","Data visualization;Visualization;Crowdsourcing;Gaze tracking;Presses;Hardware;Layout","Adult;Attention;Crowdsourcing;Eye Movement Measurements;Female;Fixation, Ocular;Humans;Internet;Male;Task Performance and Analysis","11","","31","IEEE","19 Feb 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We design AppWiR, a crowdsourcing-based mining system that collects app behavior information from phones and mines hundreds of indicators in different network layers. It builds a two-layer causal relationship among app behaviors, network traffics, and network resources. With such relationship knowledge, we model, quantify, and predict the network resource usage for each mobile app. We fully implement the AppWiR crowdsourcing app in Android smartphones to collect data from users. To evaluate its real-world performance, we deploy the AppWiR system and conduct a trial in a leading LTE carrier’s network in different geographic areas and network coverages.

To stimulate worker participation, many reverse auction-based incentive mechanisms have been proposed. Designing auctions that discourage workers from cheating and instead encouraging them to reveal their true cost information has drawn significant attention. However, the existing efforts have been focusing on tackling individual cheating misbehaviors, while the scenarios that workers strategically form collusion coalitions and rig their bids together to manipulate auction outcomes have received little attention. To fill this gap, in this work we develop a $(t,p)$(t,p)-collusion resistant scheme that ensures no coalition of weighted cardinality $t$t can improve its group utility by coordinating the bids at a probability of $p$p. This paper takes into account the unique features of crowdsourcing, such as diverse worker types and reputations, in the design. The proposed scheme can suppress a broad spectrum of collusion strategies. Besides, desirable properties, including $p$p-truthfulness and $p$p-individual rationality, are also achieved. To provide a comprehensive evaluation, we first analytically prove our scheme's collusion resistance and then experimentally verify our analytical conclusion using a real-world dataset. Our experimental results show that the baseline scheme, where none of the critical properties is guaranteed, costs up to 20.1 times the optimal payment in an ideal case where no collusion exists, while our final scheme is merely 4.9 times the optimal payment.","1558-0660","","10.1109/TMC.2021.3071093","National Science Foundation(grant numbers:CNS-1943509,ECCS-1849860,IIS-1838024,EEC-1801727,CNS-1950485); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9397323","Crowdsourcing;worker recruitment auctions;collusion resistance","Crowdsourcing;Task analysis;Recruitment;Resistance;Mobile handsets;Immune system;Sensors","","9","","80","IEEE","6 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Brilliant but needy students cannot complete their studies since their parents are unemployed and their countries’ economies are poor. As a result, the students’ talents are not harnessed to their full potential.

The government provides loans to students through the ministry of education. The students pay back the loan with interest when they start working. Governments have been the sole funders of student loans. The emergence of COVID-19 and the Russia-Ukraine war have resulted in a global economic crisis. Because of the global economic crisis, the government’s spending has increased. In order to help reduce the burden of government and thereby reduce spending, we intend to revolutionize the student loan program through blockchain and crowdsourcing. This work presents a blockchain-based crowdsourcing decentralized loan platform where investors will be brought on board to provide funds for students in higher education. The platform will allow students to apply for loans from investors through registered financial institutions. The students will pay back the loans with interest when they enter the workforce.

Compared to object recognition in natural images or handwriting transcription tasks, designing an engaging task and dealing with crowd behavior is challenging in our case. This challenge originates from the inherent complexity of Maya writing and an incomplete understanding of the signs and semantics in the existing catalogs.

Given a limited recruitment budget, we formulate a cumulative platform utility maximization problem (CMP) to obtain the optimal worker set. The CMP is unsolvable directly as the platform has no prior information of workers at the initial stage (also known as “cold start”) and the cost of collecting all workers' information is prohibitive. To solve the problem, we first conduct a comprehensive data analytics on two real-world vehicle traces and obtain two crucial observations: 1) trajectory of individual vehicle is highly uncertain that it is difficult to make accurate prediction and 2) the overall distribution of vehicular trajectory penetration (measured by collection quantity and coverage) has a diurnal pattern and varies with weekly periodicity. Inspired by the insights, we propose the performance transfer-based online worker selection (POSE) scheme, which works independently from trajectory prediction with two components, i.e., transfer learning-based performance estimation and online worker selection (OWS). Based on the diurnal pattern, the former component collects a short-period trajectory penetration data of vehicles for model fitting, which can output a specific numerical distribution. With the fitting model, we can identify and select vehicles with high trajectory penetration at the initial stage to cope with the “cold start” problem. Then, we map the worker selection problem into a multiarmed bandit problem and develop upper confidence bound-based approach to solve it.

It has garnered attention in collecting and processing social, environmental, and other spatio-temporal data by the contribution of individuals, communities and groups of workers in the physical world. The objective of SC is to outsource a set of spatio-temporal tasks to a set of workers, which requires the workers to be physically traveling to the tasks' locations in order to perform them, i.e., taking photos or collecting real time weather information at pre-specified location. Existing solutions require crowd workers to disclose their precise locations to untrustworthy service providers. Location updates and tracking in spatial crowdsourcing raise several privacy concerns in that malicious parties could snoop on crowd workers' whereabouts. Thus, the crowd workers' privacy could be compromised by disclosing their locations to untrusted and possibly malicious parties. This paper provides a novel framework called Dummies' Centroid (DCentroid), which aims at preserving location privacy for crowd workers in SC. The framework adapts an anonymous communication technique using a dummy based approach to generate dummy locations, i.e. decoy locations, and send their centroid points (pseudolocations) to service providers for processing. This paper theoretically analyzes the DCentroid framework and guarantees the crowd workers' privacy, while preserving the functionality of SC, such as the success rate of task assignments, worker travel distances, and system overhead. Practical experimentation on real-world datasets shows that the DCentroid framework protects the crowd workers' location privacy without affecting the various performance parameters of task assignment.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3004470","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9123385","DCentroid;location privacy;pseudolocation;spatial crowdsourcing","Task analysis;Crowdsourcing;Privacy;Servers;Performance evaluation;Computer science;Meteorology","","7","","35","CCBY","23 Jun 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, we design a precise incentive mechanism based on a Bayesian game for SC that successfully avoids the conditions limited by the Gibbard-Satterthwaite impossibility theorem. Under this mechanism, the outsourcer carries out a Bayesian game with the participants under the circumstance of incomplete information by setting a certain amount of reference information that is not visible to the participants. Participants gain far more utility by telling the truth than that of they gain by lying and thus have a stronger motivation to submit higher-quality data. In implementing this mechanism to automatically compute the actual utility of participants and integrate data results, we propose a geometric primitive matching algorithm based on the Jaccard coefficient. Through both rigorous theoretical analyses and real experiments, the incentive mechanism that we propose is incentive-compatible and can greatly improve data quality.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2894578","Ministry of Science and Technology(grant numbers:2016YFB0501504); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8624285","Spatial information;crowdsourcing;incentive mechanism;Bayesian game;Jaccard coefficient","Crowdsourcing;Games;Bayes methods;Data integrity;Task analysis;Geoscience;Sensors","","6","","63","OAPA","23 Jan 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Furthermore, as low-quality answers may degrade the accuracy of synthetic results sharply, the last issue is how to weed them out. In this paper, we present MacroWiz, a simple yet effective framework to manage crowd wisdom on MSNs. Given a crowdsourcing task, MacroWiz motivates online users to contribute their knowledge or opinions, and assists the task requester in collecting answers, selecting reliable ones, and making ultimate decisions. The platform consists of two functional units: wisdom collection and answer selection. The former estimates and gathers the minimum number of answers required to satisfy the task requirement conservatively, while the latter analyzes the accuracy, the effectiveness, and the cost of each answer, based on which it selects those with high accuracy and low cost by solving a dual-objective optimization problem. We validate the effectiveness of our platform by using MovieLens data sets, which contain over one million anonymous ratings of movies.

How to formulate a reasonable task allocation mechanism to recruit the most suitable participant for the current perceptual task, and maximize the benefits of the platform has become a problem that most researchers focus on. Great efforts have been invested on task assignment mechanisms from the perspective of the platform or requesters, i.e., quality-sensitive, budget-sensitive, time-sensitive, and location-sensitive. Especially for the location-sensitive task assignment mechanism, many studies motivate users to participate by some coverage estimation methods, i.e., minimizing the traveling distance. Most existing methods statically estimate the distance between the current location of the participant and the task destination, without giving any consideration about the movement track of the participant, which may result in the failure of task for the misallocation. In this paper, we propose a location-sensitive task assignment mechanism using predictable mobility based on Markov model for the vehicle-based crowdsourcing platform. Specially, we present a location transfer prediction model based on Markov model named Markov-TPM by analyzing the positional regularity of task participants during a period of time, to predict where the participant will appear in the next time period first. In addition, we propose a task assignment mechanism based on Markov-TPM that is helpful for the platform to select the most suitable participant to complete the task. Finally, experiments are carried out by using the data set about the taxi trajectory which is collected in Shanghai, and it is shown that the proposed algorithm can improve the accuracy of the task-delivered, which is evidently superior to two algorithms compared, i.e., random prediction algorithm and prediction algorithm based on neighbor relation.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2876908","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:41761086,61502254,61761035); Program for Young Talents of Science and Technology, Universities of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region(grant numbers:NJYT18B10); Open Funds of Key Laboratory of Symbolic Computation and Knowledge Engineering, Ministry of Education(grant numbers:93K172018K07); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8511048","Crowdsourcing;Markov;movement track;task assignment;participant","Task analysis;Crowdsourcing;Markov processes;Trajectory;Predictive models;Resource management;Prediction algorithms","","5","","27","OAPA","26 Oct 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Standardization is recognized as essential to reducing variation and, therefore, costs, as well as managing quality. Public frameworks and standards, such as ITIL® (Information Technology Infrastructure Library), provide best-practice guidance and a common vocabulary for managing IT (information technology) services. In this paper, we explore the role that social networking and “crowdsourcing” can play in socializing and developing best practices for a service delivery organization. We draw on our experience developing and deploying a social networking application, called Cyano, which is being used by approximately 13,000 IT professionals to capture and maintain day-to-day activities, processes, and artifacts used for problem and change management of several hundred outsourced infrastructures. Cyano is a new breed of social networking enterprise applications, in which crowdsourcing is leveraged to enrich and maintain IT processes and social networks are not created by explicit membership, but rather are implicitly discovered by the type of activities and infrastructure elements that various users support. In this paper, we focus on 1) the architecture of Cyano for supporting social tagging and linkage across different layers of management applications, 2) process customization and governance, and 3) an automated recommendation system that has been well received by thousands of IT professionals.

Using the database of the crowdsourcing platform, we employ an unsupervised technique to regroup advisors with a high degree of similarities into clusters and, hence, shrink the search space. Afterward, we train a machine learning regression model to predict the matching score that can be achieved if an investor hires a particular advisor. These scores are converted to weights of bipartite graphs to which we apply a double-phased many-to-many maximum weight matching algorithm to determine a suitable investor-advisor combination. In the simulations, we investigate the performance of the proposed recruitment approach and show that, compared with other traditional approaches, higher returns can be reached for both investors and financial advisors.","2329-924X","","10.1109/TCSS.2020.3040901","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9294061","Crowdsourcing;financial technology;machine learning (ML);portfolio optimization","Crowdsourcing;Portfolios;Recruitment;Clustering algorithms;Prediction algorithms;Optimization;Regression tree analysis","","5","","18","IEEE","15 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Although such mechanisms have been investigated, we are the first to propose budget-balanced incentive tree mechanisms, called generalized lottrees, which require the total payout to be equal to the announced budget, while guaranteeing several desirable properties including continuing contribution incentive, continuing solicitation incentive, value proportional to contribution, unprofitable solicitor bypassing, and unprofitable Sybil attack.

In the ideal situation, all participants are considered accurate. Then, two optimization objectives are addressed for the efficient Crowdsourcing-Aided Positioning task. Their utility functions are proven to be submodular and a greedy algorithm is given to solve them. In the more realistic situation, randomly selected participants cannot guarantee the accuracy of the data. We propose a data-accuracy-calibration-based participant selection framework to solve this dilemma. Through data accuracy calibration, participants gain their data accuracy and reliability with the help of wireless sensor networks. First, we design three kinds of data accuracy calibration methods based on probabilistic models. Then, we propose a Truthful-Data-Driven Participant Selection problem, which tends to raise the data accuracy and reliability. The optimization problem is proved to be NP-hard and its optimization function has submodular property. We give a greedy algorithm with  $1-\frac {1}{e}$  approximation ratio to solve this problem.

However, the results from a query or mining process may not be reliable when the uncertainty propagates in the systems. In this paper, we leverage the power of crowdsourcing by designing a set of Human Intelligence Tasks, or HITs in short, to ask a crowd to improve the quality of uncertain data. In particular, we consider crowds consists of workers with diverse accuracy rates when answering the HITs. We design solutions to maximize the data quality with minimal number of HITs. There are two obstacles for this non-trivial optimization, which lead to very high computational cost for selecting the optimal set of HITs. First, members of a crowd may return incorrect answers with different probabilities. Second, the HITs decomposed from uncertain data are often correlated. We have addressed these challenges in this paper by designing an effective approximation algorithm and an efficient heuristic solution, especially for crowds with diverse individual accuracy rates. To further improve the efficiency, we derive tight lower and upper bounds for effective filtering and estimation.

Many existing approaches attempt to address this problem by using traditional data cleansing methods. In this paper, we address this problem by using an in-house crowdsourcing-based framework, namely, DedupCrowd. One of the main obstacles of crowdsourcing-based approaches is to monitor the performance of the crowd, by which the integrity of the whole process is maintained. In this paper, a statistical quality control-based technique is proposed to regulate the performance of the crowd. We apply our proposed framework in the context of a contact center, where the Customer Service Representatives are used as the crowd to assist in the process of deduplicating detection.

All of which requires continuous and accurate measurements of noise levels. The advent of smart city and IoT-based monitoring makes it possible for different technologies to cooperate in collecting and reporting environmental noise levels for longer duration and wider geographical region. Among others, mobile crowdsourcing (MCS) appears to be a promising technique for environmental noise monitoring with minimal upfront cost and almost no recurrent cost for regulators. This is due to the assumption of voluntary participation from mobile device owners who may be reluctant to participate if the recurrent cost of mobile resource consumption is high. In this work, an approach to improve mobile device resources efficiency for mobile crowdsourcing application in environmental noise monitoring is proposed. That is, noise samples from a device are collected only if it is significant to the accuracy of the measurements. Also this paper defines and mathematically formalizes the problem under study and develops two algorithms to optimize both resource and measurements efficiency.

Design/methodology/approach – This paper first proposed a model to depict the effect of four categories of game elements on three types of motivation based upon several motivation theories, which may, in turn, influence user participation. Then, $5\times 2$ between-subject Web experiments were designed for collecting data and validating this model. Findings – Game elements which provide participants with rewards and recognitions or remind participants of the completion progress of their tasks may positively influence the extrinsic motivation, whereas game elements which can help create a fantasy scene may strengthen intrinsic motivation. Besides, recognition-kind and progress-kind game elements may trigger the internalization of extrinsic motivation. In addition, when a task is of high complexity, the effects from game elements on extrinsic motivation and intrinsic motivation will be less prominent, whereas the internalization of extrinsic motivation may benefit from the increase of task complexity. Originality/value – This study may uncover the motivation mechanism of several different kinds of game elements, which may help to find which game elements are more effective in enhancing engagement and participation in crowdsourcing projects. Besides, as task complexity is used as a moderator, one may be able to identify whether task complexity is able to influence the effects from game elements on motivations. Last, but not the least, this study will indicate the interrelationship between game elements, individual motivation and user participation, which can be adapted by other scholars.","2398-7294","","10.1108/IJCS-12-2016-0001","National Social Science Fund of China(grant numbers:14AZD045); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9819807","Gamification;Crowd behaviour analysis;Crowd-sourced design and engineering;Task-oriented crowdsourcing;Paper type Conceptual paper","Crowdsourcing;Games;Data models;Complexity theory;Behavioral sciences;Task analysis;Context modeling","","4","","41","","7 Jul 2022","","","TUP","TUP Journals"

To achieve this goal, we design a sequence-to-sequence neural model composed of an encoder and decoder. Specifically, considering the complementarity phenomenon, the encoder synthesizes all the collected sentences into hidden states, which are then utilized by the decoder to generate the final sentence. Next, considering the spammer dilemma, we model the workers in the neural network to detect spammers.

In the online situation, we need to consider not only future unknown task arrivals, but also the heterogeneity of both tasks and workers.

To solve this problem, we first build an optimization framework to formulate this problem by explicitly modelling task utility and worker costs.

To address this issue, a robust sparse weighted classification algorithm is proposed, which try to adjust the samples that are not correctly classified in the original lables as much as possible. Specifically, we evalute the ability of different workers(indicator weight matrix) to accurately label different samples by fitting the real data matrix to its weighted reconstruction matrix. And then, $ l_{2,1}$l2,1-norm and worker labeling ability similarity matrix are added, and negative effects of some bad workers are eliminated through the row sparsity property of $ l_{2,1}$l2,1-norm. Finally, the optimal indicator weight matrix is obtained by optimizing the two matrices in the objective function simultaneously. Therefore, the obtained optimal indicator weight matrix takes the similarity of worker labeling ability into consideration, and infers all the predicted labels.

Since the SCC paradigm is relatively new, we apply methods from social network analysis and related fields to help answer important questions relevant to SCCs.

On the one hand, most recent studies concentrate on maximizing the overall benefits of the platform, ignoring the fact that user experience also plays an essential role in task allocation. On the other hand, they focus on matching, that is, how to assign tasks, rather than batching, that is, when to make assignment. In fact, user experience also depends on batching, but this is largely overlooked by current studies. In this paper, we propose a self-adaptive batching mechanism to enhance user experience in spatial crowdsourcing. With appropriate start-up timestamps, previous matching methods can perform better. Multi-armed bandit algorithm in reinforcement learning is adopted to split the batch dynamically according to historical current states. Extensive experimental results on both real and synthetic datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2940028","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61572336,61572335,61632016,61772356,61802344,61602400,61702227); Natural Science Research Project of Jiangsu Higher Education Institution(grant numbers:18KJA520010,17KJA520003); Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions; Hui-Chun Chin and Tsung-Dao Lee Chinese Undergraduate Research Endowment (CURE); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8827475","Spatial crowdsourcing;online task assignment;user experience;self-adaptive batching;multi-armed bandit","Task analysis;Resource management;User experience;Crowdsourcing;Real-time systems;Heuristic algorithms;Reinforcement learning","","2","","20","CCBY","9 Sep 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Since the weather stations are not densely distributed, it is difficult to get fine-grained particulate matter  $< 2.5~\mu \text{m}$  (PM2.5) data. We propose Meteorology Augmented Residual-Based Visual Approach for Crowdsourcing Air Quality Inference (MARVAir) to address limitations of traditional PM2.5 prediction mechanism. First, we use crowdsourcing and spider-bots to fetch visual and meteorological dataset, respectively. Second, a residual neural network (ResNet)-based visual core is designed to learn the image data, and a 1-D convolutional neural network (CNN)-based meteorology core is deployed to tune the inference. Besides, we use decision-level fusion mechanism to unite the submodels and provide precise yet everywhere available fine-grained PM2.5 inference. In addition, cloud-side model training is also proposed to restrict local energy consumption. Evaluation on dataset collected at eight sites over nearly two years suggests that MARVAir achieves a precision of 98.8%, a recall of 99.0%, and an  $F1$ -score of 98.9% under various air conditions, which notably exceed baseline solutions.","1557-9662","","10.1109/TIM.2022.3193197","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61872027,62072029); Open Research Fund of the State Key Laboratory of Integrated Services Networks(grant numbers:ISN21-16); Beijing Natural Science Foundation (NSF)(grant numbers:L192004); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9837081","Air quality;crowdsourcing;inference;model fusion;particulate matter <2.5 µm (PM2.5);smartphones;ubiquitous;visual","Meteorology;Data collection;Crowdsourcing;Visualization;Smart phones;Atmospheric modeling;Recording","","2","","24","IEEE","21 Jul 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Validation of the InSAR results depends largely on the in situ measurements. These measurements are usually point-wise and of high cost, as many sensors need to be set up for the long-term monitoring. In applications associated with a large area, qualitative and low-cost validation may be more necessary at the first place, which is still a challenge. In the recent decade, the crowdsourcing and volunteered geographic information (VGI) have been more and more accepted in the field of geoinformatics. Inspired by these, this letter proposes an InSAR crowdsourcing annotation system to integrate the InSAR displacements and the photographs uploaded by volunteers. We processed 119 Sentinel-1A data ranging from 2017 to 2021 to derive long-term displacements. Then, based on the InSAR displacements, task areas were selected and published to public via the system. Volunteers online accepted the task and uploaded photographs, indicating land displacements. In a coastal city, Shenzhen of China, 135 task areas were selected and published in total, and 1742 useful photographs were uploaded. The uploaded photographs were then inspected to validate and analyze the InSAR results. Post-analysis found some high correlation between the uploaded photographs with the InSAR alerting displacements. The proposed system is a prototype, and its interface and functions can be further extended in the future toward an effective and efficient alerting system for risking land deformations.","1558-0571","","10.1109/LGRS.2021.3134311","Chang’an University, Xi’an, China, through the National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2020YFC1512001); Shenzhen Scientific Research and Development Funding Programmes(grant numbers:JCYJ20190808120005713,KQJSCX20180328093453763,20200812164904001,20200807110745001); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(grant numbers:2019M663073); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:41974006); Research Program from the Department of Education of Guangdong Province(grant numbers:2018KTSCX196); Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation of Guangdong Province(grant numbers:2021A1515011427); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9645535","Deformation recognition and classification;interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR);time-series deformation;volunteered geographic information (VGI)","Task analysis;Crowdsourcing;Strain;Annotations;Hazards;Synthetic aperture radar;Buildings","","2","","18","IEEE","10 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Our experimentation compares high score matches against low score ones to find the best behaviors. We played 13 matches employing a known strategy for the problem to validate the methodology.

One area where this is the case is work progressing insufficiently or even grinding down to a halt. Such situations can be referred to as impasses and this has been captured more formally in the form of the Stasis pattern in previous work. In this paper, we first investigate the various forms stasis can take, next we characterize these forms in the form of a classification problem, and finally, detect their presence and predict the likelihood of their future occurrence in a practical setting. The latter is achieved through an exploratory case study involving computational analyses of development activities within an open-source crowd-sourced software platform (GitHub). Our findings contribute towards a rich understanding of stasis in crowdsourcing systems and how its various forms can be detected early (and thus mitigated) or even prevented altogether. As such, this work helps improve the chances of successful collaboration through the use of these systems.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3087172","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9448138","Co-destruction;crowdsourcing;stasis;detection;prediction","Crowdsourcing;Task analysis;Encyclopedias;Electronic publishing;Software development management;Collaboration;Production","","","","36","CCBY","7 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, we present a novel facial expression database, Real-world Affective Face Database (RAF-DB), which contains approximately 30 000 facial images with uncontrolled poses and illumination from thousands of individuals of diverse ages and races. During the crowdsourcing annotation, each image is independently labeled by approximately 40 annotators. An expectation-maximization algorithm is developed to reliably estimate the emotion labels, which reveals that real-world faces often express compound or even mixture emotions. A cross-database study between RAF-DB and CK+ database further indicates that the action units of real-world emotions are much more diverse than, or even deviate from, those of laboratory-controlled emotions. To address the recognition of multi-modal expressions in the wild, we propose a new deep locality-preserving convolutional neural network (DLP-CNN) method that aims to enhance the discriminative power of deep features by preserving the locality closeness while maximizing the inter-class scatter. Benchmark experiments on 7-class basic expressions and 11-class compound expressions, as well as additional experiments on CK+, MMI, and SFEW 2.0 databases, show that the proposed DLP-CNN outperforms the state-of-the-art handcrafted features and deep learning-based methods for expression recognition in the wild.

QoE crowdtesting refers to QoE assessment using crowdsourcing, where anonymous test subjects conduct subjective tests remotely in their preferred environment. The advantages of QoE crowdtesting lie not only in the reduced time and costs for the tests, but also in a large and diverse panel of international, geographically distributed users in realistic user settings. However, conceptual and technical challenges emerge due to the remote test settings. Key issues arising from QoE crowdtesting include the reliability of user ratings, the influence of incentives, payment schemes and the unknown environmental context of the tests on the results. In order to counter these issues, strategies and methods need to be developed, included in the test design, and also implemented in the actual test campaign, while statistical methods are required to identify reliable user ratings and to ensure high data quality. This contribution therefore provides a collection of best practices addressing these issues based on our experience gained in a large set of conducted QoE crowdtesting studies. The focus of this article is in particular on the issue of reliability and we use video quality assessment as an example for the proposed best practices, showing that our recommended two-stage QoE crowdtesting design leads to more reliable results.","1941-0077","","10.1109/TMM.2013.2291663","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6671455","Best practices;cognition;human computer inter action;instrumentation and measurement multimedia systems;testing","Streaming media;Testing;Reliability;Context;Best practices;Internet;Standards","","204","1","65","IEEE","20 Nov 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, in order to detect and describe the real time urban emergency event, the 5W (What, Where, When, Who, and Why) model is proposed. Firstly, users of social media are set as the target of crowd sourcing. Secondly, the spatial and temporal information from the social media are extracted to detect the real time event.

Our study failed to replicate previous findings in that subjects' accuracy was remarkably lower and visualizations exhibited no measurable benefit.

Furthermore, we devise a learning algorithm to train the DPDCM. Cloud computing is used to improve the training efficiency of the learning algorithm by crowdsourcing the data on cloud. To protect the private data, a privacy-preserving DPDCM (PPDPDCM) is proposed based on the BGV encryption scheme. Finally, experiments are carried on Animal-20 and NUS-WIDE-14 to estimate the performance of DPDCM and PPDPDCM by comparing with DCM. Results demonstrate that DPDCM achieves a higher classification accuracy than DCM.

It investigates the participation of urban taxis to support on demand take-out food delivery. Unlike existing SC-enabled service sharing systems (e.g., ridesharing), the delivery of food in FooDNet is more time-sensitive and the optimization problem is more complex regarding high-efficiency, huge-number of delivery needs. In particular, two on demand food delivery problems under different situations are studied in our work: (1) for O-OTOD, the food is opportunistically delivered by taxis when carrying passengers, and the optimization goal is to minimize the number of selected taxis to maintain a relatively high incentive to the participated drivers; (2) for D-OTOD, taxis dedicatedly deliver food without taking passengers, and the aim is to minimize the number of selected taxis (i.e., to raise the reward for each participant) and the total traveling distance to reduce the cost. A two-stage approach, including the construction algorithm and the Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search (ALNS) algorithm based on simulated annealing, is proposed to solve the problem. We have conducted extensive experiments based on the real-world datasets, including city-wide restaurant data, cell tower data, and the large-scale taxi trajectory data with 10,000 taxis in the city of Chengdu, China. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed algorithms are more effective and efficient than baselines, fulfilling the food delivery service using a smaller number of taxis within the given time.","1558-0660","","10.1109/TMC.2018.2861864","National Key R&D Program of China(grant numbers:2017YFB1001800); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61332005,61772428,61602067,61725205); National Basic Research Program of China(grant numbers:2015CB352400); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:2018cdqyjsj0024); Shenzhen University; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8424061","Spatial Crowdsouring;online takeout ordering & delivery;task allocation;optimization","Public transportation;Crowdsourcing;Task analysis;Urban areas;Mobile computing;Optimization;Sensors","","78","","41","IEEE","1 Aug 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Data aggregation, as a specific SC task, has drawn much attention in mining the potential value of the massive spatial crowdsensing data. However, the release of SC tasks and the execution of data aggregation may pose considerable threats to the privacy of TOs and mobile users, respectively. Besides, it is nontrivial for the SC-server to allocate numerous tasks efficiently and accurately to qualified mobile users, as the SC-server has no knowledge about the entire geographical user distribution. To tackle these issues, in this paper, we introduce a fog-assisted SC architecture, in which many fog nodes deployed in different regions can assist the SC-server to distribute tasks and aggregate data in a privacy-aware manner. Specifically, a privacy-aware task allocation and data aggregation scheme (PTAA) is proposed leveraging bilinear pairing and homomorphic encryption. PTAA supports representative aggregate statistics (e.g., sum, mean, variance, and minimum) with efficient data update while providing strong privacy protection. Security analysis shows that PTAA can achieve the desirable security goals.

With the advent of ubiquitous Internet access, it is now feasible to ask an Internet crowd to conduct QoE (Quality of Experience) experiments on their personal computers in their own residences rather than in a laboratory. The considerable size of the Internet crowd allows researchers to crowdsource their experiments to a more diverse set of participant pool at a relatively low economic cost. However, as participants carry out experiments without supervision, the uncertainty of the quality of their experiment results is a challenging problem. In this paper, we propose a crowdsourceable framework to quantify the QoE of multimedia content. To overcome the aforementioned quality problem, we employ a paired comparison method in our framework. The advantages of our framework are: 1) trustworthiness due to the support for cheat detection; 2) a simpler rating procedure than that of the commonly-used but more difficult mean opinion score (MOS), which places less burden on participants; 3) economic feasibility since reliable QoE measures can be acquired with less effort compared with MOS; and 4) generalizability across a variety of multimedia content. We demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed framework by a comparison with MOS. Moreover, the results of four case studies support our assertion that the framework can provide reliable QoE evaluation at a lower cost.","1941-0077","","10.1109/TMM.2013.2241043","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6415278","Crowdsourcing;mean opinion score;paired comparison;probabilistic choice model;quality of experience;subjective test","Multimedia communication;Internet;Reliability;Laboratories;Economics;Atmospheric measurements;Particle measurements","","60","","72","IEEE","18 Jan 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, we propose a differential privacy-based location protection (DPLP) scheme, which protects the location privacy of both workers and tasks, and achieves task allocation with high data utility. Specifically, DPLP splits the exact locations of both workers and tasks into noisy multi-level grids by using adaptive three-level grid decomposition (ATGD) algorithm and DP-based adaptive complete pyramid grid (DPACPG) algorithm, respectively, thereby considering the grid granularity and location privacy. Furthermore, DPLP adopts an optimal greedy algorithm to calculate a geocast region around the task grid, which achieves the trade-off between acceptance rate and system overhead. Detailed privacy analysis demonstrates that our DPLP scheme satisfies $\epsilon$ε-differential privacy. The extensive analysis and experiments over two real-world datasets confirm high efficiency and data utility of our scheme.","1939-1374","","10.1109/TSC.2019.2920643","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61872131,61472125); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8732376","Location privacy;spatial crowdsourcing;differential privacy;task allocation;data utility","Task analysis;Privacy;Noise measurement;Resource management;Differential privacy;Crowdsourcing","","58","","43","IEEE","6 Jun 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Finding the global optimal assignment turns out to be an intractable problem since it does not imply optimal assignment for individual worker. Observing that the task assignment dependency only exists amongst subsets of workers, we utilize tree-decomposition technique to separate workers into independent clusters and develop an efficient depth-first search algorithm with progressive bounds to prune non-promising assignments.

We study two approaches for crowd aggregation on multicategory answer spaces: stochastic modeling-based and deterministic objective function-based. Our stochastic model for answer generation plausibly captures the interplay between worker skills, intentions, and task difficulties and captures a broad range of worker types. Our deterministic objective-based approach aims to maximize the average aggregate confidence of weighted plurality crowd decision making. In both approaches, we explicitly model the skill and intention of individual workers, which is exploited for improved crowd aggregation. Our methods are applicable in both unsupervised and semi-supervised settings, and also when the batch of tasks is heterogeneous, i.e., from multiple domains, with task-dependent answer spaces.

However, existing worker recruitment approaches mainly focus on how to select the most suitable workers for tasks from a large worker pool, while the recruitment problem under insufficient workers (e.g., a new MCS system) has not been well addressed. In this paper, we focus on the insufficient participation problem of MCS systems with limited number of workers, and propose to leverage social network to recruit workers for task completion as well as expanding the worker pool. To this end, we propose a dynamic incentive mechanism, called SocialRecruiter, to encourage workers on the MCS platform to propagate tasks through social networks, so that inviting friends to join in the MCS platform to further propagate and complete tasks. Motivated by the SIR epidemic model, we propose a novel task-specific epidemic model to characterize the status change of users for task propagation and completion through social networks. In order to encourage task completion and propagation, the propagating reward and completing reward are provided according to workers’ actions. In particular, in order to maximize the task completion within the financial budget, the propagating and completing rewards are dynamically updated at each cycle according to real-time worker recruitment progress. The extensive experimental results on two real-world datasets demonstrate that SocialRecruiter outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches in terms of worker recruitment and task completion.","1558-0660","","10.1109/TMC.2020.2973958","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61872274,61702562,61772472,61822207); Equipment Pre-Research Joint Fund of Ministry of Education of China(grant numbers:6141A02033327); National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2018YFB1003702); Hunan Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China for Distinguished Young Scholars(grant numbers:2018JJ1025); Natural Science Foundation of Hubei Province(grant numbers:2017CFB503, 2017CFA047, 2017CFA007); Science and Technology planning project of ShenZhen(grant numbers:JCYJ20170818112550194); Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province(grant numbers:LY17F020020); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:2042018gf0043, and 2042019gf0098); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8999584","Mobile crowdsourcing;worker recruitment;incentive;social network","Task analysis;Social network services;Recruitment;Sensors;Crowdsourcing;Mobile computing;Real-time systems","","42","","36","IEEE","14 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, the exposure of users' locations raises privacy concerns. In this paper, we propose a location privacy-preserving task allocation framework with geo-obfuscation to protect users' locations during task assignments. More specifically, we make participants obfuscate their reported locations under the guarantee of two rigorous privacy-preserving schemes, differential and distortion privacy, without the need to involve any third-party trusted entity. In order to achieve optimal task allocation with the differential-and-distortion geo-obfuscation, we formulate a mixed-integer non-linear programming problem to minimize the expected travel distance of the selected workers under the constraints of differential and distortion privacy. Moreover, a worker may be willing to accept multiple tasks, and a task organizer may be concerned with multiple utility objectives such as task acceptance ratio in addition to travel distance. Against this background, we also extend our solution to the multi-task allocation and multi-objective optimization cases. Evaluation results on both simulation and real-world user mobility traces verify the effectiveness of our framework. Particularly, our framework outperforms Laplace obfuscation, a state-of-the-art geo-obfuscation mechanism, by achieving up to 47 percent shorter average travel distance on real-world data under the same level of privacy protection.","1941-0018","","10.1109/TDSC.2019.2912886","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61572048,71601106); State Language Commission of China Key Program(grant numbers:ZDI135-18); Hong Kong ITF(grant numbers:ITS/391/15FX); ERC Consolidator(grant numbers:683253); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8695792","Mobile crowdsensing;differential location privacy;distortion location privacy;task allocation;travel distance","Task analysis;Privacy;Resource management;Distortion;Differential privacy;Crowdsourcing;Optimization","","41","","48","IEEE","23 Apr 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Researchers have proposed techniques to identify truth from noisy data by inferring and utilizing the reliability of mobile users, and allocate tasks to users with higher reliability. However, they neglect the fact that a user may only have expertise on some problems (in some domains), but not others, and hence causing two problems: low estimation accuracy in truth analysis and ineffective task allocation. To address these problems, we propose Expertise-aware Truth Analysis and Task Allocation (ETA2), which can effectively infer user expertise, and then estimate truth and allocate tasks based on the inferred expertise. ETA2 relies on a novel semantic analysis method to identify the expertise, and an expertise-aware truth analysis method to find the truth. For expertise-aware task allocation in ETA2, we formalize and solve two problems based on the optimization objectives: max-qualitytask allocation which maximizes the probability fortasks to be allocated to users with high expertise and min-costtask allocation which minimizes the cost of task allocation while ensuring high-quality data are collected. Experimental results based on two real-world datasets and one synthetic dataset demonstrate that ETA2 significantly outperforms existing solutions.","1558-0660","","10.1109/TMC.2019.2955688","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8911265","Mobile crowdsourcing;truth analysis;task allocation","Task analysis;Resource management;Servers;Reliability;Crowdsourcing;Gaussian distribution;Sensors","","36","","42","IEEE","25 Nov 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

One of the examples is in spatial crowdsourcing (SC). It enables people not only to issue spatiotemporal tasks to ask for help as requesters but also to solve others’ tasks as workers on the SC platform. While SC brings convenience to people, it also produces severe location privacy problems, which have been recently paid more attention from both academia and industries. In this article, we address the location privacy problem in SC in a practical and secure way. We propose a location privacy-preserving framework for almost all existed mainstream distance computations in the SC system, namely, Euclidean-L3P, Minkowski-L3P, Manhattan-L3P, and Chebyshev-L3P, among which the first two are constructed based on homomorphic encryption and composite-order multilinear mapping while the latter two on the homomorphic encryption and prefix membership verification approach. Location privacy is resolved because of the above techniques having enabled that all distance computations are evaluated through ciphertexts without disclosing any location information. Security analysis shows that our framework can prevent a strong adversary from obtaining participants’ location privacy. Performance analysis evaluates computation and communication overheads between protocols. The results show that Euclidean-L3P is more efficient than Manhattan-L3P and Chebyshev-L3P in terms of computation overheads when the SC applications require a small number of participants, a large plaintext space, and a small number of base stations. Moreover, compared with Manhattan-L3P and Chebyshev-L3P, Euclidean-L3P is a better choice in terms of communication overhead.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2020.2985454","Key Research and Development Program of Zhejiang Province(grant numbers:2020C01076); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61906167,61572355,61972050,U1936120,U1636216); Key Research and Development Program of Hangzhou(grant numbers:20182011A46); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9056800","Distance computation;data privacy;homomorphic encryption;Internet of Things;location privacy preserving;smart cities;spatial crowdsourcing (SC)","Task analysis;Privacy;Crowdsourcing;Chebyshev approximation;Encryption;Data privacy","","35","","39","IEEE","3 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, data collection, data aggregation, and data analysis have become challenging problems for a resource constrained requester when data volume is extremely large, i.e., big data. In particular to data analysis, set operations, including intersection, union, and complementation, exist in most big data analysis for filtering redundant data and preprocessing raw data. Facing challenges in terms of limited computation and storage resources, cloud-assisted approaches may serve as a promising way to tackle the big data analysis issue. However, workers may not be willing to participate if the privacy of their sensing data and identity are not well preserved in the untrusted cloud. In this paper, we propose to the use cloud to compute a set operation for the requester, at the same time workers' data privacy and identities privacy are well preserved. Besides, the requester can verify the correctness of set operation results. We also extend our scheme to support data preprocessing, with which invalid data can be excluded before data analysis. By using batch verification and data update methods, the proposed scheme greatly reduces the computational cost. Extensive performance analysis and experiment based on real cloud system have shown both the feasibility and efficiency of our proposed scheme.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2016.2585592","U.S. National Science Foundation(grant numbers:CNS-1343220,CNS-1149786); National Science Foundation(grant numbers:CNS-1566634); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7501505","Big data;mobile crowdsourcing;privacy;verifiable computation","Cloud computing;Mobile communication;Crowdsourcing;Data privacy;Big data;Cryptography;Smart phones","","35","","41","USGov","28 Jun 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
