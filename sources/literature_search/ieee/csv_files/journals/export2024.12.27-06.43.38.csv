Crowdsourced software development has provided a new method for the software industry to produce quality software based on an open-call format. Selecting an appropriate task to develop (developer-end) or evaluate (platform-end) is one of the primary problems in this type of open-call format. Receiving or assigning an improper task to an improper crowdsource (CS) developer does not only decrease the quality of the software deliverables, but also causes overburden on both the platform and the developers. To solve this problem, sorting the tasks based on the developers' human characteristics may increase task relevancy for developers, which can accelerate efficiency and lessen complexity. Thus, this paper has conducted an empirical experiment to measure the influence of personality on task selection based on the important characteristics of a task: money, time, and type. A total of 83 students from the University of Sindh voluntarily participated in four different short-duration rounds of task development using the developed CS platform. The personality types of the participants were measured based on the Myers-Briggs type indicator. In addition, a complex network technique called weighted degree centrality was applied to identify the most suitable personality for task sorting based on money or complexity attractions (i.e., time or type). Based on the results, it can be observed that personality has a significant relationship with task selection. For instance, developers with intuitive (N) and feeling (F) personality traits are primarily focused on the time duration of a project.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2747660","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61374214); National Key Research and Development Program(grant numbers:2016 YFB 0502004); Open Project of the Beijing Key Laboratory of Mobile Computing and Pervasive Device; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8026018","Crowdsource;software development;personality types;MBTI;sorting","Software;Crowdsourcing;Sorting;Complexity theory;Industries;Atmospheric measurements;Particle measurements","","20","","38","OAPA","6 Sep 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Addressing this challenge, this paper proposes to crowdsource the parcel delivery task to urban vehicles to utilize their spare capacities, thus improving the efficiency while reducing traffic congestions. The delivery is planned as a multi-hop process, and participating vehicles will carry parcels from one shipping point to the next until they arrive at the destination, following the routes learned from the historical traffic statistics. The major contributions include an incentive framework to motivate the vehicles to participate in the delivery tasks by preserving the interests of the platform, the sender, and the crowd vehicles. Two incentive models are designed from platform-centric and user-centric perspectives, respectively. The platform-centric model first assesses an optimal reward $R$ for parcel delivery with the principle of Stackelberg game, which enables the platform to maximize its profit. The user-centric model then applies a reverse auction mechanism to select the winning bids of vehicles while minimizing the sender cost, with truthfulness guarantee. Theoretical analysis and extensive experiments on a real urban vehicle trace dataset are provided to validate the efficacy of the proposed framework.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2896912","National Key R&D Program of China(grant numbers:2017YFB0803300); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61772074); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8632908","Crowdsourcing;delivery tasks;incentive model;auction-based mechanism","Crowdsourcing;Task analysis;Logistics;Spread spectrum communication;Vehicles;Biological system modeling","","19","","38","OAPA","1 Feb 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The successful technology adoption of Crowd-MECS relies on a comprehensive understanding of the complicated economic interactions and strategic decision making of different stakeholders in the ecosystem. In this article, we focus on studying the economic and strategic interactions between one content provider (CP) and a large crowd of EDs, where the CP designs the incentive scheme for EDs to cache and share contents, and EDs decide whether to cache and share contents for the CP. We formulate their interactions as a two-stage Stackelberg game. In Stage I, the CP decides the ratio of revenue (as incentives) shared with EDs who choose to cache and share contents, aiming at maximizing its own profit. In Stage II, EDs choose to be agents who cache and share contents, and meanwhile gain a certain revenue from the CP, or requesters who do not cache but request contents in the on-demand fashion. We first analyze the EDs’ best responses and prove the existence and uniqueness of the equilibrium in Stage II by using the nonatomic game theory. Then, we identify the piecewise structure and the unimodal feature of the CP’s profit function, based on which we design a tailored low-complexity 1-D search algorithm to achieve the optimal revenue sharing ratio for the CP in Stage I. The simulation results show that both the CP’s profit and the EDs’ total welfare can be improved significantly (e.g., by 120% and 50%, respectively,) by using the proposed Crowd-MECS system, comparing with the non-MEC system where the CP serves all EDs directly.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2020.2980968","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61902255,61972113,61801145,61901138,U1713212,61572330); Basic Research Project of Shenzhen Science and Technology Program(grant numbers:JCYJ20190808163417094,JCYJ20190806112215116,JCYJ20180306171800589); Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province–Outstanding Youth Program(grant numbers:2019B151502018); General Program(grant numbers:2018A030313298); Guangdong Science and Technology Planning Project(grant numbers:2018B030322004); Technology Research Project of Shenzhen City(grant numbers:JSGG20180507182904693); Public Technology Platform of Shenzhen City(grant numbers:GGFW2018021118145859); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9036952","Crowdsourcing;game theory;mobile edge caching (MEC);network economics;peer content sharing","Economics;Incentive schemes;Games;Wireless fidelity;Crowdsourcing;Simulation","","16","","39","IEEE","16 Mar 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

As fingerprinting-based methods rely on ubiquitous information in buildings, the need for additional infrastructure is discarded. Still, the time-consuming manual process to acquire fingerprints limits their applicability in most scenarios. This paper proposes an algorithm for the automatic construction of environmental fingerprints on multi-storey buildings, leveraging the information sources available in each scenario. It relies on unlabelled crowdsourced data from users’ smartphones. With only the floor plans as input, a demand for most applications, we apply a multimodal approach that joins inertial data, local magnetic field and Wi-Fi signals to construct highly accurate fingerprints. Precise movement estimation is achieved regardless of smartphone usage through Deep Neural Networks, and the transition between floors detected from barometric data. Users’ trajectories obtained with Pedestrian Dead Reckoning techniques are partitioned into clusters with Wi-Fi measurements. Straight sections from the same cluster are then compared with subsequence Dynamic Time Warping to search for similarities. From the identified overlapping sections, a particle filter fits each trajectory into the building’s floor plans. From all successfully mapped routes, fingerprints labelled with physical locations are finally obtained. Experimental results from an office and a university building show that this solution constructs comparable fingerprints to those acquired manually, thus providing a useful tool for fingerprinting-based solutions automatic setup.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3060123","project Geolocation non-Assisted by GPS for Mobile Networks in Indoor and Outdoor Environment (GARMIO), co-funded by Portugal 2020, framed through the COMPETE 2020 (Operational Programme Competitiveness and Internationalization) and European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) from European Union (EU)(grant numbers:POCI-01-0247-FEDER-033479); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9358191","Crowdsourcing;fingerprinting;indoor location;inertial tracking;magnetic field;multi-storey;unsupervised;Wi-Fi","Wireless fidelity;Crowdsourcing;Buildings;Trajectory;Sensors;Smart phones;IP networks","","15","","32","CCBY","19 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, problems such as inappropriate assignment and delayed delivery still exist in current food delivery platforms. To address these issues, this paper presents a Crowdsourced Recommending-and-Grabbing (CRG) system for order allocation in on-demand food delivery service. Unlike other traditional logistics systems, the CRG system considers the preferences of crowdsourced riders and allocates orders by recommending them to suitable crowdsourced riders. Riders can grab their favorite orders from personalized order lists. To optimize the experience of both customers and crowdsourced riders, a hierarchical solution framework composed of prediction and optimization is proposed to generate satisfactory order allocation schemes. First at the prediction part, we predict the preferences of crowdsourced riders by establishing a predictive model using eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost). Then at the optimization phase, an allocating-and-sequencing algorithm is designed to appropriately expose orders to crowdsourced riders and sequence the order list for each rider. Extensive experiments are conducted on real-world datasets and the comparative results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods, suggesting that the presented CRG system is promising to facilitate the on-demand food delivery effectively and efficiently.","1558-0016","","10.1109/TITS.2022.3209722","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62273193); Meituan; Tsinghua University—Meituan Joint Institute for Digital Life; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9907878","On-demand food delivery;order allocation;recommending-and-grabbing;crowdsourced riders","Task analysis;Resource management;Crowdsourcing;Logistics;Predictive models;Dynamic scheduling;Vehicle dynamics","","14","","34","IEEE","3 Oct 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Generally, MCS has a lower cost but often confronts sensing imbalance and even blind areas due to the limitation of human mobility, whereas UVS is often capable of completing more demanding tasks at the expense of limited energy supply and hardware cost. Thus, it is significant to investigate whether we could integrate the two paradigms for high-quality urban sensing in a cost-effective collaborative way. However, it is nontrivial due to complex and long-term optimization objectives, uncontrolled dynamics, and a large number of heterogeneous agents. To address the collaborative sensing problem, we propose an actor-critic-based heterogeneous collaborative reinforcement learning (HCRL) algorithm, which leverages several key ideas: local observation to handle expanded state space and extract the states of neighbor nodes, generalized model to avoid environment nonstationarity and ensure the scalability and stability of network, and proximal policy optimization to prevent the destructively large policy updates. Extensive simulations based on a mobility model and a realistic trace data set are conducted to confirm that HCRL outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2021.3062569","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2018AAA0101201); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61972044,61732017); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:2020XD-A09-1); Funds for International Cooperation and Exchange of NSFC(grant numbers:61720106007); 111 Project(grant numbers:B18008); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9365704","Collaborative scheduling;mobile crowdsensing (MCS);reinforcement learning;unmanned vehicle sensing (UVS)","Sensors;Collaboration;Optimization;Unmanned vehicles;Task analysis;Reinforcement learning;Scalability","","12","","51","IEEE","1 Mar 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, despite the fact that people spend most of their time indoors, these applications are still limited to indoor spaces due to the lack of large-scale indoor floorplan databases. In this paper, we present JustWalk: a crowd intelligence-based system for the automatic construction of buildings floorplans. JustWalk employs a participatory sensing approach using smartphones that are ubiquitously available with users who visit a building to automatically and transparently construct accurate motion traces. These accurate traces are generated by reducing the errors in the inertial motion traces by using the points of interest in the indoor environment (e.g., elevators and stairs, etc.) for error resetting. The collected traces are then processed by means of different mathematical and image processing techniques to detect the overall floorplan shape as well as higher level semantics such as detecting rooms and corridors shapes along with a variety of points of interest in the environment. In comparison to other approaches, our system depends only on the users walking patterns and motion traces. It does not require any explicit inputs or obtrusive actions (e.g., taking photos). Experimental evaluation of JustWalk using different android phones in three testbeds shows that it achieves high accuracy for the point of interest detection (0.6 percent false positive and 1 percent false negative rates). In addition, the proposed error resetting technique leads to more than 12 times enhancement in the median distance error compared to the state-of-the-art. Moreover, the detailed floorplan can be accurately estimated with a relatively small number of traces. This number is amortized over the number of users visiting the building. Finally, we show that JustWalk has a small energy footprint on cell-phones, and could be generalized to other buildings; highlighting its promise as a ubiquitous indoor mapping service.","1558-0660","","10.1109/TMC.2018.2874251","Google Research Award; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8482292","Indoor mapping;automatic floorplan construction;location-based services","Buildings;Sensors;Acceleration;Magnetometers;Shape;Gyroscopes;Trajectory","","11","","27","IEEE","5 Oct 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Recent statistics show that drowsy drivers cause an estimated 15.5% of fatal accidents. With the widespread use of mobile devices and roadside units, these accidents can be significantly prevented using a drowsiness detection solution. While several solutions were proposed in the literature, they all fall short of presenting a distributed architecture that can answer the needs of these applications without breaching the driver’s privacy. This paper proposes a two-stage Driver Drowsiness Detection System using smart edge computing. Mobile devices in the car are used to capture and analyze the current condition of the drivers without sharing their data. The smart edge is deployed as a decision-maker where the drowsiness is confirmed when the information about the driver status received from the mobile client and the observed car path match. Our approach relies on a) a distributed edge architecture that has two levels of hierarchy, namely the Main Edge Node (MEN) and Local Edge Node (LEN), to better manage the area of interest and b) a data fusion offloading strategy that considers: 1) local detection of driver drowsiness through facial expressions using CNN model, 2) global detection of car path through acceleration readings using YoLov5 algorithm, and finally, 3) a two-layer LSTM algorithm for drowsiness detection based on the local and the global detection.

Using flooding scenario as a guiding example, this paper illustrates the structure and functioning of the different tools proposed to support citizens scientists in their projects, and a methodological approach to their use.

However, such datasets depend on an enormous amount of human labeling effort. When the labels correspond to well-known concepts, it is straightforward to train the annotators by giving a few examples with known answers. It is also straightforward to judge the quality of their labels. Neither is true when there are thousands of complex domain-specific labels. Training on all labels is infeasible and the quality of an annotator's judgements may be vastly different for some subsets of labels than for others. This paper proposes a set of data-driven algorithms to 1) train image annotators on how to disambiguate among automatically generated candidate labels, 2) evaluate the quality of annotators’ label suggestions, and 3) weigh predictions. The algorithms adapt to the skills of each annotator both in the questions asked and the weights given to their answers. The underlying judgements are Bayesian, based on adaptive priors. We measure the benefits of these algorithms on a live user experiment related to image-based plant identification involving around 1000 people. The proposed methods are shown to enable huge gains in annotation accuracy. A standard user can correctly label around $2\%$  of our data. This goes up to $80\%$  with machine learning assisted training and assignment and up to almost  $90\%$ when doing a weighted combination of several annotators’ labels.","1941-0077","","10.1109/TMM.2017.2653763","INRIA International Chair; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7819540","Crowdsourcing;Bayes methods;parameter estimation;Taylor series","Bayes methods;Crowdsourcing;Training;Multimedia communication;Probability distribution;Labeling;Prediction algorithms","","7","","38","IEEE","16 Jan 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The electricity market has been proved to be an efficient way to employ market signals to direct behaviors of users and DERs with large capacity and homogeneous pattern. However, existing market frameworks cannot effectively handle a large number of small-scale DERs due to their diverse characteristics and arbitrary behavior patterns. In this context, an aggregated model which can represent and manage a diverse collection of DER, load, and storage is proposed.

The applications and other research efforts have been sought to include other features such as 3D maps, neighboring facilities, traffic information, and multi-modal alternate route suggestion based on user constraints. None of these, however, take into account an important factor: “user safety while commuting”. Although the common perception of street crime is that it is primarily a problem in the third-world countries, current popular hashtags or topics (e.g. “blacklifematters”) indicate that it is now prevalent in other parts of the world as well. Even existing multi-modal alternative route recommender systems are incapable of adapting to a dynamic set of safety features, are unable to provide new safe path updates in response to real-time commuter responses, and take little or no account of historical on-road events when designing the safe algorithm. In light of the above background, we begin by developing a generic framework, namely On-road Risk Minimization Problem (ORMP). We then introduce a dynamic population-based algorithm, that we call Safe Path for Everyone (SPaFE), that solves ORMP using multi-modal historical and crowdsourced data.

This study is primarily concerned with the extraction and comprehension of the methodologies and strategies employed by individuals when confronted with intricate problems, specifically those falling under the purview of NP-hard problems. The Facility Location Problem (FLP) serves as a prominent exemplar within this study’s framework. Traditionally, the handling of such complex problems has leaned upon intuitive reasoning and visual perception as the primary tools. However, these conventional approaches tend to provide only limited insight into the underlying processes employed in solving such problems. The present research seeks to bridge this knowledge gap through the utilization of advanced machine learning techniques for the purpose of categorizing and scrutinizing the strategies deployed by individuals in their attempts to tackle computationally challenging problems. The analysis conducted as part of this study unveils discernible and well-defined patterns and strategies that are employed by participants, some of whom have achieved notable levels of success. Remarkably, in certain instances, the outcomes achieved by these individuals have demonstrated a competitive edge when compared to the results produced by sophisticated computational methods, such as genetic algorithms. A fundamental component of our research methodology involves the application of heatmaps and clustering techniques. Through the normalization of results, our findings distinctly delineate two primary categories of games: those characterized by uniform player strategies and those characterized by a multitude of diverse and individualized tactics. Furthermore, our research employs a systematic approach to represent games by clustering them based on inherent similarities, utilizing cosine similarity as a metric for this purpose. By computing the averages of vectors within each cluster, we derive centroids that encapsulate the central tendencies exhibited by games belonging to that cluster. These centroids are then visually presented in a three-dimensional format, complemented by proportional spheres. These visual representations serve to vividly illustrate the dispersion and influence associated with each cluster. Our research significantly contributes to the understanding of human problem-solving strategies when confronted with computationally challenging problems. It unearths valuable insights regarding the potential for harnessing human intuition and expertise in addressing complex computational challenges. Through the integration of machine learning methodologies and intuitive visualizations, this work advances our comprehension of the approaches individuals employ to excel in solving computationally intricate problems.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3328175","Consejo Nacional de Humanidades Ciencia y Tecnologias (CONAHCYT) under Investigadoras e Investigadores por México (IxM) Program; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10298065","Facility location problem (FLP);crowdsourcing;machine learning;video game;clustering;strategy","Games;Video games;Crowdsourcing;Costs;Machine learning;Optimization;Task analysis;Location awareness;Clustering methods","","","","29","CCBY","27 Oct 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

These communities typically involve voluntary participation, and given that these communities are not organization specific, community members' motivations for participation vary. In this study, we investigate the motivations of the members of a professional virtual community to engage in knowledge exchange. We synthesize social exchange theory and the theory of reasoned action to identify critical determinants of attitudes toward knowledge exchange in virtual communities, namely, trust among participants, anticipated reciprocal relationships, and the relevance of the community to participants' jobs. Additionally, we posit that attitudes will influence the intention to use the virtual community and that this relationship will be moderated by the perceived quality of the information exchanged within the community. We test our research model using data compiled from a community of research scientists in South Korea. Our findings indicate that trust among participants has a positive influence on attitudes toward both sharing and acquiring knowledge. The anticipation of a reciprocal relationship has a positive effect on attitudes toward knowledge acquisition, and job relevance has a positive effect on attitudes toward knowledge sharing. Furthermore, attitudes toward knowledge acquisition affect attitudes toward knowledge sharing, and attitudes toward knowledge sharing positively influence intentions to use a virtual community. We also find that perceived information quality negatively moderates the relationship between attitudes toward knowledge sharing and user intentions to use a virtual community.

Knowledge-driven IIoT plays an unprecedented role in application fields such as cyber-physical systems and Industry 4.0. However, knowledge is generally scattered across the distributed edge devices of IIoT. Therefore, in order to further achieve the edge intelligence in IIoT, it is very important to explore an efficient edge knowledge sharing method. In this article, we establish a decentralized knowledge sharing platform in IIoT. First, for public knowledge, a dynamics model that can quantitatively describe its sharing process is established by using the system dynamics theory. Furthermore, a control method for maximizing public knowledge sharing under constraints based on the optimal control theory is presented. Second, for private knowledge, a trusted transaction control method based on blockchain technology is proposed. By developing both smart contract and lightweight consensus mechanism, the efficient peer-to-peer sharing of private knowledge is realized, and the integrity of knowledge and the privacy of participants are protected.

However, with increasing question posts over time and the posts covering a wide range of topics (unlike focused Q&A sites like Stack Overflow), not all of them are getting answered. Measuring answerability (i.e., whether a question shall get answered or not) involves collecting expensive human judgment data that can differentiate the characteristics of an answered question from an unanswered (aka open) one. Factors to judge if a question would remain open include its subjectivity, openendedness, vagueness, ambiguity, and so on. It is difficult to collect such judgments for thousands of questions, requiring automatic framework to deal the issue of answerability of questions. In this paper, we quantify: 1) user-level and 2) question-level linguistic activities—that can nicely correspond to many of the judgment factors noted earlier, can be easily measured for each question post and that appropriately discriminates an answered question from an unanswered one. Our central finding is that the way users use language while writing the question text can be a very effective means to characterize answerability. This characterization further helps us to predict early if a question remaining unanswered for a specific time period  $t$  will eventually be answered or not and achieve an accuracy of 76.26% ( $t=1$  month) and 68.33% ( $t=3$  months). Notably, features representing the language use patterns of the users are most discriminative and alone account for an accuracy of 74.18%.

Search engines provided in Q&A sites and information retrieval approaches (e.g., word embedding-based) have limited capabilities to retrieve relevant questions when queries are imprecisely specified, such as missing important technical details (e.g., the user’s preferred programming languages). Although many automatic query expansion approaches have been proposed to improve the quality of queries by expanding queries with relevant terms, the information missed in a query is not identified. Moreover, without user involvement, the existing query expansion approaches may introduce unexpected terms and lead to undesired results. In this paper, we propose an interactive query refinement approach for question retrieval, named Chatbot4QR, which can assist users in recognizing and clarifying technical details missed in queries and thus retrieve more relevant questions for users. Chatbot4QR automatically detects missing technical details in a query and generates several clarification questions (CQs) to interact with the user to capture their overlooked technical details. To ensure the accuracy of CQs, we design a heuristic-based approach for CQ generation after building two kinds of technical knowledge bases: a manually categorized result of 1,841 technical tags in SO and the multiple version-frequency information of the tags. We develop a Chatbot4QR prototype that uses 1.88 million SO questions as the repository for question retrieval. To evaluate Chatbot4QR, we conduct six user studies with 25 participants on 50 experimental queries. The results are as follows. (1) On average 60.8 percent of the CQs generated for a query are useful for helping the participants recognize missing technical details. (2) Chatbot4QR can rapidly respond to the participants after receiving a query within approximately 1.3 seconds. (3) The refined queries contribute to retrieving more relevant SO questions than nine baseline approaches. For more than 70 percent of the participants who have preferred techniques on the query tasks, Chatbot4QR significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art word embedding-based retrieval approach with an improvement of at least 54.6 percent in terms of two measurements: Pre$@$@k and NDCG$@$@k. (4) For 48-88 percent of the assigned query tasks, the participants obtain more desired results after interacting with Chatbot4QR than directly searching from Web search engines (e.g., the SO search engine and Google) using the original queries.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2020.3016006","National Key R&D Program of China(grant numbers:2019YFB1600700); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61972339); Australian Research Council(grant numbers:DE200100021); Ministry of Education – Singapore(grant numbers:MOE2019-T2-1-193); Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; Alibaba-Zhejiang University Joint Institute of Frontier Technologies; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9165927","Interactive query refinement;chatbot;question retrieval;stack overflow","Search engines;Web search;Java;Task analysis;Engines;Databases","","17","","49","IEEE","12 Aug 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, we propose a high-coverage approach that collects known security patches by tracking multiple data sources. Specifically, we considered the following three data sources: repositories (e. g., GitHub), issue trackers (e. g., Bugzilla), and Q&A sites (e. g., Stack Overflow). From the data sources, we gather even security patches that cannot be collected by considering only CVE information (i. e., previously untracked security patches). In our experiments, we collected 12,432 CVE patches from repositories and issue trackers, and 12,458 insecure posts from Q&A sites. We could collect at least four times more CVE patches than those collected in existing approaches, which demonstrates the efficacy of our approach.

On the contrary, the discussions about APIs on social Q&A sites provide enriching usages.

The benefits of visualization for synchronous group knowledge work, however, have not been addressed extensively. Anecdotal evidence and use cases illustrate the benefits of synchronous collaborative information visualization, but very few empirical studies have rigorously examined the impact of visualization on group knowledge work. We have consequently designed and conducted an experiment in which we have analyzed the impact of visualization on knowledge sharing in situated work groups. Our experimental study consists of evaluating the performance of 131 subjects (all experienced managers) in groups of 5 (for a total of 26 groups), working together on a real-life knowledge sharing task. We compare (1) the control condition (no visualization provided), with two visualization supports: (2) optimal and (3) suboptimal visualization (based on a previous survey). The facilitator of each group was asked to populate the provided interactive visual template with insights from the group, and to organize the contributions according to the group consensus. We have evaluated the results through both objective and subjective measures. Our statistical analysis clearly shows that interactive visualization has a statistically significant, objective and positive impact on the outcomes of knowledge sharing, but that the subjects seem not to be aware of this. In particular, groups supported by visualization achieved higher productivity, higher quality of outcome and greater knowledge gains. No statistically significant results could be found between an optimal and a suboptimal visualization though (as classified by the pre-experiment survey). Subjects also did not seem to be aware of the benefits that the visualizations provided as no difference between the visualization and the control conditions was found for the self-reported measures of satisfaction and participation. An implication of our study for information visualization applications is to extend them by using real-time group annotation functionalities that aid in the group sense making process of the represented data.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2009.188","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5290714","Laboratory Studies;Visual Knowledge Representation;Collaborative and Distributed Visualization;synchronous situated collaboration;group work;experiment;knowledge sharing","Collaboration;Data visualization;Collaborative work;Data analysis;Information analysis;Knowledge management;Optimal control;Statistical analysis;Productivity;Particle measurements","","43","","49","IEEE","23 Oct 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, it is rarely used in dynamic combinatorial optimization problems, which have valuable practical applications such as dynamic flexible job-shop scheduling (DFJSS) in manufacturing. Genetic programming (GP), as a popular hyperheuristic approach, has been used to learn scheduling heuristics for generating schedules for multitask single-objective DFJSS only. Searching in the heuristic space with GP is more difficult than in the solution space, since a small change on heuristics can lead to ineffective or even infeasible solutions. Multiobjective DFJSS is more challenging than single DFJSS, since a scheduling heuristic needs to cope with multiple objectives. To tackle this challenge, we first propose a multipopulation-based multitask multiobjective GP algorithm to preserve the quality of the learned scheduling heuristics for each task. Furthermore, we develop a multitask multiobjective GP algorithm with a task-oriented knowledge-sharing strategy to further improve the effectiveness of learning scheduling heuristics for DFJSS. The results show that the designed multipopulation-based GP algorithms, especially the one with the task-oriented knowledge-sharing strategy, can achieve good performance for all the examined tasks by maintaining the quality and diversity of individuals for corresponding tasks well. The learned Pareto fronts also show that the GP algorithm with task-oriented knowledge-sharing strategy can learn competitive scheduling heuristics for DFJSS on both of the objectives.","2168-2275","","10.1109/TCYB.2022.3196887","Marsden Fund of New Zealand Government(grant numbers:MFP-VUW1913,VUW1614); Science for Technological Innovation Challenge Fund(grant numbers:2019-S7-CRS); MBIE SSIF Fund(grant numbers:VUW RTVU1914); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9868257","Dynamic job-shop scheduling;genetic programming (GP);hyperheuristics;multiobjective;multitask learning","Task analysis;Optimization;Heuristic algorithms;Job shop scheduling;Dynamic scheduling;Statistics;Sociology","Humans;Heuristics;Algorithms","21","","57","IEEE","26 Aug 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It is a revolution for Internet, computing and communication. Further extensions of IoT, Social Internet of Things (SIoT) provides a platform for people posting messages and photos, sharing knowledge, and connecting with each other. It is effective and efficient for people to manage their interpersonal relations through SIoT, but produces stress and tension issue coincidentally. Therefore, this study explores how users share knowledge through assessment and response under stress cognition. Three demand appraisals and three coping strategies are proposed to discuss user's behaviour on knowledge sharing, and Smart-PLS is used to test the conceptual framework. Results show that self-protection, anxiety, and avoidance increase when members of the community are threatened or injured.

"iASK: A Distributed Q&A System Incorporating Social Community and Global Collective Intelligence","G. Liu; H.

Recent research efforts begin to study social-based Q&A systems that rely on an asker's social friends to provide answers. However, this method cannot find answerers for a question not belonging to the asker's interests. To solve this problem, we propose a distributed Q&A system incorporating both social community intelligence and global collective intelligence, named as iASK. iASK improves the response latency and answer quality in both the social domain and global domain. It uses a neural network based friend ranking method to identify answerer candidates by considering social closeness and Q&A activities. To efficiently identify answerers in the global user base, iASK builds a virtual server tree that embeds the hierarchical structure of interests, and also maps users to the tree based on user interests. To accurately locate the cooperative experts, iASK has a fine-grained reputation system to evaluate user reputation based on their cooperativeness and expertise, and uses a reputation based reward strategy to encourage users to be cooperative. To further improve the performance of iASK, we propose a weak tie assisted social based potential answerer location algorithm and an interest coefficient based uncategorized question forwarding algorithm. To further improve the response quality and cooperativeness, we propose a reputation based reward strategy that motivates users to answer questions from unknown users. Experimental results from large-scale trace-driven simulation and real-world daily usages of the iASK prototype show the superior performance of iASK. It achieves high answer quality with 24 percent higher accuracy, short response latency with 53 percent less delay and effective cooperative incentives with 16 percent more answers compared to other social-based Q&A systems. The results also show the effectiveness of the enhancement algorithms in improving the performance of iASK.","1558-2183","","10.1109/TPDS.2016.2618864","U.S. NSF(grant numbers:NSF-1404981,IIS-1354123,CNS-1254006,CNS-1249603); Microsoft Research(grant numbers:8300751); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7600358","Distributed systems;question and answer systems;social networks;information search","Social network services;Servers;Delays;Search engines;Neural networks;Prototypes","","2","","44","IEEE","19 Oct 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, it still remains difficult to get a comprehensive comparison as online information is often fragmented or contradictory. To overcome these limitations, we propose the DiffTech system that exploits crowdsourced discussions from Stack Overflow, and assists technology comparison with an informative summary of different aspects. We first build a large database of comparable technologies in software engineering by mining tags in Stack Overflow. We then locate comparative sentences about comparable technologies with natural language processing methods. We further mine prominent comparison aspects by clustering similar comparative sentences and representing each cluster with its keywords and aggregate the overall opinion towards the comparable technologies.

Answers and WikiAnswers, have become popular with users as one of the central paradigms for satisfying users’ information needs. The task of question retrieval aims to answer one's query directly by finding the most relevant questions (together with their answers) from an archive of past questions. However, questions are always short text that there is a lexical gap between the queried question and the past questions. Furthermore, the underlying intents of two questions could be very different even if they bear a close lexical resemblance. To alleviate these problems, we present a hybrid approach that blends several language modelling techniques for question retrieval, namely, the Classic (query-likelihood) Language Model, the state-of-the-art Translation-based Language Model, and our proposed Semantic-based Language Model and Intent-based Language Model. The semantics of each candidate question is derived by a Probabilistic Topic Model, which makes use of local and global semantic graphs for capturing the hidden interactions among entities (e.g. people, places and concepts) in question–answer pairs. Experiments on two real-world data sets show that our approach can significantly outperform existing ones.","1460-2067","","10.1093/comjnl/bxw036","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8205856","question retrieval;language model;user intent;Semantic-based Topic Model;DBpedia","","","2","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

User-generated content from the forum StackOverflow provides rich knowledge and stories behind problems faced by web and software developers. This study explores how technical communicators engage in this knowledge-rich content specific to web and software developers. Our findings provide insights into how researchers, instructors, and practicing technical communicators might leverage user-generated forum content in their work. Literature review: Previous research examined how user-generated content is a form of technical writing and technical editing. Furthermore, some research in technical communication has examined how technical user forums present a type of user-generated content to which technical communicators might add value. However, no research on user forums has explicitly examined how technical communicators engage in user forums to gain subject-matter familiarity or expertise. This study seeks to explore how technical communication students engage in user forums to troubleshoot coding problems. Research questions: 1. Are technical communication students able to successfully solve unfamiliar coding problems using user-generated content posted on the StackOverflow website? Are they able to identify the conceptual knowledge needed to solve the coding problem? 2. When learning about new, unfamiliar technical content, how do technical communication students search for information and decide which forum content to engage with? 3. Do technical communication students make meaning and actively fill knowledge gaps when they engage in new, unfamiliar technical content on StackOverflow? 4. After searching and reading through user-generated forum content to troubleshoot a coding task, do technical communication students feel confident enough in what they learned to teach someone else? Results: Most participants were unable to solve any of the coding problems using StackOverflow. Those who did successfully troubleshoot the coding problems exhibited more active scanning when selecting a search thread and made meaning of thread content more closely. Conclusions: Actively engaging and making meaning of thread content reveals insights into the stories behind the thread. These stories provide important details and clues for gaining subject-matter familiarity, but users must actively engage in meaning-making to access the stories and fill knowledge gaps. Practitioners and instructors can leverage content on StackOverflow to better understand coding problems. StackOverflow threads, along with other user-generated forum content, also give instructors insight into technical audiences and can be leveraged to teach students how to use primary research to better understand audiences. Researchers can continue to study how novice users interact with user-generated content by investigating how confidence levels affect meaning-making.","1558-1500","","10.1109/TPC.2019.2946995","University of North Texas-College of Liberal Arts and Social Sciences; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8890765","Software development;technical communication;technical documentation;user forums;user-generated content;web development","User-generated content;Encoding;Software;Message systems;Organizations;Best practices","","","","26","IEEE","4 Nov 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this article, we aim at predicting the voting scores of questions/answers shortly after they are posted in the CQA sites. To accomplish this task, we identify three key aspects that matter with the voting of a post, i.e., the non-linear relationships between features and output, the question and answer coupling, and the dynamic fashion of data arrivals. A family of algorithms are proposed to model the above three key aspects. Some approximations and extensions are also proposed to scale up the computation.

In mediating these contradictory forces, strategic leaders need to make decisions and take actions that enable and encourage the firm to balance exploration as well as exploitation. The purpose of this study is to investigate how strategic leaders create an organization culture within which the contradictory forces for exploration and exploitation vie. Although it has been argued that strategic leadership plays a crucial role in fostering exploration and exploitation, this is the first study to empirically investigate the multiple roles that leaders need to play in creating a culture that in turn, facilitates exploration and exploitation activities in the form of incremental and radical product and process innovation. By doing so, our study contributes to our understanding of ambidexterity by identifying the multiple roles that leaders play, as well as the role organization culture plays in mediating the leadership and ambidexterity relationship. Using empirical data derived from a research study of 125 firms in Taiwan, we applied multiple regression analyses-the Sobel and Bootstrapping approach to test our hypotheses that: 1) strategic leadership directly impacts on a knowledge-sharing culture, 2) a knowledge-sharing culture directly impacts on innovation ambidexterity, and 3) organizational culture mediates the strategic leadership and innovation ambidexterity relationship.

Because such tasks are beyond the capacity of a single powerful robot, networked robotics has been widely researched. However, the modes of cooperation in traditional networked robotics have been restricted by the inherent physical constraint that all computations are performed in the robotic network, with knowledge sharing being limited to the collective storage in the network. Cloud robotics, which allows robots to benefit from the rich storage, computation, and communication resources of modern data centers, is widely accepted as a promising approach to efficient robot cooperation in applications, such as disaster management. In this paper, we study robotic cooperation in cloud robotics. We first give a conceptual view of the nature of this cooperation. We then propose three novel robotic cooperation frameworks for cloud robotics: robotic knowledge sharing cooperation, robotic physical-task cooperation, and robotic computation task cooperation.

However, knowledge sharing interoperability problems can arise when agents incorporating differing ontologies try to synchronize their internal information. Moreover, in practice, agents may not have a common or global consensus ontology that will facilitate knowledge sharing and integration of functional capabilities. We propose a method to enable agents to develop a local consensus ontology during operation time as needed. By identifying similarities in the ontologies of their peer agents, a set of agents can discover new concepts/relations and integrate them into a local consensus ontology on demand. We evaluate this method, both syntactically and semantically, when forming local consensus ontologies with and without the use of a lexical database. We also report on the effects when several factors, such as the similarity measure, the relation search level depth, and the merge order, are varied. Finally, experimenting in the domain of agent-supported Web service composition, we demonstrate how our method allows us to successfully autonomously form service-oriented local consensus ontologies.","1558-2191","","10.1109/TKDE.2005.109","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1432705","Index Terms- Ontologies in agent-based information systems;agent-mediated electronic commerce.","Ontologies;Databases;Web services;Supply chain management;Intelligent agent;Merging;Management information systems;Electronic commerce;Collaborative work;Web and internet services","","23","","35","IEEE","23 May 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Image feature learning can be considered as a multitask learning problem because different tasks may have a similar feature space. Genetic programming (GP) has been successfully applied to image feature learning for classification. However, most of the existing GP methods solve one task, independently, using sufficient training data. No multitask GP method has been developed for image feature learning. Therefore, this article develops a multitask GP approach to image feature learning for classification with limited training data. Owing to the flexible representation of GP, a new knowledge sharing mechanism based on a new individual representation is developed to allow GP to automatically learn what to share across two tasks and to improve its learning performance. The shared knowledge is encoded as a common tree, which can represent the common/general features of two tasks. With the new individual representation, each task is solved using the features extracted from a common tree and a task-specific tree representing task-specific features. To find the best common and task-specific trees, a new evolutionary search process and fitness functions are developed. The performance of the new approach is examined on six multitask learning problems of 12 image classification datasets with limited training data and compared with 17 competitive methods. The experimental results show that the new approach outperforms these comparison methods in almost all the comparisons. Further analysis reveals that the new approach learns simple yet effective common trees with high effectiveness and transferability.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2021.3097043","Marsden Fund of New Zealand Government(grant numbers:VUW1913,VUW1914); Science for Technological Innovation Challenge (SfTI) Fund(grant numbers:E3603/2903); University Research Fund at Victoria University of Wellington(grant numbers:223805/3986); MBIE Data Science SSIF Fund(grant numbers:RTVU1914); National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)(grant numbers:61876169); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9484082","Feature learning;genetic programming (GP);image classification;knowledge sharing;multitask learning","Task analysis;Feature extraction;Training;Training data;Optimization;Search problems;Genetic programming","","20","","61","IEEE","14 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We close this gap by experimentally contrasting responses to two uncertainty types central to NPD: technical and organizational uncertainty. We describe responses with respect to core engineering project activities: representation, information, and knowledge sharing. We present evidence from an experiment involving 50 professionals and 74 master's students. The results show that uncertainty type has a significant effect on activity response, and that there is a significant ordering effect within this response. Based on the identification of a new response type, change of situation, our findings show that technical uncertainty drives change of situation and representation activity, while organizational uncertainty drives information- and knowledge-sharing activities. This provides the basis for three main contributions of this article. First, we identify “change of situation” as a new type of response to uncertainty in NPD.

A general issue in this approach is the limited accuracy of ML models due to the lack of real data for training the models. Although the training dataset can be complemented with data from lab experiments and simulation, it is probable that once in operation, events not considered during the training phase appear and thus lead to model inaccuracies. A feasible solution is to implement self-learning approaches, where model inaccuracies are used to re-train the models in the field and to spread such data for training models being used for devices of the same type in other nodes in the network. In this paper, we develop the concept of collective self-learning aiming at improving the model’s error convergence time as well as at minimizing the amount of data being shared and stored. To this end, we propose a knowledge management (KM) process and an architecture to support it. Besides knowledge usage, the KM process entails knowledge discovery, knowledge sharing, and knowledge assimilation. Specifically, knowledge sharing and assimilation are based on distributing and combining ML models, so specific methods are proposed for combining models. Two use cases are used to evaluate the proposed KM architecture and methods. Exhaustive simulation results show that model-based KM provides the best error convergence time with reduced data being shared.","1943-0639","","10.1364/JOCN.12.000A70","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8882191","","Data models;Training;Optical fiber networks;Knowledge engineering;Predictive models;Adaptive optics;Decision making","","6","","","","24 Oct 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

"Research Article The Role of Leadership and Contextualization on Citizenship Behaviors in Distributed Teams: A Relational Capital Perspective","X. Sha; K. T.

We address the following research questions: (1) What is the role of inspirational leadership in cultivating relational capital (i.e., reciprocity and commitment) in distributed teams? (2) Are team members' citizenship behaviors (i.e., knowledge sharing and interpersonal helping) influenced by relational capital in distributed teams? (3) How does technology support for cognitive and affective contextualization facilitate leaders to improve organizational communication? Literature review: The purpose of the review was to provide a theoretical background for the variables in this study. Based on the relevant theories on relational capital, leadership, organizational citizenship behavior (OCB) and contextualization, this study reviewed how previous studies link these theories to one other, and proposed the positive relationship between leadership, relational capital and OCBs, as well as the moderating relationships of technology support for contextualization. Methodology: The researchers conducted a quantitative survey with 141 respondents in a major university in Asia. The subjects were part-time graduate students pursuing their master's degree. Researchers administrated a paper-based questionnaire along with a cover letter explaining the study's objectives. Responses indicating teams that were situated in only one location and their role as team leaders were removed from the analyses. Participation was completely voluntary. The researchers chose partial least squares to test the hypotheses since it has fewer restrictive assumptions and its ability for analyzing measurement and structural models. Results and discussion: This study highlights the importance of inspirational leaders in cultivating two kinds of relational capital, namely commitment and reciprocity. This study also explores the differential values of contextual information from the cognitive and affective dimensions. A key result is that the effect of inspirational leadership on reciprocity is strengthened when there is technology support for cognitive contextualization. At the same time, technology support for affective contextualization has a direct impact on commitment. These findings provide empirical support for affective and cognitive contextualization in distributed organizational communication, and suggest a way for distinguishing between reciprocity and commitment. This study concludes by illustrating the positive effects of commitment on citizenship behaviors, such as knowledge sharing and interpersonal helping. The implication of this study is that when teams are physically dispersed, there should be more emphasis on leadership with inspirational attributes to get their team members to perform beyond standard requirements. In addition, this study provides leaders and organizations with an opportunity to reflect on the appropriate technology that can be adopted to compensate for insufficient communication. The limitation of this study is that each respondent represents his/her working team. As a result, it may introduce bias to the findings. In addition, self-reported measures may also cause common method bias. Future research could consider the addition of objective measures and longitudinal work to reduce the possibility of common method bias, and investigate how work behaviors change over time.","1558-1500","","10.1109/TPC.2012.2188595","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6179567","Contextualization;distributed teams;leadership;organizational citizenship;relational capital","Social network services;Uncertainty;Context modeling;History","","5","","72","IEEE","6 Apr 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Previous studies mainly focus on training stage optimization and improve positive knowledge transfer among languages with different levels of parameter sharing, but ignore the multilingual knowledge transfer during inference although the translation in one language may help the generation of other languages. This work enhances knowledge sharing among multiple target languages in the inference phase. To achieve this, we propose a synchronous inference method that can simultaneously generate translations in multiple languages. During generation, the model that predicts the next word of each language not only based on source sentence and previously predicted segments, but also based on predicted words of other target languages. To maximize the inference stage knowledge sharing, we design a cross-lingual attention module which allows the model to dynamically selects the most relevant information from multiple target languages. The synchronous inference model requires multi-way parallel training data which is scarce. We therefore propose to adopt multi-task learning to incorporate large-scale bilingual data. We evaluate our method on three multilingual translation datasets and prove that the proposed method significantly improve the translation quality and the decoding efficiency compared to strong bilingual and multilingual baselines.","2329-9304","","10.1109/TASLP.2022.3178241","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62122088,U1836221,62006224); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9783207","Multilingualism;neural machine translation;synchronous inference","Interference;Array signal processing;Noise reduction;Attenuation;Sensors;Sensor arrays;Speech processing","","3","","49","IEEE","27 May 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In MTL, a major challenge springs from the phenomenon that sharing the knowledge with dissimilar and hard tasks, known as negative transfer, often results in a worsened performance. Though a substantial amount of studies have been carried out against the negative transfer, most of the existing methods only model the transfer relationship as task correlations, with the transfer across features and tasks left unconsidered. Different from the existing methods, our goal is to alleviate negative transfer collaboratively across features and tasks. To this end, we propose a novel multi-task learning method called task-feature collaborative learning (TFCL). Specifically, we first propose a base model with a heterogeneous block-diagonal structure regularizer to leverage the collaborative grouping of features and tasks and suppressing inter-group knowledge sharing. We then propose an optimization method for the model. Extensive theoretical analysis shows that our proposed method has the following benefits: (a) it enjoys the global convergence property and (b) it provides a block-diagonal structure recovery guarantee. As a practical extension, we extend the base model by allowing overlapping features and differentiating the hard tasks. We further apply it to the personalized attribute prediction problem with fine-grained modeling of user behaviors. Finally, experimental results on both simulated dataset and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2020.2991344","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2018AAA0102003); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61620106009,U1636214,U1736219,61971016,61931008,61836002,61672514,61976202); Key Research Program of Frontier Sciences, CAS(grant numbers:QYZDJ-SSW-SYS013); Strategic Priority Research Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences(grant numbers:XDB28000000); Natural Science Foundation of Beijing Municipality(grant numbers:4182079); Youth Innovation Promotion Association of the Chinese Academy of Sciences; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9082165","Block diagonal structural learning;negative transfer;multi-task learning;global convergence","Task analysis;Convergence;Predictive models;Diseases;Collaborative work;Optimization;Training","Algorithms;Interdisciplinary Placement;Learning;Machine Learning","2","","64","IEEE","29 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Therefore, we develop a new measure for the proximity at the institutional level that measures the link strength between researchers’ affiliated institutions. Moreover, a multilevel profile-based approach is proposed to identify the most suitable expert for research collaboration by integrating research relevance information, individual social network information and institutional connectivity information. The proposed approach has been implemented in ScholarMate, which is a research 2.0 innovation, promoting knowledge-sharing activities in the virtual scientific community.

Organizations are adopting this technological advent and increasingly crowdsourcing their tasks to the unknown individuals. However, in the context of competitive crowdsourcing software development (CCSD), crowdsourcing is still unexplored. Too little is presently known about what intricate developers to participate in crowdsourcing software development competitions. Most importantly, what kind of developers are more likely to participate? Such open questions remain to be explored. To this end, in this paper, we present the results of an empirical study conducted to investigate what motivates software developers to participate in CCSD and what inhibits software developers to participate in such competitions. An online questionnaire is sent out to more than 300 crowdsource software participants, of which 113 return valid responses. It is also sent to more than 150 industry practitioners, of which 75 return valid responses. The results suggest that the monetary rewards are not significantly important to motivate software developers to participate in CCSD. Instead, learning, social contacts, and peer recognition are more important. Besides the survey, we also analyze the historical data collected from one of the most popular software crowdsourcing platforms. The analysis results reveal that the Pareto principle holds for CCSD as well, and 0.9% of the participants win 86% competitions. The results support the premise that CCSD market is still at an early stage. Most of the professional software engineers do not participate seriously in crowdsourcing software development. Therefore, many crowdsourced tasks, especially complex tasks, may fail to receive any satisfying submission. These findings are worthwhile for the crowdsourcing platforms and companies who want to outsource their software development tasks to the CCSD platforms.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2915604","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61690205,61772071); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8709685","Crowdsourcing;motivation;inhibiting factors;competitive software development","Crowdsourcing;Task analysis;Open source software;Data mining;History;Psychology","","11","","61","OAPA","8 May 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

At the heart of every chatbot is a Natural Language Understanding (NLU) component that enables the chatbot to understand natural language input. Recently, many NLU platforms were provided to serve as an off-the-shelf NLU component for chatbots, however, selecting the best NLU for Software Engineering chatbots remains an open challenge. Therefore, in this paper, we evaluate four of the most commonly used NLUs, namely IBM Watson, Google Dialogflow, Rasa, and Microsoft LUIS to shed light on which NLU should be used in Software Engineering based chatbots. Specifically, we examine the NLUs’ performance in classifying intents, confidence scores stability, and extracting entities. To evaluate the NLUs, we use two datasets that reflect two common tasks performed by Software Engineering practitioners, 1) the task of chatting with the chatbot to ask questions about software repositories 2) the task of asking development questions on Q&A forums (e.g., Stack Overflow). According to our findings, IBM Watson is the best performing NLU when considering the three aspects (intents classification, confidence scores, and entity extraction). However, the results from each individual aspect show that, in intents classification, IBM Watson performs the best with an F1-measure$>$>84%, but in confidence scores, Rasa comes on top with a median confidence score higher than 0.91. Our results also show that all NLUs, except for Dialogflow, generally provide trustable confidence scores. For entity extraction, Microsoft LUIS and IBM Watson outperform other NLUs in the two SE tasks. Our results provide guidance to software engineering practitioners when deciding which NLU to use in their chatbots.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2021.3078384","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9426404","Software chatbots;natural language understanding platforms;empirical software engineering","Chatbot;Task analysis;Software engineering;Software;Feature extraction;XML;Java","","45","","86","IEEE","7 May 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Instead of using code search engines, software developers usually post related programming questions on online Q&A forums (e.g., Stack Overflow). One possible reason is that existing code search engines would return effective code examples only if a query contains identifiers (e.g., class or method names). In other words, existing code search engines do not handle natural-language queries well (e.g., a description of a programming task). However, developers may not know the appropriate identifiers at the time of the search. As the demand of searching code examples is increasing, it is of significant interest to enhance code search engines. We conjecture that expanding natural-language queries with their semantically related identifiers has a great potential to enhance code search engines. In this paper, we propose an automated approach to find identifiers (in particular API class-names) that are semantically related to a given natural-language query. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach using 74 queries on a corpus of 23,677,216 code snippets that are extracted from 24,666 open source Java projects. The results show that our approach can effectively recommend semantically related API class-names to expand the original natural-language queries. For instance, our approach successfully retrieves relevant code examples in the top 10 retrieved results for 76 percent of 74 queries, while it is 36 percent when using the original natural-language query; and the median rank of the first relevant code example is increased from 22 to 7.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2017.2750682","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8031055","Query expansion;code search;neural network language model;API class-name","Search engines;Programming;Java;Software engineering;IEEE transactions;Software;Joining processes","","32","","46","IEEE","11 Sep 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Analyzing and understanding those discussions could provide insights about the topics of interest to practitioners, and help the software development and research communities better understand the needs and challenges facing developers as they work in this new domain. Prior studies propose the use of LDA to study the Stack Exchange discussions. However, a simplistic use of LDA would capture the topics in discussions blindly without keeping in mind the variety of the dataset and domain-specific concepts. Specifically, LDA is biased towards larger sized corpora; and LDA-derived topics are not linked to higher level domain-specific concepts. We propose an approach that combines balanced LDA (which ensures that the topics are balanced across a domain) with the reference architecture of a domain to capture and compare the popularity and impact of discussion topics across the Stack Exchange communities. Popularity measures the distribution of interest in discussions, and impact gauges the trend of popularity over time. We made a number of interesting observations, including: (1) Bitcoin, Ethereum, Hyperledger Fabric and Corda are the four most commonly-discussed blockchain platforms on the Stack Exchange communities. (2) A broad range of topics are discussed across the various platforms of distinct layers in our derived reference architecture. (3) The Application layer topics exhibit the highest popularity (33.2 percent) and fastest growth in topic impact since November 2015. (4) The Application, API, Consensus and Network layer topics are discussed across the studied blockchain platforms, but exhibit different distributions in popularity. (5) The impact of architectural layer topics exhibits an upward trend, but is growing at different speeds across the studied blockchain platforms.

In particular, as a widely recognized language model, the self-attention model computes the similarity between the specific word and the whole sets of words in the same sentence and generates new semantic representation through the similarity-weighted summation of semantic representations of the whole words. However, the self-attention operation entirely considers all the signals with a weighted sum operation, which disperses the distribution of attention, which may result in overlooking the relation of neighboring signals. This issue becomes serious when applying the self-attention model to online community question answering platforms because of the varied length of the user-generated questions and answers. To address this problem, we introduce an attention mechanism enhanced local self-attention (LSA), which restricts the range of original self-attention by a local window mechanism, thereby scaling linearly when increasing the sequence length. Furthermore, we propose stacking multiple LSA layers to model the relationship of multiscale  $n$ -gram features. It captures the word-to-word relationship in the first layer and then captures the chunk-to-chunk (such as lexical  $n$ -gram phrases) relationship in its deeper layers.

Based on the evolution trends, the reputation updating mechanism (RUMG) is proposed to address free-riding and false-reporting problems. According to spatio-temporal privacy preserving, the incentive mechanism with spatio-temporal privacy preserving for mobile crowdsourcing is researched.

Although current graph-based truth-inference methods achieve remarkable success by capturing complex crowdsourcing relationships, they typically suffer from two challenges: 1) They fail to obtain complete crowdsourcing relationships because of the structural limitations of crowdsourcing relationship graphs; 2) Their vector initialization methods for objects and sources are disturbed by claim noise, which limits them from obtaining correct object and source semantics. To cope with these challenges, we propose a novel Truth-Inference method via Reliability Aggregation (TIRA) on an object-source graph. Specifically, we propose a hierarchical graph auto-encoder to adapt to a reasonable object-source graph, which enables TIRA to capture complete crowdsourcing relationships from multiple perspectives. To better guide TIRA, we design a vector initialization method based on source reliabilities to map the denoised claims to a representation space of objects and sources. Finally, TIRA aggregates the reliability information on an object-source graph to generate object embeddings for truth inference. We conducted extensive experiments on 12 real-world datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms 12 state-of-the-art baselines in terms of the $accuracy$accuracy and $weighted\_{F}1$weighted_F1.","1558-2191","","10.1109/TKDE.2022.3225308","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2018YFC1603601); University of the Ministry of Education(grant numbers:IRT_17R32); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62120106008); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9965593","Crowdsourcing;hierarchical graph auto-encoder;reliability aggregation;truth inference","Crowdsourcing;Reliability engineering;Representation learning;Estimation;Semantics;Behavioral sciences;Task analysis","","3","","60","IEEE","29 Nov 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, with the increase in user data leakage incidents, the existing task assignment methods are no longer sufficient to meet the privacy requirements of users. In the existing VANET-based spatial crowdsourcing, task assignments are usually performed by a trusted third party based on the real locations of tasks and drivers (task performers), which may lead to the leakage of the users' locations. Furthermore, the drivers usually prefer to query the nearest tasks to them in a geometric range, at this point sending query requests to remote crowdsourcing servers increases unnecessary response delays. To assign tasks securely and efficiently, we propose a privacy-preserving task assignment scheme based on OT and edge computing (PriTAEC), which is the first to apply Oblivious Transfer (OT) and edge computing to preserve the location privacy of VANET-based spatial crowdsourcing. In the scheme, we first utilize Hilbert Curve and Bloom Filter to implement location range queries. Then, we use geohash location encoding and Oblivious Transfer to achieve fine-grained location matching. In particular, we design a task assignment algorithm with an offline-online phase to improve the efficiency of task assignments.

The BF traits are indicators of personality and are said to be an effective predictor of study performance in various occupations. BF can be used in crowdsourcing to predict crowd workers' performance; however, it will be difficult to use in practice for two reasons like the time-and-effort issue and the bias issue. In this study, an empirical analysis is conducted on crowdsourcing to examine if TIPI-J can solve those issues. Design/methodology/approach – To investigate the issues, two tasks are posted on a crowdsourcing provider. Both TIPI-J and full version BF are conducted before and after selecting crowd workers. Structural validity and convergence validity are tested with correlation analysis between before (TIPI-J) and after (full version BF) data to examine the bias issue. Additionally, those correlations are compared with previous study and significances are examined. Findings – The correlations in “conscientiousness” is 0.45-0.50, respectively, compared with a previous study, those two correlations did not show significance. This indicates that no clear bias exists. Originality/value – This is the first research to investigate the efficacy of TIPI-J on crowdsourcing and showed that TIPI-J can be a useful tool for predicting crowd workers' performance and thus it can help to select appropriate crowd workers.","2398-7294","","10.1108/IJCS-11-2019-0031","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9826662","Human resource;Quality evaluation;Work performance;Crowdsourcing;Big five;Task assignment","Crowdsourcing;Correlation;Focusing;Estimation;Regression analysis;Resource management;Reliability","","","","36","","11 Jul 2022","","","TUP","TUP Journals"

Neural Networks (NN) models for parsing semantics provide the possibility of end-to-end duplicate question detection. Whereas, due to lack of domain data and expertise, NN models for semantic parsing are rarely directly applied to CQA duplicate question detection. This paper proposes a Semantic Matching Model (SMM) integrated with the multi-task transfer learning framework for multi-domain forum duplicate question detection. By designing the word-to-sentence interaction mechanism based on the word-to-word interaction, SMM can automatically choose to ignore or pay attention to potential similar words according to the semantics at the sentence level.

In this paper, we propose a scheme that is able to enrich textual answers in cQA with appropriate media data. Our scheme consists of three components: answer medium selection, query generation for multimedia search, and multimedia data selection and presentation. This approach automatically determines which type of media information should be added for a textual answer. It then automatically collects data from the web to enrich the answer. By processing a large set of QA pairs and adding them to a pool, our approach can enable a novel multimedia question answering (MMQA) approach as users can find multimedia answers by matching their questions with those in the pool. Different from a lot of MMQA research efforts that attempt to directly answer questions with image and video data, our approach is built based on community-contributed textual answers and thus it is able to deal with more complex questions.

The answer is not clear, since to the best of our knowledge, we have not seen any work related to this problem despite of its significance. In this study, we investigate the popular unsupervised and supervised term-weighting methods for question categorization. At the same time, we propose three new supervised term-weighting methods, namely, gf* icf, igf* gf* icf, and vrf. Comparisons of them with existing unsupervised and supervised term weighting methods are made through a series of experiments on question collections of Yahoo! Answers. The experimental results show that igf* gf* icf achieves the best performance among all term-weighting methods, while gf*icf and vrf are also competitive for question categorization.

Collaborative analysis technology can analyze multiple hyperspectral datasets to explore the inherent spectral features shared among them. In this letter, a multiple datasets collaborative analysis framework for hyperspectral band selection is proposed to realize spectral information communication, thereby guiding and promoting the band selection of each dataset. Different band selection tasks are established pertinently, and then, the evolutionary multitasking band selection method is designed to facilitate the knowledge sharing of different band selection tasks. More importantly, the interaction mechanism among different datasets is adjusted dynamically, thereby improving the cooperation ability of the collaborative analysis framework.

Our system not only collects and disseminates basic information, such as parking hours and price, but also provides drivers with information on the real time and future availability of parking spaces based on aggregated crowd knowledge. To improve the reliability of the information being disseminated, we dynamically evaluate the knowledge of crowd workers based on the veracity of their answers to a series of location-dependent point of interest control questions. We propose a logistic regression-based method to evaluate the reliability of crowd knowledge for real-time parking space information. In addition, a joint probabilistic estimator is employed to infer the future availability of parking spaces based on crowdsensed knowledge. Moreover, to incentivise wider participation of crowd workers, a reliability-based incentivisation method is proposed to reward workers according to their reliability and expertise levels. The efficacy of ParkCrowd for aggregation and the dissemination of parking space information has been evaluated in both real-world tests and simulations.

The fact that expert tasks are being outsourced to non-expert users may lead to noisy annotations introducing disagreement between users. Despite being a valuable resource for learning annotation models from crowdsourcing, conventional machine-learning methods may have difficulties dealing with noisy annotations during training. In this manuscript, we present a new concept for learning from crowds that handle data aggregation directly as part of the learning process of the convolutional neural network (CNN) via additional crowdsourcing layer (AggNet). Besides, we present an experimental study on learning from crowds designed to answer the following questions. 1) Can deep CNN be trained with data collected from crowdsourcing? 2) How to adapt the CNN to train on multiple types of annotation datasets (ground truth and crowd-based)? 3) How does the choice of annotation and aggregation affect the accuracy? Our experimental setup involved Annot8, a self-implemented web-platform based on Crowdflower API realizing image annotation tasks for a publicly available biomedical image database. Our results give valuable insights into the functionality of deep CNN learning from crowd annotations and prove the necessity of data aggregation integration.","1558-254X","","10.1109/TMI.2016.2528120","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7405343","Aggregation;crowdsourcing;deep learning;gamification;online learning","Biomedical imaging;Crowdsourcing;Noise measurement;Machine learning;Computational modeling;Robustness;Data models","Breast Neoplasms;Crowdsourcing;Female;Histocytochemistry;Humans;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Internet;Machine Learning;Mitosis;Neural Networks (Computer);Video Games","438","8","38","OAPA","11 Feb 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Extended from single-label crowdsourcing methods, NAM models the crowds' expertise on individual labels, but based on the idea that for rational workers, their annotations for instances similar in the feature space should also be similar, NAM utilizes information from the feature space and incorporates the local influence of neighborhoods' annotations. Noting that the crowds tend to act in an effort-saving manner while labeling multiple labels, i.e., rather than carefully annotating every proper label, they would prefer scanning and tagging a few most relevant labels, RAM models the crowds' expertise as their ability to distinguish the relevance between label pairs. In the second scenario, we care about cost-efficient crowdsourcing where the labeling and learning process are conducted in tandem. We extend NAM/RAM to the active paradigm and propose instance, label, and worker selection criteria such that the labeling cost is significantly saved compared to passive learning without labeling control.

In this work, we propose a novel annotation workflow that leverages the efficiency of crowdsourcing weak labels, and uses a high number of annotators to produce reliable and objective strong labels. The weak labels are collected in a highly redundant setup, to allow reconstruction of the temporal information. To obtain reliable labels, the annotators' competence is estimated using MACE (Multi-Annotator Competence Estimation) and incorporated into the strong labels estimation through weighing of individual opinions. We show that the proposed method produces consistently reliable strong annotations not only for synthetic audio mixtures, but also for audio recordings of real everyday environments. While only a maximum 80% coincidence with the complete and correct reference annotations was obtained for synthetic data, these results are explained by an extended study of how polyphony and SNR levels affect the identification rate of the sound events by the annotators. On real data, even though the estimated annotators' competence is significantly lower and the coincidence with reference labels is under 69%, the proposed majority opinion approach produces reliable aggregated strong labels in comparison with the more difficult task of crowdsourcing directly strong labels.","2329-9304","","10.1109/TASLP.2022.3233468","Academy of Finland(grant numbers:332063); Teaching machines to listen; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10016759","Strong labels;Sound event detection;Crowdsourcing;Multi-annotator data","Annotations;Task analysis;Crowdsourcing;Estimation;Reliability;Labeling;Speech processing","","14","","37","CCBY","13 Jan 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The expertise necessary for labeling data in medical applications like pathology presents a significant challenge in developing clinical-grade tools. Crowdsourcing approaches address this challenge by collecting labels from multiple annotators with varying degrees of expertise. In recent years, multiple methods have been adapted to learn from noisy crowdsourced labels. Among them, Gaussian Processes (GPs) have achieved excellent performance due to their ability to model uncertainty. Deep Gaussian Processes (DGPs) address the limitations of GPs using multiple layers to enable the learning of more complex representations. In this work, we develop Deep Gaussian Processes for Crowdsourcing (DGPCR) to model the crowdsourcing problem with DGPs for the first time. DGPCR models the (unknown) underlying true labels, and the behavior of each annotator is modeled with a confusion matrix among classes. We use end-to-end variational inference to estimate both DGPCR parameters and annotator biases. Using annotations from 25 pathologists and medical trainees, we show that DGPCR is competitive or superior to Scalable Gaussian Processes for Crowdsourcing (SVGPCR) and other state-of-the-art deep-learning crowdsourcing methods for breast cancer classification. Also, we observe that DGPCR with noisy labels obtains better results ( $\text{F}1=81.91$ %) than GPs ( $\text{F}1=81.57$ %) and deep learning methods ( $\text{F}1=80.88$ %) with true labels curated by experts.

However, existing automatic and semi-automatic approaches are not always effective due to the variety of charts. In this paper, we introduce a crowdsourcing approach that leverages human ability to extract data from visualization charts. There are several challenges. The first is how to avoid tedious human interaction with charts and design effective crowdsourcing tasks. Second, it is challenging to evaluate worker’s quality for truth inference, because workers may not only provide inaccurate values but also misalign values to wrong data series. Third, to guarantee quality, one may assign a task to many workers, leading to a high crowdsourcing cost. To address these challenges, we design an effective crowdsourcing task scheme that splits a chart into simple micro-tasks. We introduce a novel worker quality model by considering worker’s accuracy and task difficulty. We also devise effective task assignment and early-termination mechanisms to save the cost.

Making use of crowdsourcing instead of experts in a laboratory setting is a viable alternative to reduce these costs. However, without adequate quality control the obtained labels may be less reliable. Whereas crowdsourcing reduces only the costs per annotation, another technique, active learning, aims at reducing the overall annotation costs by selecting the most important instances of the dataset and only asking for manual annotations for these selected samples. Herein, we investigate the advantages of combining crowdsourcing and different iterative active learning paradigms for audio data annotation. Further, we incorporate an annotator trustability score to further reduce the labelling effort needed and, at the same time, to achieve better classification results. In this context, we introduce a novel active learning algorithm, called Trustability-based dynamic active learning, which accumulates manual annotations in each step until a trustability-weighted agreement level of annotators is reached. Furthermore, we bring this approach into the real world and integrate it in our gamified intelligent crowdsourcing platform iHEARu-PLAY. Key experimental results on an emotion recognition task indicate that a considerable relative annotation cost reduction of up to 90.57 % can be achieved when compared with a non-intelligent annotation approach. Moreover, our proposed method reaches an unweighted average recall value of 73.71 %, while a conventional passive learning algorithm peaks at 60.03 %. Therefore, our novel approach not only efficiently reduces the manual annotation work load but also improves the classification performance.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2858931","Seventh Framework Programme(grant numbers:338164); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8418370","Audio processing;crowdsourcing;dynamic active leaning;machine learning;user trustability","Crowdsourcing;Reliability;Heuristic algorithms;Task analysis;Manuals;Labeling;Emotion recognition","","6","","63","OAPA","23 Jul 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Furthermore, to reduce users’ storage space and computational overhead, the server assignment model (SAM) is widely used, which means that crowdsourcing platforms collect sensitive information about tasks and workers, e.g., locations and interests, to perform task assignments accurately. However, in the real world, crowdsourcing platforms are not fully trustworthy and may reveal sensitive information about workers and tasks, which can reduce users’ motivation to use crowdsourcing services. Therefore, how to assign tasks efficiently and securely is still an urgent problem to be solved. In this article, we propose a privacy-preserving task assignment scheme (PPTA), in which the crowdsourcing platform efficiently implements the nearest task assignments without revealing sensitive information about tasks and workers. In PPTA, we utilize inner product functional encryption to achieve circular range queries and multikeyword queries. Considering that workers usually prefer to query the nearest tasks for reducing travel costs, we use the grid location intersection to enable the nearest task assignment. In particular, we design a SAM algorithm, which can improve task assignment rates in multitask and multiworker scenarios. In addition, our scheme can implement user accountability and user revocation, which enhances the security and practicality of the scheme. Finally, we demonstrate the privacy preservation through security theoretical proofs and show the efficiency by constructing extensive comparative experiments, which respectively illustrate the security and the effectiveness of our scheme.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2022.3199200","Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province(grant numbers:ZR2020MF056,ZR2020KF011); Henan Key Laboratory of Network Cryptography Technology(grant numbers:LNCT2021-A12); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62071280); Major Scientific and Technological Innovation Project of Shandong Province(grant numbers:2020CXGC010115); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9858100","Inner product functional encryption;privacy preservation;range query;searchable encryption (SE);task assignment","Task analysis;Encryption;Crowdsourcing;Servers;Privacy;Computational modeling;Internet of Things","","5","","34","IEEE","16 Aug 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Different models of crowdsourcing have been used depending on the nature of required outcome of the task, and have had varying levels of success to date. Microtasking is one of the lucrative models of crowdsourcing which penetrated the problem-solving strategy by facilitating the decomposition of complex tasks into short and self-contained microtasks which can be performed in few minutes. Regardless of considerable number of studies explored the kinds of microtasks, existing researches fall short when it comes to technical as well as non-technical tasks and the categorization of relevant microtasks. Thus, the aim of this research is to understand the context of microtasked related crowdsourcing and to explore the microtasks related to crowdsourced software development which exist in literature. Systematic literature review is conducted to identify the microtasking activities and expert review is conducted to validate the identified microtasking activities and their categories. The final publication sample to review the literature is composed of 42 research articles and the reviews of 4 experts are taken for validation. A total of 72 microtasking activities are found along with 11 categories. After validation applied, researchers came up with a list of 61 unique microtasking activities. This paper contributes to software industry by providing list of microtasks along with their categories which will be fruitful for researchers, microtasking platforms and their clients.

We collect and study data from crowdsourced search rank fraud jobs, and survey the capabilities and behaviors of 58 search rank fraud workers recruited from 6 crowdsourcing sites. We collect a gold standard dataset of Google Play user accounts attributed to 23 crowdsourced workers and analyze their fraudulent behaviors in the wild.

Dolos correctly identified the owners of 95 percent of fraud worker-controlled communities, and uncovered fraud workers who promoted as many as 97.5 percent of fraud apps we collected from Google Play. When evaluated on 13,087 apps (820,760 reviews), which we monitored over more than 6 months, Dolos identified 1,056 apps with suspicious reviewer groups.

To ease this analysis, in previous work we proposed Development Emails Content Analyzer (DECA), a tool based on Natural Language Parsing that classifies with high precision development emails' fragments according to their purpose. However, DECA has to be trained through a manual tagging of relevant patterns, which is often effort-intensive, error-prone and requires specific expertise in natural language parsing.

IoV simulates a large variety of crowdsourcing applications, such as Waze, Uber, and Amazon Mechanical Turk, etc. Users of these applications report the real-time traffic information to the cloud server which trains a machine learning model based on traffic information reported by users for intelligent traffic management. However, crowdsourcing application owners can easily infer users’ location information, traffic information, motor vehicle information, environmental information, etc., which raises severe sensitive personal information privacy concerns of the users. In addition, as the number of vehicles increases, the frequent communication between vehicles and the cloud server incurs unexpected amount of communication cost. To avoid the privacy threat and reduce the communication cost, in this article, we propose to integrate federated learning and local differential privacy (LDP) to facilitate the crowdsourcing applications to achieve the machine learning model. Specifically, we propose four LDP mechanisms to perturb gradients generated by vehicles. The proposed Three-Outputs mechanism introduces three different output possibilities to deliver a high accuracy when the privacy budget is small. The output possibilities of Three-Outputs can be encoded with two bits to reduce the communication cost. Besides, to maximize the performance when the privacy budget is large, an optimal piecewise mechanism (PM-OPT) is proposed. We further propose a suboptimal mechanism (PM-SUB) with a simple formula and comparable utility to PM-OPT. Then, we build a novel hybrid mechanism by combining Three-Outputs and PM-SUB. Finally, an LDP-FedSGD algorithm is proposed to coordinate the cloud server and vehicles to train the model collaboratively.

This dynamic annotation procedure fits the active learning perspective and accompanies the imbalanced multiple noisy labeling problem. This paper proposes a novel active learning framework with multiple imperfect annotators involved in crowdsourcing systems. The framework contains two core procedures: label integration and instance selection. In the label integration procedure, a positive label threshold (PLAT) algorithm is introduced to induce the class membership from the multiple noisy label set of each instance in a training set. PLAT solves the imbalanced labeling problem by dynamically adjusting the threshold for determining the class membership of an example. Furthermore, three novel instance selection strategies are proposed to adapt PLAT for improving the learning performance. These strategies are respectively based on the uncertainty derived from the multiple labels, the uncertainty derived from the learned model, and the combination method (CFI). Experimental results on 12 datasets with different underlying class distributions demonstrate that the three novel instance selection strategies significantly improve the learning performance, and CFI has the best performance when labeling behaviors exhibit different levels of imbalance in crowdsourcing systems. We also apply our methods to a real-world scenario, obtaining noisy labels from Amazon Mechanical Turk, and show that our proposed strategies achieve very high performance.","2168-2275","","10.1109/TCYB.2014.2344674","Program for Changjiang Scholars and Innovative Research Team in University (PCSIRT) of the Ministry of Education, China(grant numbers:IRT13059); National 973 Program of China(grant numbers:2013CB329604); National 863 Program of China(grant numbers:2012AA011005); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61229301); U.S. National Science Foundation (IIS-1115417); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6878424","Active learning;crowdsourcing;imbalanced learning;repeated labeling;supervised classification;Active learning;crowdsourcing;imbalanced learning;repeated labeling;supervised classification","Labeling;Noise measurement;Training;Crowdsourcing;Uncertainty;Accuracy;Measurement uncertainty","","55","","34","IEEE","14 Aug 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, the privacy concerns and the lack of motivation for the live users to help in the traffic prediction process have rendered existing crowdsourcing models inefficient. Towards this end, we present an advanced blockchain-based secure crowdsourcing model. Not only does our model ensure privacy preservation of the users, but by incorporating a revenue model, it also provides them with an incentive to participate in the traffic prediction process willingly.

However, the credibility of those detected events can be negatively impacted by unreliable participants with low-quality data. Consequently, a major challenge in mobile crowdsourcing is truth discovery, i.e., to discover true events from diverse and noisy participants’ reports. This problem is uniquely distinct from its online counterpart in that it involves uncertainties in both participants’ mobility and reliability. Decoupling these two types of uncertainties through location tracking will raise severe privacy and energy issues, whereas simply ignoring missing reports or treating them as negative reports will significantly degrade the accuracy of truth discovery. In this paper, we propose two new unsupervised models, i.e., Truth finder for Spatial Events (TSE) and Personalized Truth finder for Spatial Events (PTSE), to tackle this problem. In TSE, we model location popularity, location visit indicators, truths of events, and three-way participant reliability in a unified framework. In PTSE, we further model personal location visit tendencies. These proposed models are capable of effectively handling various types of uncertainties and automatically discovering truths without any supervision or location tracking.

Existing proposals mostly rely on infrastructural references or accurate data sources, which are restricted in terms of applicability and pervasiveness. Our proposal called SenseWit is motivated by the observation that people's behavior offers meaningful clues for location inference. The noise, ambiguity, and behavior diversity contained in the crowdsourced data, however, mean non-trivial challenges in generating high-quality floorplans. We propose: 1) a novel concept called Nail to identify featured locations in indoor space and 2) a heuristic pathlet bundling algorithm to progressively discover the internal layouts of a floorplan. We implement SenseWit and conduct real-world experiments in different spaces to demonstrate its efficacy.

To improve the quality of labels obtained from these imperfect crowdsourced workers, we usually let different workers provide labels for the same instance. Then, the true labels for all instances are estimated from these multiple noisy labels. This traditional general-purpose label aggregation process, solely relying on the collected noisy labels, cannot significantly improve the accuracy of integrated labels under a low labeling quality circumstance. This paper proposes a novel bilayer collaborative clustering (BLCC) method for the label aggregation in crowdsourcing. BLCC first generates the conceptual-level features for the instances from their multiple noisy labels and infers the initially integrated labels by performing clustering on the conceptual-level features. Then, it performs another clustering on the physical-level features to form the estimations of the true labels on the physical layer. The clustering results on both layers can facilitate in tracking the changes in the uncertainties of the instances. Finally, the initially integrated labels that are likely to be wrongly inferred on the conceptual layer can be addressed using the estimated labels on the physical layer. The clustering processes on both layers can keep providing guidance information for each other in the multiple label remedy rounds. The experimental results on 12 real-world crowdsourcing data sets show that the performance of the proposed method in terms of accuracy is better than that of the state-of-the-art methods.","2162-2388","","10.1109/TNNLS.2018.2890148","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:91846104,61603186,61728205); Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province(grant numbers:BK20160843); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(grant numbers:2017T100370,2016M590457); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8626164","Clustering;crowdsourcing;label aggregation;label noise handling;truth inference","Labeling;Crowdsourcing;Noise measurement;Feature extraction;Probabilistic logic;Reliability;Collaboration","","25","","48","IEEE","25 Jan 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Differential privacy-based paradigms have been proposed to release privacy-preserving datasets with statistical approximation. Nonetheless, most existing schemes are limited when facing highly correlated attributes, and cannot prevent privacy threats from untrusted crowdsourcing servers. To address this issue, we propose two novel solutions, namely LoCop and DR_LoCop, which guarantee local differential privacy based on the randomized response technique while synthesizing and releasing high-dimensional crowdsourced data with high data utility. Particularly, LoCop leverages copula theory to synthesize high-dimensional crowdsourced data via univariate marginal distribution and attribute dependence. Univariate marginal distribution is estimated by the Lasso-based regression algorithm from aggregated privacy-preserving bit strings. Dependencies among attributes are modeled as multivariate Gaussian copula. Based on LoCop, the enhanced solution DR_LoCop not only takes advantage of C-vine copula to reflect conditional dependencies among high-dimensional attributes, but also achieves dimension reduction. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our solutions substantially outperform the state-of-the-art techniques in terms of both data utility and computational overhead.","1939-1374","","10.1109/TSC.2019.2961092","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61572398,61802298,61772410); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8937490","High-dimensional crowdsourced data;copula functions;local differential privacy;data synthesis and release","Privacy;Differential privacy;Servers;Correlation;Crowdsourcing;Dimensionality reduction","","20","","63","IEEE","20 Dec 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It aims to automatically discover the truths from possibly conflicting crowdsourced claims. Most existing truth discovery approaches focus on categorical applications, such as image classification. They use the accuracy, i.e., rate of exactly correct claims, to capture the reliability of participants. As a consequence, they are not effective for truth discovery in quantitative applications, such as percentage annotation and object counting, where similarity rather than exact matching between crowdsourced claims and latent truths should be considered. In this paper, we propose two unsupervised Quantitative Truth Finders (QTFs) for truth discovery in quantitative crowdsourcing applications. One QTF explores an additive model and the other explores a multiplicative model to capture different relationships between crowdsourced claims and latent truths in different classes of quantitative tasks. These QTFs naturally incorporate the similarity between variables. Moreover, they use the bias and the confidence instead of the accuracy to capture participants’ abilities in quantity estimation. These QTFs are thus capable of accurately discovering quantitative truths in particular domains. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that these QTFs outperform other state-of-the-art approaches for truth discovery in quantitative crowdsourcing applications and they are also quite efficient.","1558-2191","","10.1109/TKDE.2016.2535383","U.S. ARL; U.K. Ministry of Defense(grant numbers:W911NF-06-3-0001); U.S. NSF(grant numbers:CNS-1213140); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7422085","Crowdsourcing, truth discovery;quantitative task;probabilistic graphical model;Crowdsourcing;truth discovery;quantitative task;probabilistic graphical model","Crowdsourcing;Reliability;Electronic mail;Additives;Data models;Probabilistic logic;Numerical models","","17","","38","IEEE","29 Feb 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Three sources of probabilistic transcripts are demonstrated.

Second, mismatched crowdsourcing is a recent technique in which nonspeakers of the language are asked to write what they hear, and their nonsense transcripts are decoded using noisy channel models of second-language speech perception. Third, EEG distribution coding is a new technique in which nonspeakers of the language listen to it, and their electrocortical response signals are interpreted to indicate probabilities. ASR was trained in four languages without native transcripts.

Reliability measures how likely a subject will respond to a question seriously; and regularity measures how often a human will agree with other seriously-entered responses coming from a targeted population. Crowdsourcing-based studies or experiments, which rely on human self-reported affect, pose additional challenges as compared with typical crowdsourcing studies that attempt to acquire concrete non-affective labels of objects. The reliability of participants has been massively pursued for typical non-affective crowdsourcing studies, whereas the regularity of humans in an affective experiment in its own right has not been thoroughly considered. It has been often observed that different individuals exhibit different feelings on the same test question, which does not have a sole correct response in the first place. High reliability of responses from one individual thus cannot conclusively result in high consensus across individuals. Instead, globally testing consensus of a population is of interest to investigators. Built upon the agreement multigraph among tasks and workers, our probabilistic model differentiates subject regularity from population reliability.

In this manuscript, we propose automatic APs Changed Powers Identification and Radio Map database Updating (ACIRMapU) technique based crowdsourcing for indoor localization to handle these challenges. The ACIRMapU consists of APs changed powers detection and identification, fingerprints updating, and online localization positioning algorithms. For each crowdsourcing sample, we first propose a changed APs power detection and identification algorithm. After that, we proposed a fingerprint Learning Vector Quantization (LVQ) algorithm to update indoor radio maps due to changed AP. In the online localization positioning phase, an AP feature selection is performed by the Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC) algorithm followed by the Weighted K-nearest Neighbor based on signal Euclidean distance (WKNN-SED) to estimate the target location point. We conduct extensive field measurements and experiments to investigate automatic radio map updating adaptation. Results demonstrate that the proposed ACIRmapU can outperform significant improvements over the state-of-art approaches in the changed APs powered removed, increased, and decreased, whereby the localization errors in updating the radio map have reduced more than 76.86%, 61.83%, and 36.53%, respectively.

When platforms cannot verify the quality of the workers’ solutions, the crowdsourcing problem is known as information elicitation without verification (IEWV). In an IEWV problem, a platform needs to provide incentives to motivate high-quality solutions and truthful reporting of the solutions from the workers. A common approach to solve the IEWV problem is majority voting, where each worker is rewarded according to whether his solution matches the majority’s solution. However, previous work has not considered workers with heterogeneous solution accuracy. This is unrealistic in many domains, where one would expect workers to differ in judgment, expertise, and reliability. Moreover, prior work has not considered how this heterogeneity affects a platform’s tradeoff between the quality of the workers’ solutions and the platform’s cost of achieving this. We address these gaps by studying the interactions between the mobile crowdsourcing platform and workers as a two-stage Stackelberg game. In Stage I, the platform chooses the reward level for majority voting. In Stage II, the workers decide their effort levels and reporting strategies. We show that as a worker’s solution accuracy increases, he is more likely, in equilibrium, to exert effort and truthfully report his solution. However, given a fixed total worker population, surprisingly, the platform’s payoff may decrease in the number of high-accuracy workers. We further characterize the value of knowing the workers’ solution accuracy in terms of improving the platform’s optimal reward design and maximizing its payoff. Knowing such information enables a more effective aggregation of the workers’ solutions. We further design a discriminatory reward policy to incentivize heterogeneous workers. Surprisingly, such a discriminatory policy can improve both the platform’s and the workers’ payoffs, and hence improve the social welfare.","1558-0660","","10.1109/TMC.2021.3062425","Shenzhen Institute of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics; Chinese University of Hong Kong; Beijing Institute of Technology Research Fund Program; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9364734","Mobile crowdsourcing;majority voting;incentive mechanism design;game theory","Task analysis;Sensors;Robot sensing systems;Games;Roads;Mobile computing;Crowdsensing","","10","","47","IEEE","26 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Second, we propose a probabilistic framework using Topic Models to discover prototypical impressions that are data driven, and that combine multiple facets of vloggers. Finally, we address the task of automatically predicting topic impressions using nonverbal and verbal content extracted from videos and comments. Our study of 442 YouTube vlogs and 2,210 annotations collected in Mechanical Turk supports recent literature showing the feasibility to crowdsource interpersonal human impression with comparable quality to what is reported in social psychology research, and provides insights on the interplay among human first impressions. We also show that topic models are useful to discover meaningful prototypical impressions that can be validated by humans, and that different topics can be predicted using different sources of information from vloggers’ nonverbal and verbal content, as well as comments from the audience.","1941-0077","","10.1109/TMM.2014.2346471","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6874520","Attractiveness;automatic prediction;crowdsourcing;mood;nonverbal behavior;personality;topic models;verbal content;vlogs","Crowdsourcing;Media;Mood;Blogs;Video recording;YouTube","","9","","50","IEEE","8 Aug 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Although previous studies have attempted to address the “open world” challenge of crowdsourced entity collection, they do not pay much attention to the “distribution” of the collected entities. Evidently, in many real applications, users may have distribution requirements on the collected entities, e.g., even spatial distribution when collecting points-of-interest. In this paper, we study a new research problem, distribution-aware crowdsourced entity collection (CrowdDEC): Given an expected distribution w.r.t. an attribute (e.g., region or year), it aims to collect a set of entities via crowdsourcing and minimize the difference of the entity distribution from the expected distribution. Due to the openness of crowdsourcing, the CrowdDEC problem calls for effective crowdsourcing quality control. We propose an adaptive worker selection approach to address this problem. The approach estimates underlying entity distribution of workers on-the-fly based on the collected entities. Then, it adaptively selects the best set of workers that minimizes the difference from the expected distribution. Once workers submit their answers, it adjusts the estimation of workers' underlying distributions for subsequent adaptive worker selections. We prove the hardness of the problem, and develop effective estimation techniques as well as efficient worker selection algorithms to support this approach. We deployed the proposed approach on Amazon Mechanical Turk and the experimental results on two real datasets show that the approach achieves superiority on both effectiveness and efficiency.","1558-2191","","10.1109/TKDE.2016.2611509","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61602488,61632016,61502503,61602087); 973 Program of China(grant numbers:2012CB316205); Renmin University of China(grant numbers:16XNLF02); CCF-Tencent(grant numbers:CCF-Tencent RAGR20160108); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7572151","Crowdsourcing;entity collection;sampling;distribution-aware","Crowdsourcing;Data collection;Databases;Estimation;Search problems;Fans;Knowledge based systems","","7","","39","IEEE","20 Sep 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Most crowdsourcing platforms are uncontrolled and offer freedom to customers and freelancers to choose each other. This works well for unskilled jobs (e.g., image classification) with no specific quality requirement since freelancers are functionally identical. For skilled jobs (e.g., software development) with specific quality requirements, however, this does not ensure that the maximum number of job requests is satisfied. In this paper, we determine the capacity of regulated freelance systems, in terms of maximum satisfied job requests, and propose centralized schemes that achieve capacity. To ensure decentralized operation and freedom for customers and freelancers, we propose simple schemes compatible with the operation of current crowdsourcing platforms that approximately achieve capacity. Furthermore, for settings where the number of job requests exceeds capacity, we propose a scheme that is agnostic of that information, but is optimal and fair in declining jobs without wait.","1558-2566","","10.1109/TNET.2017.2766280","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8110841","Freelance platforms;capacity;queuing;decentralized algorithms","Resource management;Crowdsourcing;IEEE transactions;Cloud computing;Information processing;C++ languages","","4","","33","IEEE","15 Nov 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Aggregation of the collected data from the crowd is one of the important steps to infer the correct answer, but the existing study seems to be limited to the single-step task. This study aims to look at multiple-step classification tasks and understand aggregation in such cases; hence, it is useful for assessing the classification quality. Design/methodology/approach – The authors present a model to capture the information of the workflow, questions and answers for both single- and multiple-question classification tasks. They propose an adapted approach on top of the classic approach so that the model can handle tasks with several multiple-choice questions in general instead of a specific domain or any specific hierarchical classifications. They evaluate their approach with three representative tasks from existing citizen science projects in which they have the gold standard created by experts. Findings – The results show that the approach can provide significant improvements to the overall classification accuracy. The authors' analysis also demonstrates that all algorithms can achieve higher accuracy for the volunteer- versus paid-generated data sets for the same task. Furthermore, the authors observed interesting patterns in the relationship between the performance of different algorithms and workflow-specific factors including the number of steps and the number of available options in each step. Originality/value – Due to the nature of crowdsourcing, aggregating the collected data is an important process to understand the quality of crowdsourcing results. Different inference algorithms have been studied for simple microtasks consisting of single questions with two or more answers. However, as classification tasks typically contain many questions, the proposed method can be applied to a wide range of tasks including both single- and multiple-question classification tasks.","2398-7294","","10.1108/IJCS-06-2019-0017","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9826653","Aggregation;Classification;Task-oriented crowdsourcing;Quality assessment;Human computation","Crowdsourcing;Atomic measurements;Adaptation models;Sufficient conditions;Correlation;Machine learning algorithms;Machine learning","","3","","64","","11 Jul 2022","","","TUP","TUP Journals"

Due to its simplicity and practicality, simultaneously learning the annotation correction mechanism and the target classifier is widely studied and applied. Existing work has improved performance from the annotator and annotation process modeling perspective. However, the instance representation, which most directly affects model training, has been neglected. In this work, we investigate contrastive representation to improve learning from crowds. Specifically, we first sample confident instances and positive pairs using the pre-trained representation and human annotations. Then, we extend the supervised contrastive loss to obtain a noise-tolerant version that supports continuous consistency between labels. After that, we leverage the learned representations to train the classifier and annotator parameters. The process is generally designed as an end-to-end framework, CrowdCons, compatible with existing crowdsourcing models. Our approach is evaluated on three real-world crowdsourcing datasets; LabelMe, CIFAR10-H and Music. The experimental results show that it can significantly improve prediction accuracy, and the case study demonstrates the robustness of the model regarding noisy annotations.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3269751","China Scholarship Council(grant numbers:CSC201706070059); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10107377","Contrastive learning;crowdsourcing;learning with noise","Annotations;Crowdsourcing;Training;Noise measurement;Data models;Task analysis;Learning systems","","2","","54","CCBYNCND","24 Apr 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We propose a CrowdFusion simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) composed of coarse-grained and fine-grained trace merging, respectively, based on the iterative closest point (ICP) SLAM and GraphSLAM. ICP SLAM is proposed to correct the relative locations and directions of crowdsourcing traces and GraphSLAM is further adopted for fine-grained pose optimization. In CrowdFusion SLAM, visible light is used to accurately detect loop closures and magnetic field to extend the coverage. According to the merged traces, we construct a radio map with visible light and WiFi fingerprints. An enhanced particle filter fusing inertial sensors, visible light, WiFi, and floor plan is designed, in which visible light fingerprinting is used to improve the accuracy and increase the resampling/rebooting efficiency. We evaluate CrowdFusion based on comprehensive experiments. The evaluation results show a mean accuracy of 0.67 m for the merged traces and 0.77 m for positioning, merely replying on crowdsourcing traces without professional calibration.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2023.3260205","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62171197); Science and Technology Development Program of Jilin Province(grant numbers:20210508059RQ); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10078252","Crowdsourcing;simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM);visible light","Simultaneous localization and mapping;Wireless fidelity;Crowdsourcing;Fingerprint recognition;Merging;Particle filters;Calibration","","1","","38","IEEE","22 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Pareto-optimal queries become more and more popular in subtle and comprehensive decision support due to the increasingly complex comparison criteria, e.g., partial orders. However, none of previous work focused on efficient crowdsourced Pareto-optimal queries over partial orders with minimum monetary cost and quality guarantee with a confidence level. In this article, we propose a cost-efficient framework to find Pareto-optimal objects with minimum monetary cost and quality guarantee with a confidence level. We first propose a dynamic-status judgment model based on Student’s $t$t-distribution, which gives a confidence interval of the judgment to ensure the quality of pairwise comparisons while minimizing the number of crowdsourcers required for each pairwise comparison. We then propose a filtering-verification scheme that takes full advantage of transitivity to avoid unnecessary crowdsourcing comparisons, which significantly reduces the number of crowdsourcing pairwise comparisons. The results of our extensive experiments demonstrate that the dynamic-status judgment model requires a small number of crowdsourcers for a pairwise comparison while maintaining the accuracy, and the filtering-verification scheme can reduce the number of pairwise comparisons by 40 percent in average.","2168-6750","","10.1109/TETC.2020.3017198","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61902040); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9170897","Crowdsourcing;pareto-optimal objects;quality;transitivity","Crowdsourcing;Probabilistic logic;Computational modeling;Pareto optimization;Human intelligence;Filtering;Cultural differences","","","","54","IEEE","18 Aug 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Natural language process (NLP) techniques can be utilized to harvest this knowledge base for software engineering tasks. However, consistent vocabulary for a concept is essential to make an effective use of these NLP techniques. Unfortunately, the same concepts are often intentionally or accidentally mentioned in many different morphological forms (such as abbreviations, synonyms and misspellings) in informal discussions. Existing techniques to deal with such morphological forms are either designed for general English or mainly resort to domain-specific lexical rules. A thesaurus, which contains software-specific terms and commonly-used morphological forms, is desirable to perform normalization for software engineering text. However, constructing this thesaurus in a manual way is a challenge task. In this paper, we propose an automatic unsupervised approach to build such a thesaurus. In particular, we first identify software-specific terms by utilizing a software-specific corpus (e.g., Stack Overflow) and a general corpus (e.g., Wikipedia). Then we infer morphological forms of software-specific terms by combining distributed word semantics, domain-specific lexical rules and transformations. Finally, we perform graph analysis on morphological relations. We evaluate the coverage and accuracy of our constructed thesaurus against community-cumulated lists of software-specific terms, abbreviations and synonyms. We also manually examine the correctness of the identified abbreviations and synonyms in our thesaurus. We demonstrate the usefulness of our constructed thesaurus by developing three applications and also verify the generality of our approach in constructing thesauruses from data sources in other domains.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2019.2940439","Monash University; National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61702041,61602267,61872263,61202006); Jiangsu Government Scholarship for Overseas Studies; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8827962","Software-specific thesaurus;natural language processing;morphological form;word embedding","Thesauri;Software engineering;Encyclopedias;Electronic publishing;Internet;Natural language processing","","33","","68","IEEE","10 Sep 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
