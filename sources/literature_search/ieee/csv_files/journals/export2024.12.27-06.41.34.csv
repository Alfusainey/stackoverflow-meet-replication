"Scalable Variational Gaussian Processes for Crowdsourcing: Glitch Detection in LIGO","P. Morales-Álvarez; P. Ruiz; S. Coughlin; R. Molina; A. K. Katsaggelos","Department of Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence, University of Granada, Granada, Spain; Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL, USA; Center for Interdisciplinary Exploration and Research in Astrophysics (CIERA), Northwestern University, Evanston, IL, USA; Department of Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence, University of Granada, Granada, Spain; Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL, USA",IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence,"3 Feb 2022","2022","44","3","1534","1551","In the last years, crowdsourcing is transforming the way classification training sets are obtained. Instead of relying on a single expert annotator, crowdsourcing shares the labelling effort among a large number of collaborators. For instance, this is being applied in the laureate laser interferometer gravitational waves observatory (LIGO), in order to detect glitches which might hinder the identification of true gravitational-waves. The crowdsourcing scenario poses new challenging difficulties, as it has to deal with different opinions from a heterogeneous group of annotators with unknown degrees of expertise. Probabilistic methods, such as Gaussian processes (GP), have proven successful in modeling this setting. However, GPs do not scale up well to large data sets, which hampers their broad adoption in real-world problems (in particular LIGO). This has led to the very recent introduction of deep learning based crowdsourcing methods, which have become the state-of-the-art for this type of problems. However, the accurate uncertainty quantification provided by GPs has been partially sacrificed. This is an important aspect for astrophysicists in LIGO, since a glitch detection system should provide very accurate probability distributions of its predictions. In this work, we first leverage a standard sparse GP approximation (SVGP) to develop a GP-based crowdsourcing method that factorizes into mini-batches. This makes it able to cope with previously-prohibitive data sets. This first approach, which we refer to as scalable variational Gaussian processes for crowdsourcing (SVGPCR), brings back GP-based methods to a state-of-the-art level, and excels at uncertainty quantification. SVGPCR is shown to outperform deep learning based methods and previous probabilistic ones when applied to the LIGO data. Its behavior and main properties are carefully analyzed in a controlled experiment based on the MNIST data set. Moreover, recent GP inference techniques are also adapted to crowdsourcing and evaluated experimentally.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2020.3025390","Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness(grant numbers:DPI2016-77869-C2-2-R); Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovación(grant numbers:PID2019-105142RB-C22); National Science Foundation(grant numbers:INSPIRE 15-47880); U.S. Department of Energy(grant numbers:DE-NA0002520); Universidad de Granada; La Caixa Banking Foundation(grant numbers:ID 100010434); Doctoral Studies(grant numbers:LCF/BQ/ES17/11600011); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9201029","Crowdsourcing;citizen science;laser interferometer gravitational waves observatory;sparse Gaussian processes;scalability;uncertainty quantification;deep learning","Crowdsourcing;Training;Probabilistic logic;Gaussian processes;Machine learning;Uncertainty;Bayes methods","","12","","63","IEEE","21 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It is difficult to use a single approach to describe the process in which the number and interaction of tasks and steps of tasks are changed dynamically depending on the execution state. Motivated by modeling the collaborative business process of crowdsourcing design in complex products, a crowdsourcing hierarchical process modeling approach based on an object-oriented Petri net is proposed. From the perspective of organization and task, the crowdsourcing object interaction and design process are modeled separately. First, an organization layer modeling approach based on expert review is proposed to describe the information transfer relationship among crowdsourcing objects from the organization perspective. Then, the task layer modeling approach based on the component decomposition idea is proposed. From the perspective of the task, the task is decomposed by using a design structure matrix (DSM) and a product structure tree to model the interaction of the design process. The object-oriented Petri net-is used to realize the representation of the model. Finally, the method is verified by taking the model of the crowdsourcing design of an air cooler as an example. The model subnet is analyzed by means of an overlay tree and incidence matrix, and the reliability and robustness of the model are proven. This method provides a reference for the process modeling of the crowdsourcing design of complex products.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3065360","National Key Research and Development Project of China(grant numbers:2018YFB1700804); Youth Foundation of Ministry of Education of China(grant numbers:19YJC630141); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9374980","Crowdsourcing;process modeling;object-oriented;Petri net;design structure matrix","Object oriented modeling;Crowdsourcing;Task analysis;Petri nets;Unified modeling language;Process modeling;Organizations","","7","","44","CCBY","10 Mar 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Prior studies emphasize firm-level functional benefits, e.g., accessing larger and more diverse sets of ideas, competences, and expertise as well as reducing the costs for innovation. Inspired by the behavioral theory of the firm, we depart from such functionalist approach and develop a model that explains why and how managers in large organizations implement and design internal crowdsourcing. Drawing on a qualitative, multiple case study of five large organizations, we identify three key motives that underpin managers’ decision to implement an internal crowdsourcing platform: problem-stimulated, opportunity-driven, and legitimacy-seeking. Next, we discuss how such different motives drive managers’ decisions regarding their design of the internal crowdsourcing initiative. Broadly, our results help explain why firms continue to invest in crowdsourcing initiatives despite meager results and how managers’ cognitive frameworks impact heterogeneity in the design and implementation of crowdsourcing initiatives. This article contributes to the crowdsourcing literature by providing a more multifaceted picture of internal crowdsourcing than previous research has suggested. From a practitioners’ perspective, awareness and recognition by managers of the potential pitfalls in implementing and designing these platforms stand out as an important first step toward improving the effectiveness of internal crowdsourcing.","1558-0040","","10.1109/TEM.2020.3045118","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9335238","Crowdsourcing;decision making;innovation management;organizational aspects;technology management","Crowdsourcing;Interviews;Organizations;Technological innovation;Industries;Decision making;Search problems","","6","","64","IEEE","25 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this article, we first prove that there exist two dilemmas while tackling the above issues by using a game-theoretic approach. To overcome this challenge, we are focusing on exploiting quantum crowdsourcing schemes in which the welfare of requestor or worker can be maximized since quantum players share the extended strategy space, and the introduction of entanglement offers a new method of depicting fine-grained relations between players. Specifically, we propose a quantum game model for quota-oriented crowdsourcing game to address dilemmas in task allocation. The result indicates the dilemma based on classical strategy will disappear with the increment of entanglement degree. While in the quality-oriented crowdsourcing game, we adopt a density matrix approach to calculate the optimal payoffs of both sides, which demonstrates the superiority of our quantum strategy. Moreover, our quantum scheme is generic since it is compatible with the schemes from a classical perspective. Hence, our noteworthy quantum crowdsourcing schemes offer a promising alternative route for tackling dilemmas in crowdsourcing scenarios.","2327-4697","","10.1109/TNSE.2020.2997716","National Key R&D Program of China(grant numbers:2017YFB1002000); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61472044,61772080,61771289,61832012,61861166002); National Science Foundation(grant numbers:IIS-1741279,CNS-1704397); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9099969","Crowdsourcing;dilemma;quantum game;entanglement.","Games;Crowdsourcing;Task analysis;Game theory;Resource management;Quantum entanglement","","5","","38","IEEE","26 May 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

There is a lack of a holistic view of crowdsourcing platforms as enterprises with a developmental perspective. This study aims to address this issue by investigating business sustainability of crowdsourcing platforms. By considering temporal dimensions and multiple interpretations of business sustainability, a conceptual framework is proposed to investigate the sustainability of a crowdsourcing platform by analyzing the key business process, value co-creation, and business development, which is a major theoretical contribution of the study.

Moreover, the worker ability often varies in the process of crowdsourcing with the changing of workers’ skill, willingness, efforts, etc. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic model to characterize the quantitative crowdsourcing problem by considering the changing of worker ability so as to achieve better quality control. The dynamic worker ability is obtained with Kalman filtering and smoother.

In this paper, we investigate how the knowledge in answers becomes obsolete and identify the characteristics of such obsolete answers. We find that: 1) More than half of the obsolete answers (58.4 percent) were probably already obsolete when they were first posted. 2) When an obsolete answer is observed, only a small proportion (20.5 percent) of such answers are ever updated. 3) Answers to questions in certain tags (e.g., node.js, ajax, android, and objective-c) are more likely to become obsolete. Our findings suggest that Stack Overflow should develop mechanisms to encourage the whole community to maintain answers (to avoid obsolete answers) and answer seekers are encouraged to carefully go through all information (e.g., comments) in answer threads.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2019.2906315","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8669958","Q&A website;stack overflow;obsolete knowledge;knowledge sharing","Aging;Knowledge engineering;Message systems;Google;Computer languages;Software engineering;Security","","43","","39","IEEE","19 Mar 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, we propose a novel approach of recommending APIs for API-related questions based on API specifications and historical resolved questions (RASH). Given a new API-related question, RASH recommends APIs for it guided by two central observations. First, the more lexically similar the functional description in an API's specification is to the new question, the more likely that the API can resolve the new question. Second, the APIs that have resolved more historical similar questions can also help to resolve the new question. To verify the effectiveness of RASH, we construct and publish a corpus containing 1234 API-related questions with their correct APIs from Stack Overflow, and conduct extensive experiments over it. The experimental results show that RASH is relatively stable and robust to a different quality of questions. In addition, RASH hits nearly 70% correct APIs and outperforms the state-of-the-art approach by 15.64% when recommending 15 APIs for each question.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2777845","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61722202,61370144); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8121986","Application programming interfaces;information retrieval;recommendation system;stack overflow","Java;Correlation;Delays;Schedules;Robustness;Libraries","","19","","38","OAPA","28 Nov 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Developers around the globe are actively asking a question(s) and sharing solutions to the problems related to software development on Stack Overflow (SO). The knowledge shared by developers on SO contains useful information related to software development such as feature requests (functional/non-functional), code snippets, reporting bugs or sentiments. Extracting the NFRs shared by iOS developers on programming Q&A website SO has become a challenge and a less researched area. Objective: To identify and understand the real problems, needs, trends, and the critical NFRs or quality requirements discussed on Stack Overflow related to iOS mobile application development. Method: We extracted and used only the iOS posts data of SO. We applied the well-known statistical topical model Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to identify the main topics in iOS posts on SO. Then, we labeled the extracted topics with quality requirements or NFRs by using the wordlists to assess the trend, evolution, hot and unresolved NFRs in all iOS discussions. Results: Our findings revealed that the highly frequent topics the iOS developers discussed are related to usability, reliability, and functionality followed by efficiency. Interestingly, the most problematic areas unresolved are also usability, reliability, and functionality though followed by portability. Besides, the evolution trend of each of the six different quality requirements or NFRs over time is depicted through comprehensive visualization.

Very few studies focused on the challenges that practitioners face when refactoring software systems and what should be the current refactoring research focus from the developers’ perspective. Without such knowledge, tool builders invest in the wrong direction, and researchers miss many opportunities for improving the practice of refactoring. In this paper, we collected data from the popular online Q&A site, Stack Overflow, and analyzed posts to identify what do developers ask about refactoring. We clustered these questions to find the different refactoring related topics using one of the most popular topic modeling algorithms, Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). We found that developers are asking about design patterns, design and user interface refactoring, web services, parallel programming, and mobile apps. We also identified what popular refactoring challenges are the most difficult and the current important topics and questions related to refactoring. Moreover, we discovered gaps between existing research on refactoring and the challenges developers face. To the best of our knowledge, this paper represents the first Stack Overflow study to identify the refactoring topics discussed by developers.

To further leverage the superiority of combining blockchain and crowdsourcing, in this article, we propose an innovative hybrid blockchain crowdsourcing platform, named zkCrowd.

One key feature of supporting a pleasant/excellent service is the access to adequate and comprehensive data, which can be obtained by mobile crowdsourcing. The main challenge in crowdsourcing is how the service provider (principal) incentivizes a large group of mobile users to participate. In this paper, we investigate the problem of designing a crowdsourcing tournament to maximize the principal's utility in crowdsourcing and provide continuous incentives for users by rewarding them based on the rank achieved. First, we model the user's utility of reward from achieving one of the winning ranks in the tournament. Then, the utility maximization problem of the principal is formulated, under the constraint that the user maximizes its own utility by choosing the optimal effort in the crowdsourcing tournament. Finally, we present numerical results to show the parameters' impact on the tournament design and compare the system performance under the different proposed incentive mechanisms. We show that by using the tournament, the principal successfully maximizes the utilities, and users obtain the continuous incentives to participate in the crowdsourcing activity.","1558-0008","","10.1109/JSAC.2017.2680798","U.S. National Science Foundation(grant numbers:CNS-1343361,CNS-1350230 (CAREER),CNS-1350230); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7875128","Mobile crowdsourcing;incentive mechanism;contract theory;moral hazard;tournament","Crowdsourcing;Electric shock;Contracts;Mobile communication;Electronic mail;Measurement errors;Numerical models","","64","","34","IEEE","9 Mar 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Declarative crowdsourcing is designed to hide the complexities and relieve the user of the burden of dealing with the crowd. The user is only required to submit an SQL-like query and the system takes the responsibility of compiling the query, generating the execution plan and evaluating in the crowdsourcing marketplace. A given query can have many alternative execution plans and the difference in crowdsourcing cost between the best and the worst plans may be several orders of magnitude. Therefore, as in relational database systems, query optimization is important to crowdsourcing systems that provide declarative query interfaces. In this paper, we propose CrowdOp, a cost-based query optimization approach for declarative crowdsourcing systems. CrowdOp considers both cost and latency in query optimization objectives and generates query plans that provide a good balance between the cost and latency. We develop efficient algorithms in the  CrowdOp for optimizing three types of queries: selection queries, join queries, and complex selection-join queries.

Coding theory based techniques also allow us to pose easy-to-answer binary questions to the crowd workers. We consider three different crowdsourcing models: systems with independent crowd workers, systems with peer-dependent reward schemes, and systems where workers have common sources of information. For each of these models, we analyze classification performance with the proposed coding-based scheme. We develop an ordering principle for the quality of crowds and describe how system performance changes with the quality of the crowd. We also show that pairing among workers and diversification of the questions help in improving system performance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed coding-based scheme using both simulated data and real datasets from Amazon Mechanical Turk, a crowdsourcing microtask platform. Results suggest that use of good codes may improve the performance of the crowdsourcing task over typical majority-voting approaches.","1941-0484","","10.1109/JSTSP.2014.2316116","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6784318","Crowdsourcing;error-control codes;multi-class labeling;quality assurance","Reliability;Hamming distance;Sensors;Decoding;Nose;Vectors;Algorithm design and analysis","","40","","27","IEEE","8 Apr 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The state-of-the-art solutions attempt to address the issue from the technical perspective, which may be costly because they function as an additional procedure in crowdsourcing. In this paper, an economics based idea is adopted to embed quality control into the crowdsourcing process, where the requestor can take advantage of the market power to stimulate the workers for submitting high-quality jobs. Specifically, we employ two sequential games to model the interactions between the requestor and the workers, with one considering binary strategies while the other taking continuous strategies. Accordingly, two incentive algorithms for improving the job quality are proposed to tackle the sequential crowdsourcing dilemma problem. Both algorithms are based on a sequential zero-determinant (ZD) strategy modified from the classical ZD strategy. Such a revision not only provides a theoretical basis for designing our incentive algorithms, but also enlarges the application space of the classical ZD strategy itself. Our incentive algorithms have the following desired features: 1) they do not depend on any specific crowdsourcing scenario; 2) they leverage economics theory to train the workers to behave nicely for better job quality instead of filtering out the unprofessional workers; 3) no extra costs are incurred in a long run of crowdsourcing; and 4) fairness is realized as even the requestor (the ZD player), who dominates the game, cannot increase her utility by arbitrarily penalizing any innocent worker.","1558-2191","","10.1109/TKDE.2019.2896926","National Science Foundation(grant numbers:IIS-1741279,CNS-1704397); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:U1811463,61832012,61772080,61771289,61571049,61472044); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8632709","Crowdsourcing;quality control;sequential game;zero-determinant strategies","Crowdsourcing;Games;Quality control;Task analysis;Process control;Gold;Economics","","32","","26","IEEE","1 Feb 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Each human operator publishes small HITs (Human Intelligent Task) to the crowdsourcing platform, which consists of a set of database records and corresponding questions for human workers. The human workers complete the HITs and return the results to the crowdsourcing database for further processing. In practice, published records in HITs may contain sensitive attributes, probably causing privacy leakage so that malicious workers could link them with other public databases to reveal individual private information. Conventional privacy protection techniques, such as K-Anonymity, can be applied to partially solve the problem. However, after generalizing the data, the result of standard K-Anonymity algorithms may render uncontrollable information loss and affects the accuracy of crowdsourcing. In this paper, we first study the tradeoff between the privacy and accuracy for the human operator within data anonymization process. A probability model is proposed to estimate the lower bound and upper bound of the accuracy for general K-Anonymity approaches. We show that searching the optimal anonymity approach is NP-Hard and only heuristic approach is available. The second contribution of the paper is a general feedback-based K-Anonymity scheme. In our scheme, synthetic samples are published to the human workers, the results of which are used to guide the selection on anonymity strategies. We apply the scheme on Mondrian algorithm by adaptively cutting the dimensions based on our feedback results on the synthetic samples. We evaluate the performance of the feedback-based approach on U.S. census dataset, and show that given a predefined  $K$ , our proposal outperforms standard K-Anonymity approaches on retaining the effectiveness of crowdsourcing.","1558-2191","","10.1109/TKDE.2013.93","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6529080","Information Technology and Systems;Database Management;General;Security;integrity;and protection;General;Query design and implementation languages;Crowdsourcing;K-Anonymity;database privacy;data partition","Crowdsourcing;Databases;Accuracy;Privacy;Upper bound;Engines;Data privacy","","27","","28","IEEE","11 Jun 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, few studies have applied machine learning methods to crowdsourcing, a form of service e-commerce, to evaluate the reputation of participants. This paper proposes a reputation evaluation model (i.e. LDA-RF) for crowdsourcing participants of Random Forest based on Linear Discriminant Analysis. The model consists of five steps: firstly, building a multidimensional reputation evaluation index system for crowdsourcing participants, collecting real data sets, and preprocessing data; secondly, data dimensionality reduction methods, including Linear Discriminant Analysis, Principal Component Analysis, Mean Impact Value method and ReliefF feature selection method, are used to eliminate redundant variables; thirdly, data normalization; fourthly, with selected feature subset, five machine learning techniques, Random Forest, Decision Tree, Back propagation Neural Network, Radial Basis Function Neural Network and Support Vector Machine are used to train the model; Fifthly, the validity of the model is tested by four evaluation measures: 10 fold cross validation, confusion matrix, Kruskal-wallis test and dispersion degree. The results show that the LDA-RF model on accuracy, F1-measure, generalization ability and robustness are better than those of other models, and it has better performance and effectiveness.

For example, the initiative can fail if design solutions do not achieve the required quality, which, in turn, is influenced by factors such as domain knowledge, problem complexity, and incentive structures. Thus, there lies a need to systematically design crowdsourcing initiatives.

Consequently, incentive mechanisms specifically tailored to multimedia crowdsourcing applications need to be developed to fully utilize the potential of multimedia crowdsourcing. In this paper, we design an optimal incentive mechanism for the smartphone contributors to participate in a cloud-enabled multimedia crowdsourcing scheme. We establish a condition that determines whether the smartphones are eligible to participate, and provide a close form expression for the optimal duration of service from the contributors, for a given reward from the crowdsourcer. Consequently, we derive the conditions for existence of an optimal reward for the contributors from the crowdsourcer, and prove its uniqueness. We numerically illustrate the performance of our model considering logarithmic and linear cost functions for the cloud resources. The similarity of the results for different cost models corroborates the validity of our model and the results, whereas the difference in the magnitudes suggests that the strategy of the crowdsourcer as well as the strategies of the smartphone participants considerably depend on the cloud cost model.","1941-0077","","10.1109/TMM.2016.2604080","Research Council of Norway(grant numbers:240079/F20); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7555338","Crowdsourcing;energy consumption;multimedia cloud;quality of service;reward;utility","Multimedia communication;Crowdsourcing;Streaming media;Sensors;Mobile communication;Cloud computing","","17","","35","IEEE","29 Aug 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

As the driving force of crowdsourcing is the interaction among participants, various incentive mechanisms have been proposed to attract and retain a sufficient number of participants to provide a sustainable crowdsourcing service. However, there exist some gaps between the modeled entities or markets in the existing works and those in reality: 1) dichotomous task valuation and workers' punctuality and 2) crowdsourcing service market monopolized by a platform. To bridge those gaps of such impractical assumption, we model workers' heterogeneous punctuality behavior and task depreciation over time. Based on those models, we propose an expected social welfare maximizing (ESWM) mechanism that aims to maximize the expected social welfare (ESW) by attracting and retaining more participants in the long term, i.e., multiple rounds of crowdsourcing. In the evaluation, we modeled the continuous competition between the ESWM and one of the existing works in both short-term and long-term scenarios. The simulation results show that the ESWM mechanism achieves higher ESW and platform utility than the benchmark by attracting and retaining more participants. Moreover, we prove that the ESWM mechanism achieves the desirable economic properties: individual rationality, budget balance, computational efficiency, and truthfulness.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2019.2953278","Ministry of Science and ICT (MSIT), Korea, under the ICT Consilience Creative program(grant numbers:IITP-2019-2011-1-00783); Institute for Information & communications Technology Planning & Evaluation (IITP); National Research Foundation of Korea(grant numbers:NRF-2019R1C1C1007277); NSF CAREER Award, the United States.(grant numbers:1553385); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8897639","Crowdsourcing;distributed computing;incentive mechanism","Task analysis;Crowdsourcing;Cost accounting;Sensors;Internet of Things;Bridges","","11","","29","IEEE","13 Nov 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To address the quality of service dilemma between the crowdsourcing platform and the workers, we first present an auction-screening method to estimate the reasonable recruitment range of workers which can be optimized by the result of cos-evaluation algorithm, and then use a reward distribution method to motivate workers to complete tasks with high quality and on time.

The previous proposed taxonomic framework for charactering this process is mainly for general crowdsourcing process and summarized by empirical study. The purpose of this paper is to propose a conceptual model for crowdsourcing innovation from a cybernetic and knowledge management perspective by normative research. The authors performed a normative study and deduced five systemic characteristics from the general laws of control system that guarantee ongoing efficiency for the innovation process. The normative research results provide two key contributions. Firstly, general control laws deduce five indispensable characteristics, and they reveal the intrinsic mechanism of crowdsourcing innovation: the knowledge flow controls, which are also the connotation of open innovation. Secondly, the authors have analyzed a five-characteristics system model and tested the model in several classical cases to show the design tricks of cases. This study provides a new conceptual framework that integrates the theory of open innovation and cybernetics to provide a new view of crowdsourcing innovation process design.

Manually annotating images is arduous and expensive, especially for aerial images, which often cover a large land area with multiple labels. A recent trend for conducting such annotation tasks is through crowdsourcing, where images are annotated by volunteers or paid workers [e.g., annotation volunteers for Open Street Map (OSM)] online from scratch. However, for crowdsourcing image annotations, the quality cannot be guaranteed, and incompleteness and incorrectness are two major concerns. To address such concerns, we have a rethinking of crowdsourcing annotations: our simple hypothesis is that if annotators only partially annotate multilabel images with salient labels they are confident in, there will be fewer annotation errors and annotators will spend less time on uncertain labels. As a pleasant surprise, with the same annotation budget, we show that a multilabel aerial image classifier supervised by images with salient annotations can outperform models supervised by fully annotated images. Our contributions are twofold: an active learning way is proposed to acquire salient labels for multilabel aerial images and a novel adaptive temperature associated model (ATAM) specifically using partial annotations is proposed for multilabel aerial image classification. When tested on practical crowdsourcing aerial data, the OSM dataset, the proposed ATAM can achieve higher accuracy than state-of-the-art classification methods trained on fully annotated images. The proposed idea is promising for crowdsourcing aerial image annotation. Our code will be publicly available.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2022.3191735","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9832017","Aerial images;crowding sourcing;multilabel classification;salient labels","Annotations;Crowdsourcing;Task analysis;Training;Adaptation models;Data models;Image annotation","","5","","73","IEEE","18 Jul 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

People in the crowd then compete with each other to win the rewards. Although in real life, a crowd is usually networked and people influence each other via social ties, existing crowdsourcing contest theories do not aim to answer how interpersonal relationships influence people’s incentives and behaviors and thereby affect the crowdsourcing performance. In this work, we novelly take people’s social ties as a key factor in the modeling and designing of agents’ incentives in crowdsourcing contests. We establish two contest mechanisms by which the principal can impel the agents to invite their neighbors to contribute to the task. The first mechanism has a symmetric Bayesian Nash equilibrium, and it is very simple for agents to play and easy for the principal to predict the contest performance. The second mechanism has an asymmetric Bayesian Nash equilibrium, and agents’ behaviors in equilibrium show a vast diversity which is strongly related to their social relations. The Bayesian Nash equilibrium analysis of these new mechanisms reveals that, besides agents’ intrinsic abilities, the social relations among them also play a central role in decision-making. Moreover, we design an effective algorithm to automatically compute the Bayesian Nash equilibrium of the invitation crowdsourcing contest and further adapt it to a large graph dataset. Both theoretical and empirical results show that the new invitation crowdsourcing contests can substantially enlarge the number of participants, whereby the principal can obtain significantly better solutions without a large advertisement expenditure.","1558-2566","","10.1109/TNET.2022.3223367","National Natural Science Foundation of China (NNSFC)(grant numbers:71601029); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9967787","Crowdsourcing;social network;Bayesian game;mechanism design;contest theory;social recruiting","Crowdsourcing;Bayes methods;Games;Social networking (online);Task analysis;Nash equilibrium;Biological system modeling","","4","","44","IEEE","30 Nov 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A key metric of crowdsourcing is data accuracy, which relies on the quality of the participating workers' data (e.g., the probability that the data are equal to the ground truth). However, the data quality of a worker can be its own private information (which the worker learns, e.g., based on its location) that it may have incentive to misreport, which can, in turn, mislead the crowdsourcing requester about the accuracy of the data. This issue is further complicated by the fact that the worker can also manipulate its effort made in the crowdsourcing task and the data reported to the requester, which can also mislead the requester. In this paper, we devise truthful crowdsourcing mechanisms for quality, effort, and data elicitation (QEDE), which incentivize strategic workers to truthfully report their private worker quality and data to the requester, and make truthful effort as desired by the requester. The truthful design of the QEDE mechanisms overcomes the lack of ground truth and the coupling in the joint elicitation of the worker quality, effort, and data. Under the QEDE mechanisms, we characterize the socially optimal and the requester's optimal (RO) task assignments, and analyze their performance. We show that the RO assignment is determined by the largest “virtual quality” rather than the highest quality among workers, which depends on the worker's quality and the quality's distribution. We evaluate the QEDE mechanisms using simulations that demonstrate the truthfulness of the mechanisms and the performance of the optimal task assignments.","2325-5870","","10.1109/TCNS.2019.2905090","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8667369","Crowdsourcing","Crowdsourcing;Task analysis;Data integrity;Couplings;Control systems;Sensors;Frequency measurement","","4","","23","IEEE","14 Mar 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, the limited transmission bit rate in 4G communication network affects the experience of the users for watching videos. Crowdsourcing is considered as a reasonable and effective solution to alleviate the resource limitation. Through employing the crowdsourcing participants to download and transmit video segments, mobile users can get enhanced video services. However, it is still a significant challenge that how to avoid excessive payment and energy consumption when the crowdsourcing participants download the video segments for the mobile users. To address this challenge, a multi-objective video crowdsourcing method in mobile environment is proposed in this paper. Technically, the crowdsourcing participants apply device-to-device (D2D) communication technique rather than the cellular network or bluetooth transmission to transmit video segments to the mobile users. Here, we divide our problem into two situations, the single participant case and the multi-participants case. In the single participant case, we apply the improved dynamic programming algorithm to find strategies with more enhanced video service time that the crowdsourcing participants provide for the mobile users. Then Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) and Multiple Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) techniques are applied to find a balanced strategy to maximize the enhanced video service time and minimize the payment and the energy consumption. In the multi-participants case, through DBSCAN clustering, the problem with multi-participants is divided into several problems with single participant.

In addition, the effort compensation mechanism has been designed to improve the profits of the manufacturer and supplier, and consumer surplus. Finally, the innovativeness strategy is explored based on the manufacturer providing compensation for crowdsourcing consumers. The results show the following: 1) if the degree of preference dispersion is low, the percentage of crowdsourcing consumers is large, or the degree of knowledge spillover is high, the manufacturer prefers radical innovation. It also implies the negative relationship between the manufacturer’s profit and innovation level. Otherwise, the manufacturer prefers incremental innovation, which implies the positive correlation between the manufacturer’s profit and innovation level; 2) under the optimal product innovativeness strategy, supplier’s profit and consumer surplus also are improved; and 3) under certain conditions, offering compensation for crowdsourcing consumers is Pareto improvement strategy for the manufacturer, the supplier, and crowdsourcing consumers.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3143703","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9682703","Crowdsourcing;innovativeness strategy;knowledge spillover","Technological innovation;Crowdsourcing;Supply chains;Task analysis;Companies;Collaboration;Production","","1","","62","CCBYNCND","14 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In an educational context, crowdsourcing of learning materials– where students create resources that can be used by other learners– offers several benefits. Students benefit from the act of producing resources as well as from using the resources. Despite benefits, instructors may be hesitant to adopt crowdsourcing for several reasons, such as concerns around the quality of content produced by students and the perceptions students may have of creating resources for their peers. While prior work has explored crowdsourcing concerns within the context of individual tools, lessons that are generalisable across multiple platforms and derived from practical use can provide considerably more robust insights. In this perspective article, we present four crowdsourcing tools that we have developed and used in computing classrooms. From our previous studies and experience, we derive lessons which shed new light on some of the concerns that are typical for instructors looking to adopt such tools. We find that across multiple contexts, students are capable of generating high quality learning content which provides good coverage of key concepts. Although students do appear hesitant to engage with new kinds of activities, various types of incentives have proven effective. Finally, although studies on learning effects have shown mixed results, no negative outcomes have been observed. In light of these lessons, we hope to see a greater uptake and use of crowdsourcing in computing education.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3253642","Jenny and Antti Wihuri Foundation; Ulla Tuomisen Säätiö; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10061397","Contributing student pedagogy;crowdsourcing;crowdsourcing systems;learnersourcing","Crowdsourcing;Education;Learning systems;Task analysis;Online services;Encyclopedias;Data integrity","","","","71","CCBY","6 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In recent years, agent-based crowdsourcing approaches focusing on recommendations or incentives have emerged to dynamically match workers with diverse characteristics to tasks to achieve high collective productivity. However, existing approaches are mostly designed based on expert knowledge grounded in well-established theoretical frameworks. They often fail to leverage on user-generated data to capture the complex interaction of crowdsourcing participants' behaviours. This paper aims to address this challenge. Design/methodology/approach - The paper proposes a policy network plus reputation network (PNRN) approach which combines supervised learning and reinforcement learning to imitate human task allocation strategies which beat artificial intelligence strategies in this large-scale empirical study. The proposed approach incorporates a policy network for the selection of task allocation strategies and a reputation network for calculating the trends of worker reputation fluctuations. Then, by iteratively applying the policy network and reputation network, a multi-round allocation strategy is proposed. Findings - PNRN has been trained and evaluated using a large-scale real human task allocation strategy data set derived from the Agile Manager game with close to 500,000 decision records from 1,144 players in over 9,000 game sessions. Extensive experiments demonstrate the validity and efficiency of computational complex crowdsourcing task allocation strategy learned from human participants.

Research limitations/implications – The research contributes an architecture to the crowdsourcing body knowledge. The research also makes a methodological contribution for the development of ontologies using crowdsourcing. Practical implications – Creating ontologies is a demanding task and most ontologies are not exhaustive on the targeted domain knowledge. The proposed architecture provides a guiding structure for the engagement of online crowds in the creation and enhancement of domain ontologies. The research uses a case of taxonomic knowledge ontology.

Under this scenario, we will study an important problem, namely multi-skill spatial crowdsourcing (MS-SC), which finds an optimal worker-and-task assignment strategy, such that skills between workers and tasks match with each other, and workers’ benefits are maximized under the budget constraint. We prove that the MS-SC problem is NP-hard and intractable.

With some incentives, providers compete to furnish service requests, thus pledging the quality of experience (QoE) for requestors. However, the decentralized communication in crowdsourcing increases the probability of information tapering. Furthermore, providers' arbitrary selection of the requests poses great threat to the efficient and profitable service provision for the requestors. To deal with these challenges, we propose a blockchain-powered crowdsourcing method, named BPCM, while considering the privacy preservation in mobile environment. Specifically, a mobile crowdsourcing framework based on blockchain is designed first to preserve the privacy of the participants and keep the integrity of the service request and provision. Then, density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) and improved dynamic programming (IDP) are adopted to cluster the requestors and generate service strategies, respectively. Furthermore, simple additive weighting (SAW) and multiple criteria decision making (MCDM) are utilized to select the optimal strategy that achieves the tradeoffs among maximizing the service time, increasing the profits, and reducing the energy consumption for the providers. Finally, comprehensive experiments are conducted to verify the accuracy and effectiveness of BPCM.","2329-924X","","10.1109/TCSS.2019.2909137","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61702277,61872219,61672276); Natural Science Research of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions of China; Jiangsu Collaborative Innovation Center on Atmospheric Environment and Equipment Technology (CICAEET); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8697106","Blockchain;crowdsourcing;mobile environment;privacy preservation","Crowdsourcing;Privacy;Blockchain;Task analysis;Device-to-device communication;Data privacy;Quality of experience","","129","","42","IEEE","23 Apr 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Each volunteer worker completes assigned tasks while conducting his/her routine tasks. The system has a desired task probability coverage and budget constraint. Under this scenario, we investigate an important problem, namely heterogeneous spatial crowdsourcing task allocation (HSC-TA), which strives to search a set of representative Pareto-optimal allocation solutions for the multi-objective optimization problem, such that the assigned task coverage is maximized and incentive cost is minimized simultaneously. To accommodate the multi-constraints in heterogeneous spatial crowdsourcing, we build a worker mobility behavior prediction model to align with allocation process. We prove that the HSC-TA problem is NP-hard.

To scrutinize this difference it is considered that user intervention in crowd-based schemes can be either implicit or explicit. Since one of the most important applications of crowdsourcing and crowdsensing systems is providing location services in indoor environments, in this paper, we study the level of user contribution in available crowd-powered techniques and propose a classification for crowd-powered indoor localization solutions to clarify which crowds-based approach is utilized in each indoor localization solution because in many cases the distinction is not clear and often leads to misconception. Dependency on site survey process is considered as another distinction point in our proposed classification. Hence, we consider indoor localization solutions with implicit user participation and latent mobile utilization as crowdsensing indoor localization systems. Respectively, indoor localization solutions with explicit user participation and manifest mobile utilization are classified as crowdsourcing indoor localization systems.","1558-1748","","10.1109/JSEN.2018.2880180","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8529230","Localization;crowdsensing;crowdsourcing;indoor positioning system;IoT","Crowdsourcing;Task analysis;Intelligent sensors;Smart phones;Wireless fidelity;Indoor environments","","98","","146","IEEE","9 Nov 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

If the competence level or the “reputation,” which can be explained as the probabilities of annotating the right label, for each crowdsourcing annotators is equal and biased to annotate the right label, majority voting (MV) is the optimal decision rule for merging the multiple labels into a single reliable one. However, in practice, the competence levels of annotators employed by the crowdsourcing labeling systems are often diverse very much. In these cases, weighted MV is more preferred. The weights should be determined by the competence levels. However, since the annotators are anonymous and the ground-truth labels are usually unknown, it is hard to compute the competence levels of the annotators directly. In this paper, we propose to learn the weights for weighted MV by exploiting the expertise of annotators. Specifically, we model the domain knowledge of different annotators with different distributions and treat the crowdsourcing problem as a domain adaptation problem. The annotators provide labels to the source domains and the target domain is assumed to be associated with the ground-truth labels. The weights are obtained by matching the source domains with the target domain. Although the target-domain labels are unknown, we prove that they could be estimated under mild conditions. Both theoretical and empirical analyses verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. Large performance gains are shown for specific data sets.","2162-2388","","10.1109/TNNLS.2018.2836969","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61772455,61572486,61772508,61472168,61732005,61672271,U1713213); Yunnan Natural Science Funds(grant numbers:2016FB105); Guangdong Technology Project(grant numbers:2016B010108010,2016B010125003,2017B010110007); Shenzhen Technology Project(grant numbers:JCYJ20170413152535587,JSGG20160331185256983,JSGG20160229115709109); Program for Excellent Young Talents of Yunnan University(grant numbers:WX069051); Project of Innovative Research Team of Yunnan Province, CAS Key Technology Talent Program, Shenzhen Engineering Laboratory for 3-D Content Generating Technologies(grant numbers:[2017]476); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8372965","Crowdsourcing;domain knowledge;theoretical guarantee;weighted majority voting (MV)","Crowdsourcing;Labeling;Noise measurement;Reliability;Machine learning;Training;Task analysis","","59","","66","IEEE","5 Jun 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, existing systems rely on their separate servers to conduct recommendation services, resulting in computing resources locked inside each isolated system. Moreover, due to the wide attacking surfaces of traditional centralized servers setting, existing systems are subject to single points of failure or malicious data breaches. Therefore, failure to address these inherent limitations properly will hinder the wide adoption of crowdsourcing. In this article, we propose and implement FedCrowd, the first federated and privacy-preserving crowdsourcing platform by using blockchain technology. Our main idea is to employ the smart contract as a trusted platform for systems to release encrypted tasks, and carefully craft matching protocols to enable efficient task recommendations in the ciphertext domain. Our task-matching protocols are highly customized for the decentralized settings, where users can securely perform keyword and range-based queries over federated task indexes without sharing secret keys.

Most existing work, hence, has focused on designing efficient query task assignment schemes to maximize the task completion rate under traveling constraints of workers for spatial crowdsourcing systems. In crowdsensing, on the other hand, sensor recordings of workers' smartphones are of interest and have been collected to build various applications. Therefore, work concerning crowdsensing has strived to maximize the coverage area of sensor trajectories by selecting a set of workers. In this paper, we investigate the integration of these two paradigms. We notice a key link between these paradigms: While a worker is traveling to the target location of a query task, his trajectory may provide valuable coverage for a sensing task. Therefore, we propose a task management framework, named SpatialRecruiter, to efficiently match workers to the merged query and sensing tasks. We propose two coverage estimation functions to compute the coverage potential of a worker. Then, we design a greedy heuristic to select and assign workers.

One apparent disadvantage of such deterministic auction mechanisms is that the diversity with respect to the sensing job is reduced. As a consequence, the quality of the collected sensing data is also decreased. This is due to failure to exploit the intrinsic advantage of the large set of diverse mobile users in a mobile crowdsourcing network. In this paper, we propose a randomized combinatorial auction mechanism for the social cost minimization problem, which is proven to be NP-hard. We design an approximate task allocation algorithm that is near optimal with polynomial-time complexity and use it as a building block to construct the whole randomized auction mechanism. Compared with deterministic auction mechanisms, the proposed randomized auction mechanism increases the diversity in contributing users for a given sensing job. We carry out both solid theoretical analysis and extensive numerical studies and show that our randomized auction mechanism achieves approximate truthfulness, individual rationality, and high computational efficiency.","1558-0660","","10.1109/TMC.2017.2653774","973 Program(grant numbers:2014CB340303); 863 Program(grant numbers:2015AA015303); NSFC(grant numbers:61472254,61170238,61420106010); STCSM(grant numbers:14511107500,15DZ1100305); Young Faculty in Shenzhen Polytechnic(grant numbers:601522K30015); SZSTI(grant numbers:JCYJ20160407160609492); NRF(grant numbers:CREATE E2S2); New Century Excellent Talents in University of China; Changjiang Young Scholars in University of China; Shanghai Top Young Talents; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7819511","Mobile crowdsourcing;incentive mechanism;randomized auction;diversity;quality;truthfulness;rational;social cost","Mobile communication;Sensors;Crowdsourcing;Resource management;Smart phones;Noise level;Mobile computing","","39","","45","IEEE","16 Jan 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Nowadays, workers are often naturally organized into groups through social networks. To address such common issue of grouped workers in real crowdsourcing systems, this article explores a novel crowdsourcing paradigm in which the task allocation targets are naturally existing worker groups but not individual workers or artificially formed teams as before. Because a natural group might not possess all required skills and needs to coordinate with other groups in the social network contexts for performing a complex task, a concept of contextual crowdsourcing value is presented to measure a group's capacity to complete a task by coordinating with its contextual groups, which determines the priority that the group is assigned the task; then, the task allocation algorithms, including the allocations of groups and the workers actually participating in executing the task, are designed. The experiments on a real-world dataset show that our presented group-oriented approach can nearly always achieve better synergy performance, consistency performance, conflict performance, adaptability, and effectiveness on reducing costs, as compared with previous benchmark individual-oriented and team formation approaches.","2168-2232","","10.1109/TSMC.2019.2933327","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61932007,61472079,61806053,61807008); Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province of China(grant numbers:BK20171363,BK20180356,BK20180369); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8818337","Context-aware;crowdsourcing;group;social networks;task allocation","Task analysis;Crowdsourcing;Resource management;Social networking (online);Benchmark testing;Computer science;Coordinate measuring machines","","38","","41","IEEE","28 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Moreover, we put forward an efficient attribute revocation mechanism and a task search function in the scheme to achieve dynamic on-demand services while ensuring the forward and backward security of tasks.

In a typical crowdsourcing framework, independent workers compete to be allocated requesters' tasks. These workers advertise their costs to the centralized platform, which then decides the final allocation of tasks. While performing the allocation, centralized platforms face two main challenges: 1) how to ensure trusted execution for the allocation of tasks, and 2) how to motivate workers to declare their truthful costs. To address these challenges, ABCrowd proposes to run the crowdsourcing platform entirely on Ethereum Blockchain while incorporating auctions. Blockchain and smart contracts guarantee trusted execution for the allocation through autonomous and transparent on-Chain execution. ABCrowd uses the Repeated-Single-Minded Bidder (R-SMB) auction mechanism, which motivates workers to bid truthfully before allocating them and calculating their payments. R-SMB is an approximation of the optimized off-Chain Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) mechanism in terms of maximized profit. It entails repeating the Single-Minded Bidder (SMB) auction mechanism to meet the allocation requirement of crowdsourcing applications. ABCrowd is implemented and evaluated using Solidity on a private Ethereum Blockchain, where a real publicly available dataset is used. The proposed on-Chain R-SMB auction mechanism is compared to the off-Chain VCG mechanism, where the results show that R-SMB provides similar performance to VCG in terms of the average number of allocated tasks. Furthermore, R-SMB outperforms VCG in workers' travelled distance and requesters' costs, at a low execution cost.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2965897","Khalifa University of Science, Technology and Research(grant numbers:8474000012); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8955886","Crowdsourcing;blockchain;smart contracts;auction","Blockchain;Task analysis;Resource management;Smart contracts;Privacy;Crowdsensing","","37","","31","CCBY","10 Jan 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We study cost-effective incentive mechanisms for microtask crowdsourcing in this paper. In particular, we consider a model with strategic workers, where the primary objective of a worker is to maximize his own utility. Based on this model, we first analyze two basic mechanisms and show their limitations in collecting high-quality solutions with low cost. Then, we propose a cost-effective mechanism that employs quality-aware worker training as a tool to stimulate workers to provide high-quality solutions. We prove theoretically that the proposed mechanism can be designed to obtain high-quality solutions from workers and ensure the budget constraint of the requester at the same time. Beyond its theoretical guarantees, we further demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed mechanisms through a set of behavioral experiments.","1943-0698","","10.1109/TCIAIG.2014.2298361","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6704771","Crowdsourcing;game theory;incentive;Markov decision process;symmetric Nash equilibrium (SNE)","Training;Educational institutions;Analytical models;Distance measurement;Computational modeling;Cost function;Computers","","37","","23","IEEE","9 Jan 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, with the expansion of application scenarios, this system suffers from labor-intensive work for received signal strength (RSS) fingerprint construction. In this article, we propose a crowdsourcing-based radio map construction method and trajectory matching algorithm to solve the time-consuming preliminary fingerprint data collection in the offline phase, where the tedious collection work is replaced by the massive crowdsourcing sensor data. First, the latent information of the map is extracted by using some image processing methods, and all possible routes are obtained simultaneously with the depth-first traversal method. Then, considering the strict restrictions on walking in indoor environments, the crowdsourcing trajectories are produced by matching the result of pedestrian dead reckoning (PDR) with the candidate routes based on the Shape Context algorithm. Further, a crowdsourcing trajectory can be represented by uniformly distributed reference points based on step detection, and each point corresponds to a unique RSS of access points (APs). Since such a fingerprint construction method can be performed while smartphone holders are moving and not aware of their actual positions, it can be referred to the dynamic construction method of the radio map. The real scenario experiments reveal that the proposed solution can significantly reduce the time and manpower consumption to build the radio map. Moreover, compared with traditional schemes, our crowdsourcing-based radio map construction method for the WiFi fingerprinting localization (CRCLoc) system can improve the accuracy and robustness of the indoor-positioning results.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2021.3135700","National Key Research and Development Project(grant numbers:2019YFB2101600); Key Science and Technology Program of Shaanxi Province(grant numbers:2021GXLH-Z-038); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:xzy012019037); Open Research Fund of National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory at Southeast University(grant numbers:2020D12); National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory at Southeast University; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9651527","Crowdsourcing sensor data;floor plan;radio map;WiFi fingerprint positioning","Databases;Crowdsourcing;Trajectory;Wireless fidelity;Legged locomotion;Location awareness;Fingerprint recognition","","36","","50","IEEE","15 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

While guaranteeing the data privacy, DB-SCS can also enhance the spatial crowdsourcing performance by using the proposed DRL-based management strategy to dynamically select the consensus algorithm, block size, and block generation rule.

A service exchange dilemma arises when there is non-cooperation among self-interested users, and zero social welfare is obtained at myopic equilibrium. Traditional rating protocols are not effective to overcome the inefficiency of the socially undesirable equilibrium due to specific features of crowdsourcing: a large number of anonymous users having asymmetric service requirements, different service capabilities, and dynamically joining/leaving a crowdsourcing platform with imperfect monitoring. In this paper, we develop the first game-theoretic design of the two-sided rating protocol to stimulate cooperation among self-interested users, which consists of a recommended strategy and a rating update rule. The recommended strategy recommends a desirable behavior from three predefined plans according to intrinsic parameters, while the rating update rule involves the update of ratings of both users, and uses differential punishments that punish users with different ratings differently. By quantifying necessary and sufficient conditions for a sustainable social norm, we formulate the problem of designing an optimal two-sided rating protocol that maximizes the social welfare among all sustainable protocols, provide design guidelines for optimal two-sided rating protocols and a low-complexity algorithm to select optimal design parameters in an alternate manner. Finally, evaluation results show the validity and effectiveness of our protocol designed for service exchange dilemma in crowdsourcing.","1556-6021","","10.1109/TIFS.2018.2834318","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61402418,11531011,11771013,61503342,61672468,61602418); Social Development Project of Zhejiang Provincial Public Technology Research(grant numbers:2017C33054); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8355788","Service exchange;incentive mechanism;rating protocol;differential punishment;sustainable social norm;game theory","Crowdsourcing;Protocols;Servers;Games;Task analysis;Monitoring;Computer science","","30","","34","IEEE","7 May 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, we propose a Privacy-Preserving Task Matching (PPTM) with threshold similarity search via vehicular crowdsourcing. We first propose an interest-based PPTM by transforming vehicular workers' interests into binary vectors. By using Symmetric-key Threshold Predicate Encryption (STPE) and proxy re-encryption, PPTM achieves privacy-preserving multi-keyword task matching with Jaccard similarity search in multi-worker multi-requester setting. Furthermore, by comparing the Euclidean distances between workers and requesters against a pre-defined threshold, PPTM preserves the location privacy of workers and requesters that only reveals the comparison results to the crowdsourcing server. The security analysis and extensive experiments demonstrate that PPTM protects the confidentiality of locations and interests of requesters and workers while achieving the efficient task matching.","1939-9359","","10.1109/TVT.2021.3088869","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61772191,61902123,62002112); National Key R&D Program of China(grant numbers:2018YFB0704000); Science and Technology Key Projects of Hunan Province(grant numbers:2019WK2072,2018TP3001); China Scholarship Council; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9454299","Vehicular crowdsourcing;task matching;similarity search;privacy-preserving","Task analysis;Servers;Crowdsourcing;Privacy;Encryption;Security;Keyword search","","26","","36","IEEE","14 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, the crowdsourcing systems are established in virtual environments, the identities of the participants are various and complicated, the systems could scarcely identify malicious nodes automatically. So it is very hard to preserve the complete evidence of malicious behaviors and investigate relevant legal responsibilities. Blockchain is regarded as a very promising solution to these problems because it possesses characteristics of decentration, non-modifiability and traceability. However, a main challenge is to design an applicable blockchain consensus algorithm which can reach an agreement on credibility of participants automatically, prevent transaction data from tampering, and trace to the source of malicious behaviors. In this paper, an improved Proof-of-Trust (PoT) consensus scheme is proposed with the underlying technology of blockchain, which is properly to the crowdsourcing service scenarios. Firstly, this PoT consensus selects nodes with high credibility using subjective logic reputation algorithm. Only selected nodes have the chance to generate blocks, participate in verification, and claim crowdsourcing tasks. Secondly, the choice scheme of generate-block nodes is further optimized through the unpredictability of timestamp and digital signature. Moreover, an incentive mechanism based on game theory is designed in this consensus. With this mechanism, candidate nodes prefer to give honest verification results rather than engage in collusion with malicious nodes. The analysis and simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness, feasibility and scalability of the proposed approach.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2998803","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9104671","Blockchain;crowdsourcing;reputation model;incentive mechanism","Crowdsourcing;Blockchain;Consensus algorithm;Task analysis;Protocols;Telecommunications;Law","","21","","20","CCBY","1 Jun 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Companies are increasingly using crowdsourcing to accomplish specific software development tasks. However, this development model still faces many challenges. One of the key issues is the collaboration between crowdsourced workers. Developer collaboration is important to software development, but workers in crowdsourcing come from an undefined network community, so it's hard to guarantee that they can work together. This paper focuses on task assignment and uses the active time of workers as the basis of grouping to provide a solution for multi-task to multi-worker allocation. Based on the on-demand distribution model, this paper considers three factors: worker's ability, task module complexity, and worker's active time. First, the workers are divided into multiple collaborative candidate groups based on active time. Then, the Hungarian algorithm is used to select the optimal workers for each module from the collaborative candidate groups of each task, and the coordination candidate group replacement strategy is used to solve the assignment failure problem. Finally completing the assignment of all tasks within an assignment cycle. The experiments have shown that the proposed method increases the total utility by 25% and the success rate of distribution by 30% than the sequential assignment method.

This assumption may not be true in large-scale crowdsourcing scenarios. To address this issue, we diffuse the crowdsourcing tasks via the social network. We study two task diffusion models, and formulate the problem of minimizing the total cost such that all tasks can be completed in expectation for each model. The topology based influence estimation and history based influence estimation based on the limited knowledge of social network are presented in this paper. Further, we present the global influence estimation method to measure the influence over the whole community with the full knowledge of social network. We design two sealed reverse auction based truthful incentive mechanisms, MTD-L and MTD-IC, for both diffusion models. Through both rigorous theoretical analysis and extensive simulations, we demonstrate that the proposed mechanisms achieve computational efficiency, individual rationality, truthfulness, and guaranteed approximation.

Many truth discovery methods and incentive mechanisms for crowdsourcing have been proposed. However, most of them cannot deal with the crowdsourcing with copiers, who copy a part (or all) of data from other workers. This article aims at designing crowdsourcing incentive mechanism for truth discovery of textual answers with copiers. We formulate the problem of maximizing the social welfare such that all tasks can be completed with the least confidence for truth discovery and design an three-stage incentive mechanism. In contextual embedding and clustering stage, we construct and cluster the content vector representations of textual crowdsourced answers at the semantic level. In truth discovery stage, we estimate the truth for each task based on the dependence and accuracy of workers. In reverse auction stage, we design a greedy algorithm to select the winners and determine the payment. Through both rigorous theoretical analysis and extensive simulations, we demonstrate that the proposed mechanisms achieve computational efficiency, individual rationality, truthfulness, and guaranteed approximation. Moreover, our truth discovery methods show prominent advantage in terms of precision when there are copiers in the crowdsourcing systems.","1939-1374","","10.1109/TSC.2021.3075741","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61872193,61872191,62072254); NSF(grant numbers:1717315); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9416787","Crowdsourcing;truth discovery;incentive mechanism;Bayesian analysis;semantic analysis","Crowdsourcing;Task analysis;Semantics;Knowledge discovery;Data aggregation;Computational modeling;Tools","","19","","47","IEEE","27 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, few of these auctions consider the robustness against false-name attacks (a.k.a. sybil attacks), where dishonest users generate fake identities to increase their utilities without devoting more efforts. To provide countermeasures against such attacks, we have designed a Truthful Auction with countermeasures against False-name Attacks (TAFA) as an auction-based incentive mechanism for crowdsourcing. We prove that TAFA is truthful, individually rational, budget-balanced, and computationally efficient.

To mitigate the biased evaluation of malicious requesters, we propose a privacy-aware verification protocol leveraging the threshold Paillier cryptosystem, with which a certain number of workers can collaboratively verify the evaluation results without knowing any sensory data. Furthermore, we define the three roles of a user and elaborate a comprehensive reputation evaluation model enforced by smart contracts for its trustworthy running.

To increase the efficiency of task allocating and recruit suitable workers, the crowdsourcing server needs to obtain information related to task content and worker profiles, which poses a threat to privacy leaks of both tasks and workers. Although several privacy-preserving crowdsourcing mechanisms with simultaneously achieving task privacy and worker privacy have been proposed, there are two problems for these schemes, either the ability of workers is not taken into account or they are computationally intensive. To address the above problems simultaneously, fog-assisted privacy-preserving task allocation in crowdsourcing is proposed by means of the advantages of fog computing, which can not only achieve privacy protection of both the task and the worker but also alleviate the workers' computational burden by offloading partial computation to the fog node. By applying threshold secret sharing technology, the proposed scheme enables that only workers satisfying task requirements can decrypt the task content, which achieves the verification of the workers' ability and resists the attacks of the greedy workers. Then, rigorous security proofs about privacy properties are given in the proposed scheme. Finally, the proposed scheme is estimated through theoretical analysis and experiments. The experimental results show that compared with the current state-of-the-art scheme, the proposed scheme has more advantages in terms of computational cost and storage overhead. Especially for a worker, it only requires one pairing and two multiplication operations in the decrypting phase.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2020.2989578","Beijing Municipal Natural Science Foundation(grant numbers:4162020); Guangxi Key Laboratory of Cryptography and Information Security(grant numbers:GCIS201808,GCIS201710); Engineering Program Project of CUC(grant numbers:3132015XNG1541); Foundation of Guizhou Provincial Key Laboratory of Public Big Data(grant numbers:2019BDKFJJ012); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9076304","Ability verification;crowdsourcing;fog computing;privacy preserving;task allocation","Task analysis;Crowdsourcing;Privacy;Resource management;Cryptography;Servers","","17","","33","IEEE","22 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Therefore, task recommendation is necessary. However, existing work ignores the dynamics in crowdsourcing system, i.e., new tasks continually arrive, which leads to the issues of task cold-start. To overcome the challenge of the new coming task recommendation, this article proposes a feature-based Bayesian task recommendation (BTR) scheme. The key idea to deal with the dynamics of the crowdsourcing system lies in that the BTR learns the latent factor of the task through the task features instead of task ID and then learns the user's preference according to their historical behaviors. Specifically, based on task features and the user's historical behavior records, BTR can not only timely provide crowdworkers with personalized task recommendations but also solve the task cold-start problem. The simulations based on the real crowdsourced data set demonstrate that BTR performs better than other typical schemes that target at recommending the newly arrived tasks to crowdworkers.","2329-924X","","10.1109/TCSS.2020.2986836","Qinglan Project of Jiangsu Province; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9076653","Crowdsourcing system;neural network;task cold start;task recommendation","Task analysis;Crowdsourcing;Collaboration;Bayes methods;History;Recommender systems;Human intelligence","","16","","25","IEEE","23 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This technology promises to provide information on propagation environments and transceivers’ location, thus creating several new services and applications for the Internet of Things and environment-aware communication. Using crowdsourcing data collected by multiple agents appears to be much potential for enhancing SLAM performance. However, the measurement uncertainties in practice and biased estimations from multiple agents may result in serious errors. This study develops a robust SLAM method with measurement plug-and-play and crowdsourcing mechanisms to address the above problems. First, we divide measurements into different categories according to their unknown biases and realize a measurement plug-and-play mechanism by extending the classic belief propagation (BP)-based SLAM method. The proposed mechanism can obtain the time-varying agent location, radio features, and corresponding measurement biases (such as clock bias, orientation bias, and received signal strength model parameters), with high accuracy and robustness in challenging scenarios without any prior information on anchors and agents. Next, we establish a probabilistic crowdsourcing-based SLAM mechanism, in which multiple agents cooperate to construct and refine the radio map in a decentralized manner. Our study presents the first BP-based crowdsourcing that resolves the “double count” and “data reliability” problems through the flexible application of probabilistic data association methods. Numerical results reveal that the crowdsourcing mechanism can further improve the accuracy of the mapping result, which, in turn, ensures the decimeter-level localization accuracy of each agent in a challenging propagation environment.","1558-2248","","10.1109/TWC.2021.3104006","National Key Research and Development Program(grant numbers:2018YFA0701602); National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) for Distinguished Young Scholars(grant numbers:61625106); NSFC(grant numbers:61941104); Scientific Research Foundation of Graduate School of Southeast University(grant numbers:YBPY2015); Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan(grant numbers:MOST 110-2224-E-110-001); NSFC(grant numbers:61971126); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9516898","Belief propagation;crowdsourcing;measurement plug-and-play;multipath channel;simultaneous localization and mapping;wireless communication","Simultaneous localization and mapping;Crowdsourcing;Location awareness;Wireless communication;Mobile agents;Measurement uncertainty;Probabilistic logic","","16","","36","IEEE","18 Aug 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Quality-aware crowdsourcing is beneficial as it makes use of workers’ data quality to perform task allocation and data aggregation. However, a worker’s quality and data can be her private information that she may have incentive to misreport to the crowdsourcing requester. Moreover, a worker’s quality and data can depend on her sensitive information (e.g., location), which can be inferred from the outcomes of task allocation and data aggregation by an adversary. In this paper, we devise Privacy-preserving crowdsourcing mechanisms for truthful Data Quality Elicitation (PDQE). In these mechanisms, we design differentially private task allocation and data aggregation algorithms to prevent the inference of a worker’s quality and data from the outcomes of these algorithms. In the meantime, the mechanisms also incentivize workers to truthfully report their quality and data and make desired efforts. We first focus on the mechanisms for a single task (S-PDQE) and then extend it to the case of multiple tasks (M-PDQE). We further show that both the mechanisms achieve a bounded performance gap compared to the optimal strategy. We evaluate the proposed mechanisms using simulations based on real-world data, which corroborate their highly-desired properties on truthful data quality elicitation, data accuracy and privacy protection.","1558-0660","","10.1109/TMC.2020.3040138","startup fund and Intramural Grants Program(grant numbers:190599); Auburn University; National Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:U1711265,61972432); Program for Guangdong Introducing Innovative and Entrepreneurial Teams(grant numbers:2017ZT07X355); Pearl River Talent Recruitment Program(grant numbers:2017GC010465); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9268064","Data crowdsourcing;differentially privacy;incentive mechanism;data quality elicitation","Crowdsourcing;Task analysis;Data integrity;Data privacy;Resource management;Mobile computing;Inference algorithms","","16","","44","IEEE","24 Nov 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, we first introduce a taxonomy of task assignment in spatial crowdsourcing. Next, we design an approximation algorithm and get an efficient solution for the important problem, namely, Bounded and Heterogeneous Task Assignment (BHTA), such that the sum of the rewards of workers is maximized subject to multiple constraints. We prove that the BHTA problem is NP-hard. Subsequently, we propose a constant-ratio approximation algorithm based on partition and shifting method to achieve the assignment solution. To meet with the workers' dynamism, we further devise a greedy algorithm and provide theoretical guarantee. Experiments on synthetic and real datasets demonstrate the efficiency of our strategy over previous methods.

Typically, existing crowdsourcing platforms include CrowdFlower, Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT), and so on, in which workers can autonomously select tasks to do. However, due to the unreliability of workers or the difficulties of tasks, workers may sometimes finish doing tasks either with incorrect/incomplete answers or with significant time delays. Existing studies considered improving the task accuracy through voting or learning methods, they usually did not fully take into account reducing the latency of the task completion. This is especially critical, when a task requester posts a group of tasks (e.g., sentiment analysis), and one can only obtain answers of all tasks after the last task is accomplished. As a consequence, the time delay of even one task in this group could delay the next step of the task requester’s work from minutes to days, which is quite undesirable for the task requester. Inspired by the importance of the task accuracy and latency, in this paper, we will propose a novel crowdsourcing framework, namely Fast and Reliable crOwdsourcinG framework (FROG), which intelligently assigns tasks to workers, such that the latencies of tasks are reduced and the expected accuracies of tasks are met. Specifically, our FROG framework consists of two important components, task scheduler and notification modules. For the task scheduler module, we formalize a FROG task scheduling (FROG-TS) problem, in which the server actively assigns workers to tasks to achieve high task reliability and low task latency. We prove that the FROG-TS problem is NP-hard. Thus, we design two heuristic approaches, request-based and batch-based scheduling. For the notification module, we define an efficient worker notifying (EWN) problem, which only sends task invitations to those workers with high probabilities of accepting the tasks. To tackle the EWN problem, we propose a smooth kernel density estimation approach to estimate the probability that a worker accepts the task invitation. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed FROG platform on both real and synthetic data sets.","1558-2191","","10.1109/TKDE.2018.2849394","Hong Kong RGC(grant numbers:16207617); Science and Technology Planning Project of Guangdong Province, China(grant numbers:2015B010110006); NSFC(grant numbers:61729201,61232018); Microsoft Research Asia Collaborative Grant, and NSFC Guang Dong(grant numbers:U1301253,HKUST SSTSP FP305); Lian Start Up(grant numbers:220981); Kent State University; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8392362","Crowdsourcing framework;scheduling algorithm;greedy algorithm;EM algorithm","Greedy algorithms;Crowdsourcing;Scheduling algorithms;Expectation-maximization algorithms","","15","","46","IEEE","21 Jun 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This poses new challenges to the crowdsourcing field. One of the core research areas of spatio-temporal crowdsourcing is task assignment. Most of the existing research on task assignment is focused on offline optimal task assignment, where, the platform has already learned all the information about workers and tasks beforehand. However, these studies cannot obtain good results in real-world situations. At the same time, online task assignment problems often result in local optimal assignment. To solve these problems, more attention needs to be paid to online task assignments and the arrival time of workers. This paper proposes an Online Bilateral Assignment (OBA) problem based on the online assignment model. The competitive ratio of the Greedy algorithm is analyzed according to the OBA problem model. Also, another solution to the OBA problem according to the Greedy algorithm, the Improved-Baseline algorithm, is proposed. Additionally, a Bilateral Online Priority Reassignment algorithm (BOPR) is proposed. The BOPR algorithm realizes real-time task/worker assignment through the bilateral assignment as a solution for online task assignment. In order to guarantee the number of matching tasks, a priority queue is designed in the BOPR algorithm. Considering the waiting time deadlines of tasks and workers and the error rate for priority ranking, it avoids tasks and workers waiting too long and assigns each task to the best possible extent. On this basis, a two-stage assignment strategy is designed for unsuccessful tasks, which could minimize the error rate of the task and significantly improve the efficiency of task assignment. Finally, through experiments on real data sets, the algorithm's performance in terms of global utility value and the number of matches is evaluated.","1939-1374","","10.1109/TSC.2022.3197676","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62073201,62072392,62172351); Youth Innovation Science and Technology Support Program of Shandong Provincial(grant numbers:2021KJ080); Shandong Natural Science Foundation(grant numbers:ZR2020KF019); Major scientific and technological innovation projects of Shandong Province(grant numbers:2019JZZY020131); Yantai Science and Technology Innovation Development Plan(grant numbers:2021YT06000645); Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications(grant numbers:SKLNST-2022-1-12); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9854201","Spatio-temporal crowdsourcing;online bilateral assignment;priority queue;bilateral online reassignment;two-stage task assignment","Task analysis;Crowdsourcing;Optimization;Technological innovation;Heuristic algorithms;Data models;Computer science","","14","","50","IEEE","10 Aug 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, the rapid growth of user scale and massive data collected inevitably brings serious challenges to computing and storage resources. The emergence of cloud computing provides an opportunity to handle such challenges. Its nearly unlimited resource provision capability can provide reliable services for different crowdsourcing applications. Nevertheless, considering the risks of privacy leakage and vendor lock-in using only a single cloud, as well as the additional restrictions caused by the wide geographical distribution of data and associations among workers, the use of multi-cloud seems to be a better choice. In this article, we define a problem to find an effective data placement scheme for spatial crowdsourcing in multi-cloud environment to achieve the cost-effectiveness and minimal latency. We take full account of the interval pricing strategy. Then we analyze the geographical distribution characteristics of data centers through a clustering algorithm, and propose an effective data initialization strategy. Finally, we use a genetic algorithm to further optimize the results. Through experiments on real-world data from cloud providers, the efficiency and effectiveness of our proposed method is verified. Compared with some existing algorithms, the proposed method can significantly reduce the system cost and latency, among which the cost reduction is up to 150 times and the latency reduction is up to twice.","2168-7161","","10.1109/TCC.2021.3119862","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61602109); DHU Distinguished Young Professor Program(grant numbers:LZB2019003); Shanghai Science and Technology Innovation Action Plan(grant numbers:19511101802); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; Deanship of Scientific Research; King Abdulaziz University(grant numbers:RG-60-135-42); Omantel-SQU(grant numbers:EG/SQU-OT/19/04); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9573442","Spatial crowdsourcing;multi-cloud;data placement;interval pricing;density clustering","Crowdsourcing;Cloud computing;Data centers;Costs;Task analysis;Reliability;Memory","","14","","49","IEEE","14 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, to efficiently handle the crowdsourcing recruitment problem, we propose to recruit participants with the duration-variable principle and prove that it performs better compared to the strategy that recruits vehicles for all required time periods. The duration-variable principle enables recruitment of vehicular sensing resources across different time epochs to maximize the crowdsourcing profits. To ensure the utilization of limited budget, we formulate the duration-variable participant recruitment (DPR) problem with the consideration of indeterministic trajectories to determine which vehicle subset is chosen and how many epochs are provided for each selected vehicle. Since the formulated problem is NP-hard, we propose a two-step DPR algorithm by maximizing the available sensing resource utilization efficiency in each recruitment round, which is shown to be near-optimal and has low computational complexity. Experiments on real traces show that the proposed DPR scheme exceeds three other solutions in providing higher spatial coverage for urban crowdsourcing applications.","1939-9359","","10.1109/TVT.2017.2718043","State Key Laboratory of Rail Traffic Control and Safety(grant numbers:RCS2016ZT012,RCS2017ZT009); National Nature Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61401016); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(grant numbers:2017M610040); Fundamental Research Funds; Central Universities(grant numbers:2016RC056); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7954643","Crowdsourcing;duration-variable participant recruitment;indeterministic trajectories;limited budget","Recruitment;Crowdsourcing;Sensors;Trajectory;Roads;Algorithm design and analysis;Computational complexity","","13","","33","IEEE","21 Jun 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, most existing studies have concentrated on designing offline two-sided auction mechanisms and supporting single-type tasks and fixed auction service models. Such works ignore the need of dynamic services and are unsuitable for large-scale crowdsourcing markets with extremely diverse demands (i.e., types and urgency degrees of tasks required by different requesters) and supplies (i.e., task skills and online durations of different workers). In this article, we consider a practical crowdsourcing application with an on-demand service strategy. Especially, we innovatively design three online service models, namely, online single-bid single-task (OSS), online single-bid multiple-task (OSM), and online multiple-bid multiple-task (OMM) models to accommodate diversified tasks and bidding demands for different users. Furthermore, to effectively allocate tasks and facilitate bidding, we propose a truthful online double auction mechanism for each service model based on the McAfee double auction. By doing so, each user can flexibly select auction service models and corresponding auction mechanisms according to their current interested tasks and online duration. To illustrate this, we present a three-demand example to explain the effectiveness of our on-demand service strategy in realistic crowdsourcing applications. Moreover, we theoretically prove that our mechanisms satisfy truthfulness, individual rationality, budget balance, and consumer sovereignty. Through extensive simulations, we show that our mechanisms can accommodate the various demands of different users and improve social utility, including platform utility and average user utility.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2022.3151924","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62171113,61941113); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:N2116011,N2116003); U.K. EPSRC(grant numbers:EP/K011693/1); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9714505","Mobile crowdsourcing;on-demand service;online double auction;truthful mechanism design","Task analysis;Crowdsourcing;Biological system modeling;Internet of Things;Resource management;Nickel;Data models","","13","","30","IEEE","16 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Recently, with the explosive growth of online social network, Word of Mouth (WoM)-based crowdsourcing systems have emerged, in which besides conducting the tasks by themselves, participants simultaneously recruit other individuals through exploiting their social networks to help solve crowdsourced tasks. This crowdsourcing paradigm can greatly facilitate to grow the pool of crowdworkers. However, there exist two conflicting challenges in designing an effective WoM-based incentive mechanism: 1) sybil attack and 2) heterogeneous effect of participants. That is, intuitively, incentivizing (usually compensating for) common-ability individuals will inevitably stimulate the behavior of sybil attack (i.e., some individuals create multiple sybils, and split the total efforts into those sybils to expect more compensation). This paper proposes a novel biased contest-based crowdsourcing incentive mechanism through exploiting social networks (BciNet), aiming to balance those two conflicting objectives. BciNet is composed of two phases. First, based on spreading activation model, an enhanced geometric virtual point dissemination mechanism is able to provide sybil-proof property and accommodate the realistic social network structure. Second, based on participants' virtual points, a biased contest gives more reward to less able participants. Through carefully calibrating the bias factor, simulation results based on the real dataset show that BciNet can greatly improve the amount of participants' effort levels, and actually be robust against the sybil attack. In brief, for a practical incentive mechanism, the methodology to address conflicting goals is to put rational individuals into dilemma: to be sybil or not to be, it is the problem, i.e., the potential gain from the sybils in the second phase may be offset by the loss in the first phase.","2168-2232","","10.1109/TSMC.2018.2837165","NSFC(grant numbers:61171092); Jiangsu Educational Bureau Project(grant numbers:14KJA510004); NUPTSFs(grant numbers:NY215177,NY217089); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8370841","Biased contest;incentive mechanism;social network;sybil attack;word of mouth (WoM)","Social network services;Task analysis;Crowdsourcing;Mouth;Robustness;Cybernetics;Aggregates","","11","","22","IEEE","1 Jun 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, we propose an intelligent multi attributes crowdsourcing task assignment with stability and satisfactory, called TASS. TASS can exploit the multi attributes to solve the stability of the transaction, and adopt the game theory to maximize the satisfaction of both sides during the task assignment.

In this paper, we propose a misreport- and collusion-proof crowdsourcing mechanism, guiding workers to truthfully report the quality of submitted tasks without collusion by designing a mechanism, so that workers have to act the way the requestor would like. In detail, the mechanism proposed by the requester makes no room for the workers to obtain profit through quality misreport and collusion, and thus, the quality can be controlled without any verification. Extensive simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed mechanism. Finally, the importance and originality of our work lie in that it reveals some interesting and even counterintuitive findings: 1) a high-quality worker may pretend to be a low-quality one; 2) the rise of task quality from high-quality workers may not result in the increased utility of the requestor; 3) the utility of the requestor may not get improved with the increasing number of workers.

Task assignment is fundamentally a many-to-one matching problem, where one task is allocated to multiple users who can meet the minimum quality requirement of the task within the limited budget. While most existing works try to maximize the utility of the crowdsourcing platform, we take into account the individual preferences of crowdsourcers and workers toward each other to ensure the stability of task assignment results.

In this paper, we conduct a large and comprehensive study of the structure of a number of crowdsourcing communities (CCs). We study various properties of association (ASSO) and interaction (INTR) networks in an attempt to compare them with existing networks, such as online social networks (OSNs) and the World Wide Web (WWW) network. We obtained data for five successful CCs with nearly two million vertices and nearly six million edges, as well as data for four popular social network sites, Flickr, YouTube, Orkut, and LiveJournal, with more than 11 million vertices and over 328 million edges. We also obtained WWW data containing over 18 million vertices and over 64 million edges. We believe this is the first structural comparative study of CC networks with social and WWW networks at this scale. Our study reveals that CC networks-both ASSO and INTR- are smaller and less symmetrical than OSNs. Similar to OSNs and WWW, degree distributions of CC networks follow powerlaw distribution. CCs and WWW do not suffer influence dilution as is the case in OSNs. Different than OSNs, members of CC networks tend to connect to others with varying degrees, as is the case with WWW.","2329-924X","","10.1109/TCSS.2017.2768325","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8122024","Analysis;crowdsourcing community (CC);measurement;social network;structure;topology","Crowdsourcing;Social network services;World Wide Web;Organizations;Network topology;Topology","","9","","66","IEEE","28 Nov 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The system throughput (number of assigned tasks) and workers' travel distance are two of many important factors in spatial crowdsourcing, and the improvement to one of them usually means the sacrifice of the other. However, most existing works resolve the trade-off between these two factors by simply targeting tasks within a bounding circle of each worker. In this paper, we compromise between the throughput and the distance by formulating these two factors as score terms in the objective function. This flexible formulation has the advantages of abandoning distant tasks and minimizing workers' travel distance for reachable tasks. Aside from that, we study the multi-campaign scenario of spatial crowdsourcing, which is not uncommon in practical applications while not yet discussed in existing works. The worker diversity of the campaigns is considered to be another goal and formulated as another score term in the objective function. Subsequently, the problem of multi-campaign oriented spatial crowdsourcing is to maximize the objective function comprised by the aforementioned score terms. We prove that the problem is NP-hard, thus, we propose several approximation solutions.

Requesters' tasks and workers' interests exposed to the remote crowdsourcing platform in the form of plaintext have raised serious privacy concerns. Encrypting tasks and interests is a feasible solution to protect the privacy of both the requesters and the workers. However, data encryption renders the existing crowdsourcing task recommendation techniques ineffective. To address this challenge, in this study, we transform the personalized task recommendation problem into a task access control and keyword-based search problem for encrypted tasks. On the basis of this idea, we first develop a new technique called multi-authority attribute-based searchable encryption by equipping the searchable capacity for Lewko and Waters's multi-authority attribute -based encryption.

However, existing studies have two typical drawbacks: 1) each team is created for only one task, which may be costly and cannot accommodate crowdsourcing markets with a large number of tasks; and 2) most existing studies form teams in a centralized manner by the requesters, which may place a heavy burden on requesters. In fact, we observe that many complex tasks at real-world crowdsourcing platforms have similar skill requirements and workers are often connected through social networks. Therefore, this paper explores distributed team formation-based batch crowdsourcing for complex tasks to address the drawbacks in existing studies, in which similar tasks can be addressed in a batch to reduce computational costs and workers can self-organize through their social networks to form teams. To solve such an NP-hard problem, this paper presents two approaches: one is to form a fixed team for all tasks in the batch; the other is to form a basic team that can be dynamically adjusted for each task in the batch. In comparison, the former approach has lower computational complexity but the latter approach performs better in reducing the total payments by requesters. With the experiments on a real-world dataset comparing with previous benchmark approaches, it is shown that the presented approaches have better performance in saving the costs of forming teams, payments by requesters, and communication among team members; moreover, the presented approaches have higher success rate of tasks and much better scalability.","1558-2183","","10.1109/TPDS.2022.3161019","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2019YFB1405000); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62076060,61932007,92046026,71871109); Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province(grant numbers:BK20201394); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9739859","Batch crowdsourcing;complex tasks;team formation;social network;distributed manner","Task analysis;Crowdsourcing;Social networking (online);Costs;Training;NP-hard problem;Reliability","","8","","41","IEEE","22 Mar 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

How to conduct quality control in such an application to achieve accurate classification results from noisy workers is an important and challenging task, and has drawn broad research interests. However, most existing works do not exploit the label acquisition phase, which results in their disability of making a proper budget allocation. Moreover, some works impractically make the assumption of managing workers, which is not supported by common crowdsourcing platforms such as AMT or CrowdFlower. To overcome these drawbacks, in this paper, we devise a Dynamic Label Acquisition and Answer Aggregation (DLTA) framework for crowdsourcing classification tasks. The framework proceeds in a sequence of rounds, adaptively conducting label inference and label acquisition. In each round, it analyzes the collected answers of previous rounds to perform proper budget allocation, and then issues the resultant query to the crowd. To support DLTA, we propose a generative model for the collection of labels, and correspondingly strategies for label inference and budget allocation. Experimental results show that compared with existing methods, DLTA obtains competitive accuracy in the binary case. Besides, its extended version, which plugs in the state-of-the-art inference technique, achieves the highest accuracy.","1558-2191","","10.1109/TKDE.2018.2849385","Hong Kong RGC GRF(grant numbers:16214716); National Grand Fundamental Research 973 Program of China(grant numbers:2014CB340303); National Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61729201); Science and Technology Planning Project of Guangdong Province, China(grant numbers:2015B010110006); Microsoft Research Asia Collaborative Research; Hong Kong University of Science and Technology(grant numbers:Group_USC 05); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8391732","Classification crowdsourcing;quality control;label inference;label acquisition","Task analysis;Crowdsourcing;Resource management;Reliability;Quality control;Labeling;Adaptation models","","7","","37","IEEE","21 Jun 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In 3D spatial crowdsourcing applications, a core issue is to develop an efficient global tasklist plan, based on the tripartite matching among the three parties, i.e., task requestors, workers and workplaces, which is different from the conventional spatial crowdsourcing. In this context, one key challenge is how to suitably schedule the available workers with the consideration of the interests of all the parties, under the constraint of worker resource. To answer the questions, in this paper, we propose and study a new problem, namely Social-Welfare-driven Task Scheduling (SWTS) problem, which strives to schedule the workers’ continuous routines, i.e., successively implementing tasks for different requestors at different workplaces, to promote the social welfare for all the involved parties. We prove our studied problem is NP-hard, and devise two heuristic optimization algorithms to solve it. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments which verify the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed algorithms on both real and synthetic data sets.","1558-0660","","10.1109/TMC.2022.3175305","National Natural Science Foundation for Distinguished Young Scholars(grant numbers:61725205,62025205); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:U2001207,61972319); Science and Technology Development Fund(grant numbers:SKL-IOTSC-2021-2023,0038/2021/AGJ); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9777857","Route plan;social welfare;spatial crowdsourcing;task scheduling;tripartite matching","Task analysis;Employment;Crowdsourcing;Three-dimensional displays;Sports;Schedules;Resource management","","6","","47","IEEE","18 May 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The mobile operator already has access to information on user demographics, location and presence, and monthly spending patterns. In addition, the MoneyBee platform gathers user information (such as preferences, skills, and reliability) from a user's interaction with the crowdsourcing service. Using this data to intelligently assign crowd-sourcing tasks to relevant workers is a challenging problem. Similarly, efficient dispatching of tasks to minimize the network load on the operator network is equally important. Further, simple interfaces (including speech) are needed to submit as well as execute crowdsourcing tasks on the mobile device. We describe initial solutions to some of these challenges in this paper.","1538-7305","","10.1002/bltj.20473","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6772558","","","","6","1","","","29 Apr 2014","","","Nokia Bell Labs","Nokia Bell Labs Journal"

Compared to carpooling approaches where the driver and participant passengers or riders are usually prearranged and the journey details known beforehand, the paradigm for ridesharing requires the participants to be selected at short notice and the rider trips are often dynamically formed. Crowdsourcing techniques and approaches are well suited to match drivers and riders for these dynamic scenarios, although there are many challenges to be addressed. This paper aims to survey this new paradigm of ridesharing and crowdsourcing for smart city transportation environments from several technological and social perspectives including: 1) ridesharing and architecture in transportation; 2) techniques for ridesharing; 3) artificial intelligence for ridesharing; 4) autonomous vehicles and systems ridesharing; and 5) security, policy and pricing strategies.

Tasks in crowdsourcing systems with specialized work have multiple steps and each step requires multiple skills. Steps may have different flexibilities in terms of obtaining service from one or multiple agents due to varying levels of dependency among parts of steps. Steps of a task may have precedence constraints among them. Moreover, there are variations in loads of different types of tasks requiring different skill sets and availabilities of agents with different skill sets. Considering these constraints together necessitate the design of novel schemes to allocate steps to agents. In addition, large crowdsourcing systems require allocation schemes that are simple, fast, decentralized, and offer customers (task requesters) the freedom to choose agents. In this paper, we study the performance limits of such crowdsourcing systems and propose efficient allocation schemes that provably meet the performance limits under these additional requirements. We demonstrate our algorithms on data from a crowdsourcing platform run by a nonprofit company and show significant improvements over current practice.","1558-2566","","10.1109/TNET.2018.2811736","National Science Foundation(grant numbers:CCF-1623821); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8320958","Crowdsourcing;human resource management;scheduling algorithms","Task analysis;Crowdsourcing;Resource management;Companies;IEEE transactions;Computer science;Numerical models","","6","","26","IEEE","21 Mar 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Moreover, we determined how they add value to attending companies and participants. In this regard, six qualitative and quantitative datasets from participants, companies, and the organizer were collected and analyzed. Our findings revealed five distinct crowdsourcing properties and mechanisms of mega hackathons, including intricate crowd selection, strong crowd vibe, instant crowd feedback, versatile crowd potential, and pervasive information technology.

Any ordinary Internet users with excessive resources can be recruited into such systems as mini-servers. Different from edge servers equipped with dedicated resources in traditional CDNs, the resource of a single mini-server is scarce and volatile that can vary severely with time, since its bandwidth is shared by many different applications. How to build a robust high performance crowdsourcing-based CDN system has attracted contributions from both academia and industry, but how to solve the drawback caused by unstable uploading bandwidth is still a challenging problem. So far, a prevalent methodology is to migrate the strategies implemented by traditional CDNs into crowdsourcing-based CDN systems based on the fact that these two kinds of systems share many similarities. In this paper, our argument is that the content delivery time can be reduced by replicating coded content on mini-servers (which is almost useless for edge servers in traditional CDNs) to enable downloading users to automatically adapt their downloading progress with oscillating bandwidth capacity from different mini-servers. Theoretical model is created to derive the performance improvement (evaluated in term of average file downloading time) achieved by our strategy, which is further validated via simulation. This paper not only provides system designers a more efficient content replication solution, but also can push forward the development of the crowdsourcing-based CDNs.","1558-2205","","10.1109/TCSVT.2017.2749253","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2016YFB0201900); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61572538); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:17LGJC23); Australian Research Council(grant numbers:DP150103658); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8026166","Crowdsourcing-based CDN;mini-servers;coded content;replication","Servers;Bandwidth;Internet;Streaming media;Network coding;Peer-to-peer computing","","5","","31","IEEE","6 Sep 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Task assignment is an important branch of crowdsourcing. Most existing studies in crowdsourcing have not considered self-interested individuals' strategy. To guarantee truthfulness, auction has been regarded as a promising method to charge the requesters for the tasks completed and reward the workers for performing the tasks. In this study, an online task assignment scenario is considered where each worker has a set of experienced skills, whereas a specific task is budget-constrained and requires one or more skills. In this scenario, the crowdsourcing task assignment was modeled as a reverse auction where the requesters are buyers and the workers are sellers. Three incentive mechanisms, namely, Truthful Mechanism for Crawdsourcing-Vickrey-Clarke-Grove (TMC-VCG), TMC-Simple Task (ST) for a simple task case, and TMC-Complex Task (CT) for a complex task case are proposed. Here, a simple task case means that the requester asks for a single skill, and a complex task case means that the requester asks for multiple skills. The related properties of each of the three mechanisms are determined theoretically. Moreover, the truthfulness is verified, and other performances are evaluated by extensive simulations.","1007-0214","","10.26599/TST.2018.9010064","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8484930","crowdsourcing;task assignment;auction;truthfulness","Task analysis;Crowdsourcing;Problem-solving;Heuristic algorithms;Reliability;Postal services;Software","","4","","","","14 Oct 2018","","","TUP","TUP Journals"
