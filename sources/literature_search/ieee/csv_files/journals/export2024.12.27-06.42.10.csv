Such frameworks typically employ a centralized infrastructure to implement required mechanisms such as task allocation, submission evaluation, and payment computation. However, centralized deployment comes with unresolved challenges in terms of trust, reliability, and transparency. Blockchain technology has been embraced for the deployment of crowdsourcing frameworks to enable trusted and autonomous execution. Each of the existing Blockchain-based crowdsourcing/ crowdsensing framework targets a specific application context due to the constraint capabilities of Blockchain. In this paper, we propose a context-aware Blockchain-based crowdsourcing framework where the context is defined by task requirements and workers’ availability. The proposed framework is developed upon the review of existing works integrating Blockchain and crowdsourcing where the challenges and future directions are identified. The proposed framework has two classes of components: 1) core components implementing the basic framework functionalities, and 2) advanced components which are context and data managers that help improve the framework performance. The Advanced Context Manager is designed to monitor the current context and select the mechanisms to run for the core components accordingly. The core components are implemented as smart contracts on Blockchain for autonomous and trusted execution, while the advanced components are implemented spanning Blockchain and the cloud for flexibility and scalability. A case study demonstrating the performance of context-aware task allocation algorithms is presented. It shows how capturing the current system context can help achieve better overall performance based on the objective of the sensing application under consideration.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3203850","Khalifa University of Science and Technology-Competitive Internal Research Award(grant numbers:CIRA-2020-028); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9874795","Crowdsourcing;blockchain;smart contracts;task allocation;context","Resource management;Crowdsourcing;Blockchains;Sensors;Smart contracts;Optimization;Context awareness","","4","","57","CCBY","1 Sep 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Due to the openness of mobile crowdsourcing, workers may yield low-quality task answers. To alleviate this problem, substantial efforts have been devoted to elicit truthful data from workers. On the other hand, to facilitate task assignment, workers are required to upload the platform their profiles, such as locations and expertise. Therefore, task assignment outcomes and thus mobile crowdsourcing service accuracy is subject to the quality of workers’ self-reported profiles. In this paper, we leverage incentive design to motivate workers to honestly reveal both task answers and their profiles. The challenge is to design one incentive payment for truth elicitation in two kinds of submissions. For this, we first derive the sufficient and necessary conditions for answer truthfulness and profile truthfulness separately. We then construct an incentive optimization problem that incorporates these conditions as constraints. Its optimal solution lists the payment to each worker that elicits answers and profiles jointly. Our proposed mechanism, with a formally proved bounded approximation ratio, ensures that truth-telling is a Bayesian Nash equilibrium. We prototype the mechanism and conduct a series of experiments that involve 30 volunteers to validate the efficacy and efficiency of the proposed mechanism.","1558-0660","","10.1109/TMC.2022.3159228","National Science Foundation(grant numbers:CNS-1943509,OIA-1937143); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9735304","Mobile crowdsourcing;joint answer and profile truthfulness;incentive mechanism design","Task analysis;Crowdsourcing;Costs;Sensors;Mobile handsets;Mobile computing;Bayes methods","","4","","44","IEEE","15 Mar 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In vehicular networks, a spatial-temporal task/question can be outsourced (i.e., task/question relating to a particular location and in a specific time period) to some suitable smart vehicles (also known as workers) and then these workers can help solve the task/question. However, an inevitable barrier to the widespread deployment of spatial crowdsourcing applications in vehicular networks is the concern of privacy. Hence, We propose a novel privacy-friendly spatial crowdsourcing scheme. Unlike the existing schemes, the proposed scheme considers the privacy issue from a new perspective according that the spatial-temporal tasks can be linked and analyzed to break the location privacy of workers. Specifically, to address the challenge, three privacy requirements (i.e. anonymity, untraceability, and unlinkability) are defined and the proposed scheme combines an efficient anonymous technique with a new composite privacy metric to protect against attackers. Detailed privacy analyses show that the proposed scheme is privacy-friendly. In addition, performance evaluations via extensive simulations are also conducted, and the results demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed scheme.","2509-3312","","10.1007/s41650-017-0017-7","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8932230","spatial crowdsourcing;vehicular networks;location privacy;IoV (Internet of Vehicles);privacy metric","Task analysis;Crowdsourcing;Privacy;Sensors;Measurement;Trajectory;Servers","","4","","","","6 Feb 2020","","","PTP","PTP Journals"

However, the labels collected by crowdsourcing are usually unreliable and noisy. This issue is mainly caused by: 1) nonflexible data collection mechanisms; 2) nonincentive payment functions; and 3) inexpert crowd workers. We propose a new robust crowdsourcing framework as a comprehensive solution for all these challenging problems. Our unified framework consists of three novel components. First, we introduce a new flexible data collection mechanism based on the cumulative voting system, allowing crowd workers to express their confidence for each option in multi-choice questions. Second, we design a novel payment function regarding the settings of our data collection mechanism. The payment function is theoretically proved to be incentive-compatible, encouraging crowd workers to disclose truthfully their beliefs to get the maximum payment. Third, we propose efficient aggregation models, which are compatible with both single-option and multi-option crowd labels. We define a new aggregation model, called simplex constrained majority voting (SCMV), and enhance it by using the probabilistic generative model. Furthermore, fast optimization algorithms are derived for the proposed aggregation models. Experimental results indicate higher quality for the crowd labels collected by our proposed mechanism without increasing the cost. Our aggregation models also outperform the state-of-the-art models on multiple crowdsourcing data sets in terms of accuracy and convergence speed.","2162-2388","","10.1109/TNNLS.2019.2956523","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61572388,61703327); Key R&D Program-The Key Industry Innovation Chain of Shaanxi(grant numbers:2017ZDCXL-GY-05-04-02,2017ZDCXL-GY-05-02,2018ZDXM-GY-176); National Key R&D Program of China(grant numbers:2017YFE0104100); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8959391","Crowdsourcing aggregation model;data collection mechanism;incentive payment function","Data collection;Crowdsourcing;Data models;Task analysis;Noise measurement;Probabilistic logic;Optimization","","3","","45","IEEE","14 Jan 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, engineers are busy resources and time is a valuable asset in industry, which hinders internal crowdsourcing in software engineering from becoming a widespread practice. In this work, we propose a low-cost variant of internal crowdsourcing for locating features in models, which limits the time that engineers can spend for providing knowledge. Our approach uses the knowledge provided by the internal crowd to automatically reformulate an initial feature description. The result is taken as input to automatically locate the relevant model fragment using Latent Semantic Indexing. We evaluate our approach using four query reformulation techniques in a real-world case study from our industrial partner. We compare the results of our approach in terms of recall, precision and F-measure with a baseline by means of statistical methods to show that the impact of the results of our approach is significant. Despite the limitation of time, the results show that low-cost in internal crowdsourcing improves significantly the results in an industrial context where engineers' availability is scarce.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2985915","Ministerio de Economa y Competitividad(grant numbers:RTI2018-096411-B-I00); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9057505","Crowdsourced software engineering;crowdsourcing;collaborative information retrieval;query reformulation;feature location","Crowdsourcing;Software engineering;Software;Task analysis;Feature extraction;Large scale integration;Knowledge engineering","","3","","45","CCBY","6 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, recent trajectory synthesizing techniques are still threatened by the information that the attacker inevitably obtains, such as the locations of the accepted tasks in the crowdsourcing application. With this information and the spatiotemporal correlation hidden in the user's mobility, the attacker can infer the user's actual location and even future behaviors. It remains open to defend against such inferential attacks in the continual crowdsourcing scenarios. In this paper, we propose a mobility-aware differentially private solution, ConCrowdDP, for achieving the privacy-preserving continual crowdsourcing application. Specifically, before starting the application, we first construct a spatiotemporal mobile model, STMarkov, to model the spatiotemporal correlation in users' mobility. Then, a perturbed location is generated for the user to participate in the crowdsourcing application, according to STMarkov and K-norm DP. Finally, we eliminate the privacy threat brought by the accepted task based on K-norm DP and Bayesian posterior theorem. With ConCrowd-DP in place, a mobility-aware differentially private trace is generated for the user to participate in the application continually. Extensive experiments with real-world datasets demonstrate that ConCrowd-DP guarantees the usability of the synthesized trajectory effectively, while providing the DP protection for defending against the inferential attacks which stem from the multiple accepted tasks.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3058211","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2018YFE0207600); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:U1736216,61571352,61602364); Project of Hainan Province Key Research and Development Program(grant numbers:ZDYF2019202); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9350628","Location privacy preservation;trajectory prediction;inferential attacks;differential privacy;continual location sharing","Task analysis;Crowdsourcing;Privacy;Spatiotemporal phenomena;Trajectory;Sensitivity;Correlation","","2","","38","CCBYNCND","9 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Considering the high uncertainty of answers for subjective tasks, in this paper, we propose a background knowledge enhanced quality estimation method.

Then, we construct a pseudo-gold answer set for each task. Next, by comparing the provided answer with the derived pseudo-gold answer set, we calculate two different scores for each answer: 1) symbolic score, which measures the symbolic similarity and 2) embedding score, which indicates the embedding similarity. Finally, we get the final scores for each answer by combining these two scores.

In this article, we focus on the crowdsourcing of small tasks such as image labeling and voice recording, where we face a number of challenges. First, workers have different limits on the amount of work they would be willing to do, and they may also misreport these limits in their bid for the work. Second, if the auction is repeated over time, unsuccessful workers may dropout of the system, reducing competition and diversity. To tackle these issues, we first extend the results of the celebrated Myerson’s optimal auction mechanism for a single-parameter bid to the case where the bid consists of the unit cost of work, the maximum amount of work one is willing to do, and the actual work completed. We show that a simple payment mechanism is sufficient to ensure a dominant strategy from the workers, and that this dominant strategy is robust to the true utility function of the workers. Second, we propose a novel, flexible work allocation mechanism, which allows the requester to balance between cost efficiency and equality. While cost minimization is obviously important, encouraging equality in the allocation of work increases the diversity of the workforce as well as promotes a long-term participation on the crowdsourcing platform. Our main results are proved analytically and validated through simulations.","2329-924X","","10.1109/TCSS.2022.3149000","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9721532","Auction;crowdsourcing;mechanism design;return on investment (ROI)","Crowdsourcing;Costs;Resource management;Task analysis;Games;Sensors;Crowdsensing","","1","","42","IEEE","25 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Using an NLP-crowdsourcing convergence strategy, we can reduce the costs of microtask crowdsourcing while saving time and maintaining disambiguation accuracy over large datasets. This article contributes a next-gen crowd-artificial intelligence framework that used an ensemble of term frequency-inverse document frequency and bidirectional encoder representation from transformers to obtain similarity rankings for pairs of scientific documents. A sequence of content-based similarity tasks was created using a crowd-powered interface for solving disambiguation problems.

A possible reason for this is that we currently lack a systematic approach that would aid software managers during the process of designing software development tasks that will be crowdsourced. This paper attempts to extend the current knowledge on designing crowdsourced software development tasks, by empirically answering the following management questions: (a) what type of projects should be crowdsourced; (b) why should one crowdsource-in terms of acquired benefits; (c) where should one crowdsource-in terms of application domain; (d) when to crowdsource-referring to the time period of the year; (e) who will win or participate in the contest; and (f) how to crowdsource (define contest duration, prize, type of contest etc.) to acquire the maximum benefits-depending on the goal of crowdsourcing. To answer the aforementioned questions, we have performed a case study on 2,209 software development tasks crowdsourced through TopCoder platform. The results suggest that there are significant differences in the level to which crowdsourcing goals are reached, across different software development activities.

WSs are provided to client application developers through web Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), such as YouTube API, Twitter API, Facebook API, etc. Due to the popularity of WSs, the developers frequently discuss various WSs-based application’ issues on online forums, such as Stack Overflow (SO). This study aims to highlight the problems faced by client developers in the development process of WSs-based applications using the dataset of SO. The comprehension of developers’ conversations on SO can give insight into the frequency, difficulty, and popularity of different WSs-related problems of developers. We downloaded 12,746 posts from SO relevant to WSs-related issues for this article. We used the topic modeling technique (LDA) to extract various topics from the SO dataset. The topics are labeled and organized into categories and sub-categories according to relationships among them. The difficulty and popularity of each topic have been analyzed. Our investigation yield several findings. First, developers focus on six topics related to WSs on SO: Client APIs development, Data Processing, Web services Authorization, Framework Support, Web APIs, and Mobile Applications. Secondly, the advantages and disadvantages of web applications topic (Fused_Popularity=0.39), from the Clients APIs development category have the highest prevalence, followed by Database (DB) and Data Processing in Applications topic (Fused_Popularity=0.38) from the Data Processing category. Third, most WSs-related topics in all categories are evolving promptly on SO, i.e., new questions are added daily about WSs development, deployment, and authorization. Fourth, the questions of type “how” are primarily asked in Framework support, Client APIs development, and Web APIs categories. Although, many questions in other categories are of the kind “What”. It is also observed that WSs developers not only used SO to ask How and What types of questions but they also used SO to ask information-seeking questions (i.e., in Data processing and Client APIs development categories). Fifth, the topics relevant to Web APIs (Fused_Popularity=10.8) and Client API Development ((Fused_Popularity=9.35) categories of WSs are very popular on SO. Sixth, the questions relevant to the Web APIs (Fused_Difficulty =3) & Client APIs development (Fused_Difficulty=2.25) categories are more difficult than the other four categories. The results of our research may be helpful for the following WSs stakeholders: WSs Client application developers, WSs Educators, and WSs researchers. The WSs Educators and investigators can get more knowledge of new methods and discover novel techniques to make challenging WSs topics easy to understand. WSs framework developers can utilize our extracted WSs topics and categories to know the preferences of WSs developers that may support them in upgrading existing frameworks or developing new ones.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3238813","Higher Education Commission (HEC), Pakistan, through the Faculty Development Program (FDP); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10024284","Client applications;web services;web APIs;client application problems","Documentation;Web services;Mobile applications;Software engineering;Data processing;Software development management;Computer science","","5","","133","CCBY","23 Jan 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, there are very limited studies on the features of web APIs that make them more likely to be used and the issues of using web APIs in practice. Moreover, users’ expectations on the development and management of web APIs are rarely investigated. In this paper, we conduct a large-scale empirical study of 20,047 web APIs published at two popular and publicly accessible web API registries: ProgrammableWeb and APIs.guru. We first extract the questions posted in Stack Overflow (SO) that are relevant to the web APIs. We then manually analyze 1,885 randomly sampled SO questions and identify 24 web API issue types (e.g., authorization error) that are encountered by users. Afterwards, we conduct a user survey to investigate the features of web APIs that users often consider when shortlisting a web API for testing before they adopt it, validate the identified types of web API issues, and understand users’ expectations on the development and management of web APIs. From the 191 received responses, we extract 14 important features for users to decide whether to use a web API (e.g., well-organized documentation). We also gain a better understanding of web API issue types and summarize 11 categories of user expectations on web APIs (e.g., documentation and SDK/library). As the result of our study, we provide guidelines for web API developers and registry managers to improve web APIs and promote the use of web APIs.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2022.3154769","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62032025); National Research Foundation Singapore; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9723009","Web APIs;empirical study;user survey;stack overflow","Mashups;Feature extraction;Software development management;Software;Documentation;Companies;Testing","","4","","106","IEEE","28 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The valuable information from these medical crowdsourced Q&A websites can benefit patients, doctors and the society. One key to unleash the power of these Q&A websites is to extract medical knowledge from the noisy question-answer pairs and filter out unrelated or even incorrect information. Facing the daunting scale of information generated on medical Q&A websites everyday, it is unrealistic to fulfill this task via supervised method due to the expensive annotation cost. In this paper, we propose a Medical Knowledge Extraction (MKE) system that can automatically provide high-quality knowledge triples extracted from the noisy question-answer pairs, and at the same time, estimate expertise for the doctors who give answers on these Q&A websites. The MKE system is built upon a truth discovery framework, where we jointly estimate trustworthiness of answers and doctor expertise from the data without any supervision. We further tackle three unique challenges in the medical knowledge extraction task, namely representation of noisy input, multiple linked truths, and the long-tail phenomenon in the data. The MKE system is applied to real-world datasets crawled from xywy.com, one of the most popular medical crowdsourced Q&A websites. Both quantitative evaluation and case studies demonstrate that the proposed MKE system can successfully provide useful medical knowledge and accurate doctor expertise. We further demonstrate a real-world application, Ask A Doctor, which can automatically give patients suggestions to their questions.","2332-7790","","10.1109/TBDATA.2016.2612236","National Science Foundation(grant numbers:IIS-1553411); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7572985","Crowdsourced question answering;medical knowledge extraction;truth discovery","Medical services;Medical diagnostic imaging;Noise measurement;Big data;Data mining;Knowledge discovery","","21","","39","IEEE","21 Sep 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, we propose ALIMC, i.e., Activity Landmark-based Indoor Mapping system via Crowdsourcing. ALIMC can automatically construct indoor maps for anonymous buildings without any prior knowledge using crowdsourcing data collected by smartphones. ALIMC abstracts the indoor map using a link-node model in which the pathways are the links and the intersections of the pathways are the nodes, such as corners, elevators, and stairs. When passing through the nodes, pedestrians do the corresponding activities, which are detected by smartphones. After activity detection, ALIMC extracts the activity landmarks from the crowdsourcing data and clusters the activity landmarks into different clusters, each of which is treated as a node of the indoor map. ALIMC then estimates the relative distances between all the nodes and obtains a distance matrix. Based on the distance matrix, ALIMC generates a relative indoor map using the multidimensional scaling technique. Finally, ALIMC converts the relative indoor map into an absolute one based on several reference points. To evaluate ALIMC, we implement ALIMC in an office building. Experiment results show that the 80th percentile error of the mapping accuracy is about 0.8-1.5 m.","1558-0016","","10.1109/TITS.2015.2423326","Shenzhen Dedicated Funding of Strategic Emerging Industry Development Program(grant numbers:JCYJ20121019111128765); Shenzhen Scientific Research and Development Funding Program(grant numbers:ZDSY20121019111146499,JSGG20121026111056204,JCYJ20120817163755063,JCYJ20140418095735587,JCYJ20140828163633980); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:41371377,41201483,41301511,41401444,41401525); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(grant numbers:2013M542199,2014M560671); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7103327","Indoor mapping;activity landmark;crowdsourcing;smartphone;Indoor mapping;activity landmark;crowdsourcing;smartphone","IEEE 802.11 Standards;Smart phones;Crowdsourcing;Elevators;Legged locomotion;Turning","","97","","32","IEEE","7 May 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We proposed a smartphone probe car (SPC) system to monitor road pavement. An SPC is essentially an ordinary vehicle with a mounted smartphone that runs sensing programs to objectively assess bumping caused by road anomalies such as potholes and bumps. The proposed system has several features. First, to allow dynamic forming of SPCs, we develop a signal processing heuristic for the extraction of the vertical acceleration components from the accelerometer readings (upon which bumping detection and road surface anomaly assessment rely). By these means, the proposed system provides a driver-friendly environment, requiring neither complicated installation nor driver-assisted training processes, and thus is possible to achieve hassle-free mass deployment such that drivers would be willing to participate in crowdsourcing. Second, based on the underdamped oscillation model, we propose a road anomaly indexing heuristic that is representable for road anomalies rather than vehicle conditions. This will later facilitate the system-level data mining processes in the servers. Third, a prototype SPC system was implemented and extensive field tests were undertaken to verify the performance of our system framework. Furthermore, we experimentally adopted a DENCLUE-like algorithm to mine road anomaly information from reported events to demonstrate any potential benefit from future investigation of data mining process at the system level. We believe the research works introduced in this paper consist the first step toward building an “ecosystem” of SPC-based crowdsourcing traffic and road monitoring applications.","1558-0016","","10.1109/TITS.2014.2378511","Sinica(grant numbers:AS-102-TP-A06); Ministry of Science and Technology(grant numbers:NSC101-2628-E-009-014-MY3,NSC101-2628-E-009-014-MY3,NSC102-2918-I-009-002,MOST 103-2218-E-009-010,MOST 103-2218-E-009-021); Ministry of Education Aim for the Top University Plan; NCTU and ITRI Joint Research Center; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7056422","Crowdsourcing;mobile sensing;road pavement monitor;smartphone probe car (SPC);Crowdsourcing;mobile sensing;road pavement monitor;smartphone probe car (SPC)","Roads;Vehicles;Sensors;Monitoring;Vibrations;Feature extraction;Mobile communication","","97","","18","IEEE","9 Mar 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, we study a reliable task assignment problem for spatial crowdsourcing in a large worker market. Specifically, we use worker confidence to represent the reliability of successfully completing the assigned sensing tasks, and we formulate two optimization problems, maximum reliability assignment (MRA) under a recruitment budget and minimum cost assignment (MCA) under a task reliability requirement.

Our design objective is an optimal mechanism, i.e., one that maximizes the crowdsourcing revenue minus cost. To achieve this, we furnish the contest with a prize tuple which is an array of reward functions each for a potential winner. We prove and characterize the unique equilibrium of this contest, and solve the optimal prize tuple. In addition, this study discovers a counter-intuitive property, called strategy autonomy (SA), which means that heterogeneous workers behave independently of one another as if they were in a homogeneous setting. In game-theoretical terms, it says that an asymmetric auction admits a symmetric equilibrium. Not only theoretically interesting, but SA also has important practical implications on mechanism complexity, energy efficiency, crowdsourcing revenue, and system scalability. By scrutinizing seven mechanisms, our extensive performance evaluation demonstrates the superior performance of our mechanism as well as offers insights into the SA property.","1558-0660","","10.1109/TMC.2015.2485978","A*STAR; SERC(grant numbers:1224104046); US National Science Foundation(grant numbers:CNS-1404677,IIS-1404673,CNS-1545037,CNS-1545050); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7287773","Crowdsourcing;mobile crowd sensing;participatory sensing;strategy autonomy;all-pay auction;asymmetric auction","Crowdsourcing;Sensors;Mobile computing;Probabilistic logic;Mechanical factors;Mobile communication;Bayes methods","","58","","44","IEEE","2 Oct 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, we propose a decentralized location privacy-preserving SC for IoV, which allows vehicle users to securely participate in SC with ensuring the task's location policy privacy and providing multi-level privacy preservation for workers' locations. Specifically, we introduce blockchain technology into SC, which can eliminate the control of vehicle user data by SC-server. We combine the additively homomorphic encryption and circle-based location verification to ensure the confidentiality of task's location policy. To achieve multi-level privacy preservation for workers' driving locations, we only reveal a grid where workers are located in. The size of the grid represents the level of privacy preservation. We leverage the order-preserving encryption and non-interactive zero-knowledge proof to prevent workers from illegally obtaining rewards by forging their driving locations.

Quality control is a key design objective in incentive mechanisms for crowdsourcing as requesters aim at obtaining high-quality answers under a limited budget. However, when measuring workers' long-term quality, existing mechanisms either fail to utilize workers' historical information, or treat workers' quality as stable and ignore its temporal characteristics, hence performing poorly in a long run. In this paper we propose MELODY, a long-term dynamic quality-aware incentive mechanism for crowdsourcing. MELODY models interaction between requesters and workers as reverse auctions that run continuously. In each run of MELODY, we design a truthful, individual rational, budget feasible and quality-aware algorithm for task allocation with polynomial-time computation complexity and O(1) performance ratio. Moreover, taking into consideration the long-term characteristics of workers' quality, we propose a novel framework in MELODY for quality inference and parameters learning based on Linear Dynamical Systems at the end of each run, which takes full advantage of workers' historical information and predicts their quality accurately. Through extensive simulations, we demonstrate that MELODYoutperforms existing work in terms of both quality estimation (reducing estimation error by 17.6% ~ 24.2%) and social performance (increasing requester's utility by 18.2% ~ 46.6%) in long-term scenarios.","1558-2183","","10.1109/TPDS.2017.2775232","National Basic Research 973 Program of China(grant numbers:2015CB352403); National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)(grant numbers:61602301); NSFC/RGC Joint Research Scheme(grant numbers:N_PolyU519/12); NSFC Key(grant numbers:61332004); The Hong Kong Polytechnic University(grant numbers:1-ZE26); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8115213","Crowdsourcing;incentive mechanism;quality control;approximation algorithm;inference and learning","Crowdsourcing;Resource management;Quality control;Atmospheric measurements;Particle measurements;Inference algorithms","","56","","51","IEEE","20 Nov 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Thus in this work, we conduct pioneer investigation considering crowdsourced data quality.

Furthermore, to solve the multi-identity problem of users on multiple fog nodes, we propose an adaptive fog-blockchain reputation storage method, which efficiently reduces the system resource consumption by analyzing the adaptive classification of fog nodes.

In this paper, we investigate the problem of how to provide continuous incentives based on user's performances to encourage users' participation in the crowdsourcing, which can be referred to the moral hazard problem in the contract theory. We not only propose the one-dimensional performance-reward related contract, but also extend this basic model into the multi-dimensional contract. First, an incentive contract which rewards users by evaluating their performances from multiple dimensions is proposed. Then, the utility maximization problem of the principal in both one-dimension and multi-dimension are formulated. Furthermore, we detailed the analysis of the multi-dimensional contract to allocate incentives. Finally, we use the numerical results to analyze the optimal reward package, and compare the principal's utility under the different incentive mechanisms. Results demonstrate that by using the proposed incentive mechanism, the principal successfully maximizes the utilities, and the users obtain continuous incentives to participate in the crowdsourcing activity.","1558-0660","","10.1109/TMC.2017.2732982","NSF(grant numbers:CNS-1717454,CNS- 1731424,CNS-1702850,CNS-1646607,ECCS-1547201,CMMI-1434789,CNS-1443917,ECCS-1405121,CNS-1343361,CNS-1350230); Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea(NRF); Ministry of Education(grant numbers:NRF-2016R1D1A1B01015320); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7995145","Crowdsourcing;incentive mechanism;multi-dimension;moral hazard;contract theory","Crowdsourcing;Contracts;Google;Mobile computing;Ethics;Hazards;Smart phones","","43","","31","IEEE","28 Jul 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The process of site surveys is time-consuming and crowdsourcing is one feasible option to tackle this issue. Meanwhile, privacy protection has drawn concerns from both industry and academia. In this paper, we propose two incentive mechanisms to stimulate mobile users (MUs) to contribute indoor trajectory data for crowdsourcing-based indoor localization with differential privacy to prevent MUs' privacy leakage. The first mechanism considers fixed reward for MUs and incomplete information, where each MU's sensitivity level of the data privacy is unknown to the crowdsourcing platform (CP). The interaction between MUs and CP is formulated into a two-stage Stackelberg game to maximize MUs' utility and CP's profit. The second mechanism jointly considers the variable reward for MUs and assumes CP knows each MUs' sensitivity level of the data privacy. A demand function is used to model the relationship among CP, MUs, and service customer. The optimization problem of maximizing CP's profit is studied to show the impact of the price fluctuation. Comprehensive simulations are presented to evaluate the performance of the proposed mechanisms and show some insights of the crowdsourced indoor localization incentive mechanism with privacy protection.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2869202","China Scholarship Council(grant numbers:201706690030); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8457189","Crowdsourcing;indoor localization;incentive mechanism;game theory;privacy protection","Privacy;Trajectory;Crowdsourcing;Data privacy;Mobile handsets;Task analysis;Sensors","","30","","34","OAPA","11 Sep 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, we integrate the pricing and reputation schemes to design a novel socially optimal rating protocol based on game theory, in which each player is tagged with a rating to represent its social status, and players are encouraged to contribute good behaviors to increase their ratings, thus receive higher rewards. In particular, we analyze how the players' behaviors are influenced by the incurred costs and the designed payment, as well as their long-term utilities. By quantifying the sufficient and necessary conditions under which all players comply with the social norm in their self-interests, we formulate the rating protocol design problem, and analyze the impacts of the design parameters in order to characterize the optimal design, that maximizes the social welfare to achieve the social optimum.

Unlike the conventional SCs, the particularity of self-service in SSC may lead to unfinished tasks at the end of the entire assignment process, making a one-time assignment scheme ineffective. SSC is essentially an adaptive collaboration (AC) problem that requires a dynamic assignment strategy for a higher task completion rate. This article tackles this issue by establishing a quasi group role assignment (QGRA) based on a typical SSC scenario, that is, the photographing to make money problem (PMMP). First, it sheds light on a novel role awareness method, which can effectively divide tasks to accelerate the solution while, to some extent, raising the task completion rate. Second, it specifies an agent satisfaction evaluation (ASE) method to quantify the relationship between task completion rate and workers’ satisfaction. This method aims at considerably ameliorating task completion rate. Last, it extends QGRA with a new AC algorithm, which can achieve AC of the workers while accomplishing the crowdsourcing task. Moreover, utilizing the ASE method can help decision-makers balance the task completion rate and the workers’ satisfaction. Large-scale simulation experiments based on the real crowdsourced datasets exemplify the robustness and practicability of the proposed solutions.

One of the important issues in spatial crowdsourcing is task assignment, which allocates tasks to appropriate workers. However, existing works generally assume that no rejection would happen after the task assignment is completed by the server. Ignorance of such an operation can lead to low system throughput. Thus, in this paper, we take workers' rejection into consideration and try to maximize workers' acceptance in order to improve the system throughput. Specifically, we first formally define the problem of maximizing workers' acceptance in rejection-aware spatial crowdsourcing. Unfortunately, the problem is NP-hard. We propose two exact solutions to obtain the optimal assignment, but they are not efficient enough and not scalable for large inputs. Then, we present four approximation approaches for improving the efficiency. Finally, we show the effectiveness of the proposed pruning strategy for the exact solutions and the superiority of the proposed Greedy algorithm over other approximation methods through extensive experiments.","1558-2191","","10.1109/TKDE.2017.2676771","RGC(grant numbers:N_HKUST637/13); NSFC(grant numbers:U1301253,NSFC 61232018,NSFC 61328202); National Grand Fundamental Research 973 Program of China(grant numbers:2014CB340303); Microsoft Research; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7867824","Rejection-aware spatial crowdsourcing;acceptance maximization;greedy algorithm;local search","Crowdsourcing;Servers;Heuristic algorithms;Throughput;Dynamic programming;Mobile computing;Mobile communication","","25","","27","IEEE","1 Mar 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This paper proposes a supervised text sentiment classification method with Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to improve the classification performance of review text with fuzzy sentiment boundaries. Taking the review text of crowdsourcing participants on the Zhubajie platform as the data set, using N-gram, Word2vec, and TF-IDF algorithms to extract text features. The LDA topic model is applied to expand the number of text features and extract eight topics that affect employers’ sentiment tendencies. Text classifiers are constructed based on Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GDBT), and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) algorithms, and the effectiveness of the sentiment classification methods are verified by ten-fold cross-validation and confusion matrix. Experimental results show that using the LDA topic model to extend the features of review text can effectively alleviate the problem that the classifier is difficult to distinguish the sentiment categories of different emotion polarity words coexisting text, and enhance the ability of emotion boundary fuzzy text classification.

Although extensive research has been conducted on Wi-Fi fingerprint-based positioning, especially, in complex environments and long-term deployments, the automatic adaptation of radio map has not been fully studied and the problems remain open. When the positions of some Access Points (APs) change, the traditional approach regularly conducts site surveying which is time-consuming and labor-intensive. In this paper, we propose a crowdsourcing indoor positioning approach based on ensemble learning for automatic Altered APs Identification and Fingerprints Updating, namely AAIFU. We propose an algorithm to detect and identify the altered APs in crowdsourcing data. After getting the altered APs, we use the relationship between the received signal strength values of the altered APs and the unaltered APs in the crowdsourcing data to train a prediction model used to update the radio map. We also handle the device diversity on all the processes of AAIFU. Our proposed solution is light-weight which does not rely on additional infrastructure and inertial sensors with high power consumption. The comprehensive experiments have been carried out in our teaching building to evaluate the effectiveness of AAIFU. The results show that our proposed AAIFU can effectively adapt the radio map to the movement of APs and improve positioning accuracy. Correspondingly, we achieve an average positioning accuracy of 2.6m which outperforms the fingerprinting approach with the original radio map by 63.9%.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2901736","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61801189); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8653295","Indoor positioning;ensemble learning;radio map updating;crowdsourcing","Crowdsourcing;Sensors;Wireless fidelity;Fingerprint recognition;Smart phones;Prediction algorithms;Pattern matching","","22","","50","OAPA","26 Feb 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

On crowdsourcing platforms like Amazon MTurk or FigureEight, crowd workers select tasks to work on based on different dimensions such as task reward and requester reputation. Requesters then receive the judgments of workers who self-selected into the tasks and completed them successfully. Several crowd workers, however, preview tasks, begin working on them, reaching varying stages of task completion without finally submitting their work. Such behavior results in unrewarded effort which remains invisible to requesters. In this paper, we conduct an investigation of the phenomenon of task abandonment, the act of workers previewing or beginning a task and deciding not to complete it. We follow a three-fold methodology which includes 1) investigating the prevalence and causes of task abandonment by means of a survey over different crowdsourcing platforms, 2) data-driven analysis of logs collected during a large-scale relevance judgment experiment, and 3) controlled experiments measuring the effect of different dimensions on abandonment. Our results show that task abandonment is a widely spread phenomenon. Apart from accounting for a considerable amount of wasted human effort, this bears important implications on the hourly wages of workers as they are not rewarded for tasks that they do not complete. We also show how task abandonment may have strong implications on the use of collected data (for example, on the evaluation of Information Retrieval systems).","1558-2191","","10.1109/TKDE.2019.2948168","EU’s H2020 research and innovation programme(grant numbers:732328); Erasmus + project DISKOW(grant numbers:60171990); ARC Discovery Project(grant numbers:DP190102141); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8873609","Task abandonment;crowdsourcing;relevance judgments","Task analysis;Crowdsourcing;Focusing;Reliability;Web pages","","20","","47","IEEE","17 Oct 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Nonetheless, most existing incentive mechanisms assume a centralized platform for recruiting smartphones, which is prone to expose the privacy of both smartphones and task requesters. In this context, this article studies a distributed truthful incentive mechanism (DTIM) for mobile crowdsourcing, where multiple auction rounds can be conducted locally in each smartphone and task requester. Specifically, in each auction round, the participating smartphones act as the sellers and submit bids to compete for their intended crowdsourcing tasks. The task requesters, on the other hand, act as the buyers that decide on the sellers and corresponding payments, depending on their submitted bids. Finally, based on the offered payment, each smartphone selects a buyer for trading to optimize its utility. It is shown that the proposed incentive mechanism is strategy-proof, budget balanced, individually rational, and computationally efficient. Numerical results provided corroborate the beneficial properties of the scheme.","1939-9359","","10.1109/TVT.2020.2982243","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61872150,61872149); Ministry of Science and Technology of China(grant numbers:2018AAA0101300); Guangdong Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation(grant numbers:2020A1515011209); Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province(grant numbers:2018B030306010); Guangdong Special Support Program(grant numbers:2017TQ04X482); Pearl River S and T Nova Program of Guangzhou(grant numbers:201806010088); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9043743","Crowdsourcing;incentive mechanism;auction;strategy-proof;budget balance","Task analysis;Smart phones;Sensors;Mobile applications;Crowdsensing;Privacy","","20","","61","IEEE","20 Mar 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Encryption-based methods are the most direct way to protect the location, but not suitable for resource-limited devices. Besides, local differential privacy is a strong privacy concept and has been deployed in many software systems. However, the local differential privacy technology needs a large number of participants to ensure the accuracy of the estimation, which is not always the case for crowdsourcing. To solve this problem, we proposed a trie-based iterative statistic method, which combines additive secret sharing and local differential privacy technologies. The proposed method has excellent performance even with a limited number of participants without the need of complex computation. Specifically, the proposed method contains three main components: iterative statistics, adaptive sampling, and secure reporting.

Under this setting, the paper investigates a participant recruitment problem in which an initial set of recruited nodes, which we call seeds, need to make an optimal decision on what other nodes to recruit to perform the crowdsourcing task. These seeds face the dilemma that recruiting more nodes increases their own payment but on the other hand also increases the risk of being excluded from the crowdsourcing task. As a first attack to this problem, we propose a dynamic programming algorithm. However, it is a centralized solution and hence the practicality is compromised. Therefore, we introduce two distributed alternatives. One is based on the divide-and-conquer paradigm by first partitioning a network into a set of opportunistic Voronoi cells and then running an optimization algorithm in each cell. The other is a task-splitting scheme which recursively delegates the recruitment task to newly joined nodes. We implemented our proposed solutions on an Android-based prototype and built a testbed using 25 Dell Streak tablets. Our experiments which lasted for 24 days demonstrate that the distributed schemes approximate the theoretical optimum with affordable complexity. Moreover, we conducted simulations with a much larger scale and more diverse settings. The simulation results corroborate the experimental data and confirm that our proposed distributed solutions closely approach the performance of the centralized solution while satisfying the optimization goal under different network configurations.","1558-0660","","10.1109/TMC.2016.2524590","National Science Foundation(grant numbers:CNS-1528004); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7398086","Delay-constrained;single-copy multi-path;optimization;prototype;opportunistic network","Crowdsourcing;Mobile computing;Mobile nodes;Device-to-device communication;Delays","","20","","32","IEEE","3 Feb 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

By leveraging mutual friendship between computing entities (i.e., workers), collaborative tasks can thus be routed and finally fulfilled by multihop friends with high expertise. However, crowdsourcing in social IoT may reveal the privacy of task requesters which results in a large dilemma. In this paper, we focus on designing a multihop routing incentive mechanism which can also preserve task requester's privacy. Specifically, a utility maximization problem under privacy and budget feasibility constraints is formulated. Defining the conditions for privacy insurance, we give guidelines on how many subtasks should an entire task be divided into, and analyze the tradeoff between privacy and task accuracy. To enable efficient crowdsourcing task routing in social IoT, we first consider 1-hop myopic routing case and propose a near-optimal task assignment algorithm with 1/2 approximation ratio for an arbitrary prior knowledge. We further design multihop payment policy to establish an equilibrium where workers are motivated to forward subtasks to their friends with the best expertise. The extensive simulations validate that our mechanism achieves a high level of average information gain with modest privacy guarantee.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2019.2930659","National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program)(grant numbers:2017YFB1003000,2018YFB1004705,2018YFB2100302); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61672342,61671478,61602303,61532012,61822206,61829201); Science and Technology Innovation Program of Shanghai(grant numbers:17511105103,18510761200); Southeast University(grant numbers:2018D06); Shanghai Key Laboratory of Scalable Computing and Systems; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8770228","Crowdsourcing;incentive mechanism;privacy preserving;social Internet of Things (IoT);task assignment","Task analysis;Privacy;Crowdsourcing;Internet of Things;Routing;Collaboration;Reliability","","19","","45","IEEE","23 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, it is hard for users to find tasks that are suitable for them. Thus, many users participate in tasks, and they are not good at or not interested in, and give answers carelessly or randomly. This phenomenon causes heavy astroturfing problem in crowdsourcing systems, which not only hurts the quality of completing tasks, but also influences user experience. Therefore, recommendation mechanisms that can optimize the match between users and tasks are in demand. However, existing studies simply adopt users' expertise level or interest degree as the key rule for recommendation. They neglect the fact that interest and expertise function jointly, and that interest can sometimes exert reaction force on expertise. Besides, previous studies assume that users' interest degree is steady, yet ignoring that it is time-varying rather than static in real world. In this paper, we propose IntexCrowd, fine-grained recommendation mechanism through interest-expertise collaborative awareness for crowdsourcing systems, to curb astroturfing problem. First, the IntexCrowd assigns a topic to each task. Then, topic-specific expertise level as well as interest degree of users are estimated according to historical records of tasks. At last, suitable user lists for topic-specific tasks are suggested as recommendation results.

In this study, we consider the scenario where a mobile crowdsourcing platform aims to maximize the crowdsourcing revenue under a budget constraint, and users are interested in maximizing their utility while keeping their cost private. We design differentially-private mechanisms for such a scenario under an offline setting where users bid their costs simultaneously and under an online setting where user bids are revealed one by one.

In crowdsourcing systems, a centralized platform is traditionally used to allocate tasks and select workers. Centralized platforms always face following challenges: 1) How to ensure the rationality of tasks allocating; 2) How to ensure the payments of workers in the system when dishonest requesters exist; 3) How to ensure the maximum number of tasks are assigned. 4) How to ensure the integrity and reliability of the centralized platform. To solve these problems, this article proposed a distributed blockchain-based crowdsourcing framework - TSWCrowd (Task Select Worker Crowd). In this framework, tasks are sorted according to specific rules, thus tasks with higher priority are assigned to workers earlier. Workers who are available for a task will be selected and return a result. Then the deployed smart contracts will pay the basic payment automatically. At the same time, relevant contracts also calculate and pay the quality payment according to the proposed quality reward formulation. The proposed TSWCrowd framework on-chain involves a public dataset and uses solidity to compile the smart contracts. The framework was deployed on a local private blockchain. The decentralization property of the blockchain ensures the reliable assignment of tasks. Task-select-worker (TSW) algorithm sorts tasks to ensure reliability. In this paper, the proposed framework was compared with the ABCrowd auction mechanism on-chain and the VCG mechanism off-chain. The results show that the average distance is shorter and the payment is higher, thus reaches the reasonability, reliability and availability.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3043040","National Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61572325,60970012); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9285251","Blockchain;crowdsourcing;smart contracts;task management","Task analysis;Crowdsourcing;Blockchain;Resource management;Reliability;Privacy;Smart contracts","","16","","39","CCBY","7 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To improve data accuracy and cost-effectiveness, workers’ data quality can be learned from their data in an online manner, which can be used for task assignment and data aggregation. However, crowdsourcing is vulnerable to data poisoning attacks, where the attacker reports malicious data to reduce aggregated data accuracy. In this paper, we study malicious data attacks on dynamic crowdsourcing where tasks are assigned and performed sequentially, and we explore online quality learning as a defense mechanism against the attack by finding malicious workers with low quality. We first focus on the asymptotic setting where workers’ quality is accurately learned by the requester, based on which we then turn to the general non-asymptotic setting where the quality is estimated online with errors. For each setting, we first characterize the conditions under which the attack strategy can effectively reduce the aggregated data accuracy. Our results show that the malicious noise variance needs to be within a certain range for the attack to be effective. Then we analyze the harm of effective attack strategies. It reveals that the regret of the online quality learning algorithm can be substantially increased from $\mathcal {O}(\log ^2T)$O(log2T) (upper bound) to $\Omega (T)$Ω(T) (lower bound) due to effective attacks. To further mitigate the attack, we also study median and maximum influence of estimation based data aggregation as defense mechanisms. Our results provide useful insights on the impacts of data poisoning attacks when online quality learning is used to defend against the attack.

Based on social influences, we design incentive mechanisms with the goal of achieving high quality of crowdsourced data and low cost of incentivizing users’ participation. Specifically, we consider three scenarios. In the full information scenario, we design task assignment and user recruitment mechanisms to optimize the data quality while reducing the incentive cost. In the partial information scenario, users’ qualities and costs are unknown. We exploit the correlation between tasks to overcome the information asymmetry, for both cases of opportunistic crowdsourcing and participatory crowdsourcing.

Furthermore, members of a crowd may sometimes return incorrect answers with different probabilities. Accuracy rates of individual crowd workers can be attributes of CCQs as well as evaluations of individual workers.

It works efficiently with Word of Mouth Mode (WoM), especially for sensing tasks with time and location constraints, since the sensing task can be spread quickly among mobile contributors in the WoM mode. In this paper, we first investigate the behaviors of contributors, categorize all contributors into four types according to their different behaviors, and propose an inviting algorithm for contributors to recruit cooperators through social closeness. Then, we design a reward mechanism for crowdsourcing platform to evaluate the budget and pay the reward to contributors, meanwhile stimulate contributors to make the maximum contribution.

Unlike traditional crowdsourcing, SC outsources tasks to distributed potential workers, and those who accept the task are required to travel to a predefined location to complete it. Currently, the primary aim of SC is to maximize the number of matched tasks or to minimize the travelling distances of the workers. However, less focus is given in matching the right tasks to the right workers, particularly in a heterogeneous tasks environment. To address this lacking, our work provides an efficient framework for selecting optimal workers for every task with various specification (geographical proximity, domain types, and expiration times), based on workers' attributes (task domain-specific knowledge, expertise or performance history, distance to task location, and task workload distribution). We introduce the use of Bayesian Network in modelling and selecting optimal workers, and use k-medoids partitioning technique for tasks clustering and scheduling. Our experimental results on both synthetic and real-world large datasets have shown that our proposed approach has outperformed other baseline approaches, in terms of low average error rate and fast execution time.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3005543","University of Malaya Research Grant(grant numbers:RP032D-16SBS); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9127467","Spatial crowdsourcing;worker selection;Bayesian network;task allocation;task matching accuracy;computational efficiency","Task analysis;Crowdsourcing;Resource management;Bayes methods;Servers;Real-time systems;Greedy algorithms","","11","","43","CCBY","29 Jun 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Existing incentive mechanisms are not effective to avoid socially undesirable equilibrium due to the following features of competitive crowdsourcing: in the presence of imperfect monitoring, heterogeneous workers with competing interest tend to beat their opponents for larger self-profit, and the fact that they can freely and frequently change their opponents makes the situation much more complicated. Taking these features into consideration, this article proposes a mechanism design problem to enforce cooperation and extort selfish works simultaneously, with the objective of maximizing the requester’s utility. To solve the problem, we integrate binary ratings with differential pricing to develop a novel rating protocol. By establishing a mathematical model for the problem and quantifying necessary and sufficient conditions for a sustainable social norm, we provide design guidelines for optimal rating protocols and design a low-complexity algorithm to select optimal design parameters.

In this paper, we analyze the attack problem using an iterated prisoner's dilemma (IPD) game and propose a reward-penalty expected payoff algorithm based on zero-determinant (ZD) strategies to reward a worker's cooperation or penalize its defection in order to entice the final cooperation. Both theoretical analysis and simulation studies are performed, and the results indicate that the proposed algorithm has the following two attractive characteristics: 1) the requestor can incentivize the worker to become cooperative without any long-term extra cost; and 2) the proposed algorithm is fair so that the requestor cannot arbitrarily penalize an innocent worker to increase its payoff even though it can dominate the game. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to adopt the ZD strategies to stimulate both players to cooperate in an IPD game.

However, in order to make efficient assignments, the existing spatial crowdsourcing system usually requires workers and/or tasks to expose their locations, which raises a significant concern of compromising location privacy. In addition, traditional spatial crowdsourcing systems employ a centralized server to manage the information of workers and tasks. Such a centralized design does not scale to a large number of workers/tasks, making the server easily a bottleneck. In this article, we present an online framework for assigning tasks to workers without compromising the location privacy in a fully distributed manner.

In this article, we innovatively propose a reliable fog-based temporal-spatial crowdsourcing for serving the above tasks. In this scenario, the key point is to achieve the best match of the attributes among tasks, fog nodes, and workers. As the bridge of the other two parts, fog nodes determine the orientation of tasks. Therefore, we present a temporal-spatial task allocation (TS-TA) scheme in the fog layer, aiming to make task results more reliable. In this scheme, we build a temporal-spatial attribute learning model based on the user behaviors. Then, we use the users' interest attribute matching model to identify the candidate fog nodes that satisfy the requirements of temporal-spatial tasks. We choose the fog nodes with low spatial correlation that is benefit to defense the attack on the nodes in the intensive area. Meanwhile, we assign the redundancy nodes for intrusion response through replacing the attacked/negative node. Both theoretical and real-topology simulation results validate that the proposed scheme can get better performance in system resource consumption and system robustness compared with other benchmark schemes.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2019.2957035","National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program)(grant numbers:2017YFE0125300,2018YFB1702000); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61771120); project of PCL Future Regional Network Facilities for Large-scale Experiments and Applications(grant numbers:PCL2018KP001); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:N171602002,N181613003); Visiting Scholar Program of China Scholarship Council(grant numbers:201906085031); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8918307","Fog-based mobile crowdsourcing;interest attribute;Internet of Things (IoT);reliable task allocation;temporal–spatial tasks","Task analysis;Crowdsourcing;Resource management;Computer architecture;Reliability;Monitoring;Internet of Things","","10","","26","IEEE","2 Dec 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To address this issue, we first introduce a novel blockchain-enabled crowdsourcing platform that integrates the functions of task assignment and resource lending via two dedicated smart contracts. Second, to ensure financial stability in the blockchain-enabled market and to match the difficulty of the received tasks with the ability of the workers, we design a dynamic, hierarchical pricing mechanism based on economic modeling methods and heterogeneous agent theory. With this mechanism, the market is divided dynamically into multiple levels according to the remuneration of the customers' offer and the market value of the workers' resources. Additional constraints are proposed to avoid possible malicious trading behavior from workers in the resource lending process. We prove theoretically the rationality of our model and demonstrate the dynamics of the model. We show that the market price and demand can be convergent and test the cost of executing the two smart contracts. Finally, extensive experimental results demonstrate the correctness and feasibility of the platform and confirm that the hierarchical pricing mechanism can maintain the stability of the market.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2020.3007268","National Key Research and Development Plan(grant numbers:2018YFB1003803); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61802450,61722214); Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong(grant numbers:2018A030313005); Program for Guangdong Introducing Innovative and Entrepreneurial Teams(grant numbers:2017ZT07X355); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9134418","Blockchain-enabled market;financial stability;hierarchical pricing;smart contract;software crowdsourcing","Crowdsourcing;Task analysis;Blockchain;Stability analysis;Pricing;Smart contracts","","10","","39","IEEE","7 Jul 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Although with significant importance, the traditional signal map construction, e.g., through full site survey, could be time-consuming and labor-intensive as the signal varies frequently over time and the accuracy requirement grows rapidly with the emergence of new applications. The state-of-the arts usually employ crowdsourcing scheme and matrix completion algorithm to solve the dilemma. However, the crowdsourcing scheme usually suffers from uneven distributed and inadequate participants, while the matrix completion methods do not take the specific signal map features into account, thus suffering from sub-optimal recovery results. To this end, in this paper, we study how to effectively reconstruct and update the signal map in the case of partially measured signal maps with smaller cost and propose a GAN-based active signal map reconstruction method (GSMAC). Our method is mainly innovative in two parts: GSMC, GAN-based signal map construction, and ACS, an active crowdsourcing scheme. Specifically, GSMC can effectively update the signal map with only a small number of observations while also fully using the incomplete historical signals to effectively update the signal map online. Meanwhile, ACS consists of a reinforce learning-based active query mechanism which quantitatively evaluates the most valuable measurement site for reconstruction, which further reduces the measurement cost to minimum. The simulation results and real implemented data driven experiments demonstrate the advantages and effectiveness of our approach in both accuracy and cost.","1558-0660","","10.1109/TMC.2021.3120057","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2019YFB2102000); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62172215,62071230,61872175,61832008); Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province(grant numbers:BK20200067,BK20211567); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62061146002); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9573345","Signal map;mobile crowdsensing;generative adversarial network;crowdsourcing;reinforcement learning;matrix completion","Costs;Sensors;Generative adversarial networks;Task analysis;Crowdsensing;Computational modeling;Compressed sensing","","10","","49","IEEE","14 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

With the rapid development of mobile network and the sharing economy model, spatio-temporal crowdsourcing technology has been research hotspot. Task assignment is one of the core issues of spatio-temporal crowdsourcing technology. There are three algorithms: Random Algorithm, Random-Threshold-Based Algorithm (RT) and Adaptive random-threshold-based Algorithm (Adaptive RT) for maximizing the total utility in the online task assignment of three types of objects, tasks, workers and workplaces. But these algorithms ignore the distance cost and fairness between task requester and workers. Unfairness means that higher task’s reward with lower worker’s success ratio or lower task’s reward with higher worker’s success ratio in a match. Therefore, this paper proposes Quality Constraint Algorithm (QCA), which quantifies fairness between task requester and workers as match quality and adopts a matching strategy of automatic negotiation on task’s reward to improve the average match quality. QCA not only has higher average match quality and higher total utility, but also optimizes the average distance cost. Compared with Adaptive RT, QCA has an average increment of 11% on total utility, an average increment of 19% on average match quality and an average decrease of 17% on distance cost.

Existing studies generally assume that all users are trustworthy and can reliably perform assigned tasks. However, such assumptions do not hold in real-world practices. In this article, we consider an essential crowdsourcing problem, namely Reliability-oriented Socially-Aware Crowdsourcing (R-SAC), which improves the reliability by recruiting users who are better matched to the tasks. Our R-SAC problem is to recruit reliable users for multiple cooperative tasks so that the overall reliability of task assignment is maximized. We prove that the R-SAC problem is $\mathcal {NP}$NP-hard. Then, we propose an approximation algorithm with a factor of $\ln {m} + 1$lnm+1 to solve the R-SAC problem, where $m$m is the number of tasks. Specifically, user reliability refers to the probability that a user can reliably perform assigned tasks. To achieve reliable user recruitment during task assignment, we formulate the reliability of a user by combining the matching between the user and tasks, and the reliability feedback from neighbors who share similar behaviors with the user in the social network. Besides, the distributed collaborative filtering technique is utilized to select the reliability feedback from the neighbors. We evaluate the performance of our proposed approach experimentally on two widely-used real-world datasets and the results demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms five representative approaches.","1939-1374","","10.1109/TSC.2021.3103636","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61672022,U1904186); Collaborative Innovation Platform of Electronic Information Master of Shanghai Polytechnic University(grant numbers:A10GY21F015); Australian Research Council(grant numbers:DP180100212,DP200102491); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9511303","Spatial crowdsourcing;task assignment;reliability-oriented;influence propagation;approximation algorithm","Task analysis;Reliability;Crowdsourcing;Social networking (online);Recruitment;Approximation algorithms;Software reliability","","7","","42","IEEE","10 Aug 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To improve the quality of labels, requesters usually let one task be independently completed by a group of heterogeneous crowdsourced workers. Then, the true values of the multiple labels of each task are inferred from these repeated noisy labels. In this paper, we propose two novel probabilistic models MCMLI and MCMLD to address the multi-class multi-label inference problem in crowdsourcing. MCMLI assumes that the labels of each task are mutually independent and MCMLD utilizes a mixture of multiple independently multinoulli distributions to capture the correlation among the labels. Both models can jointly infer multiple true labels of each instance as well as estimate the reliability of crowdsourced workers modeled by a set of confusion matrices with an expectation-maximization algorithm. Experiments with three typical crowdsourcing scenarios and a real-world dataset show that our proposed models significantly outperform existing competitive alternatives. When the labels are strongly correlated, MCMLD substantially outperforms MCMLI. Furthermore, our models can be easily simplified to the one-coin models, which show more advantageous when errors are uniformly distributed, or labels are sparse.","1558-2191","","10.1109/TKDE.2019.2951668","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2016YFB1000901); Ministry of Education, China(grant numbers:IRT17R32); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:91846104,91746209,61603186); Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province(grant numbers:BK20160843); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(grant numbers:2017T100370); University Prominent Young & Middle-aged Teachers and Presidents; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8892650","Crowdsourcing;maximum likelihood estimation;mixture models;probabilistic graphical models;statistical inference","Crowdsourcing;Probabilistic logic;Correlation;Task analysis;Reliability;Inference algorithms;Hidden Markov models","","7","","50","IEEE","6 Nov 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In order to address this issue, the crowdsourcing approach has been recently adopted, where the fingerprint database is frequently updated via user reporting. These crowdsourcing techniques still require precise indoor floor plans and fail to provide satisfactory accuracy. In this paper, we propose a low-complexity self-calibrating indoor crowdsourcing localization system that combines historical fingerprints with frequently updated fingerprints for high precision user positioning.

We study, for the first time, implicit multimodal crowdsourcing for joint RF and geomagnetic fingerprinting. The scheme, termed UbiFin, exploits the spatial correlation among RF, geomagnetic, and motion signals to mitigate the impact of sensor noise, leading to highly accurate and robust fingerprinting without the need for any explicit manual intervention. Using clustering and dynamic programming, UbiFin correlates spatially different signals and filters effectively mislabeled signals. We conduct extensive experiments on our campus and a large multi-story shopping mall.

For such a goal, we propose a Self-play and Sentiment-Emphasized Comment Integration Framework (SSECIF), based on deep Q-learning, with three unique features. First, our framework SSECIF can generate the comment integration in a totally self-play way, without relying on the ground truth generated by human effort. Second, the integrated comment generated by SSECIF can include salient content with low redundancy. Third, the proposed framework SSECIF has emphasized, with a higher intensity, the sentiment in the integrated comment, in order to reflect the attitude or opinion more obviously.

In a crowdsourcing platform for healthcare, patients can act as requesters who recruit workers, such as doctors, to provide professional advice by posting a task. However, privacy concerns pose a significant obstacle for patients willing to participate in crowdsourcing, as task data often contain sensitive personal information. To address this issue, we propose a novel attribute-based, lightweight, and dynamic fine-grained worker selection scheme, called ABCrowdMed, with privacy-preserving features. With this scheme, requesters can select workers in a non-interactive way by using a novel CP-ABE scheme that incorporates online/offline encryption, verifiable outsourcing decryption, revocation, and hidden policy properties. Additionally, requesters can revoke and update their tasks by withdrawing some workers’ decryption privileges. Participants can also release the computation burden with the aid of a third-party server. The proposed scheme’s security has been proven to be selectively secure under the decisional $ (q-1)$(q-1) assumption and satisfies forward/backward security.

Unfortunately, most data cleaning models aim to probe the exact values of the objects individually and therefore do not work well for subjective data types, such as user ratings, which are inherently probabilistic. In this paper, we propose a novel pairwise crowdsourcing model to reduce the uncertainty of top-k ranking using a crowd of domain experts. Given a crowdsourcing task of limited budget, we propose efficient algorithms to select the best object pairs for crowdsourcing that will bring in the highest quality improvement.

In online situation, we need to consider both the varying service of workers and future unknown task arrivals. As we know, none of the previous work considers a multi-dimensional large-scale task assignment for utility maximization. In this paper, an online framework is proposed to solve this optimization problem by running atomic tasks in parallel on workers. To estimate worker service rates, we consider each varying worker as an arm for a multi-armed bandit in crowdsourcing system.

A task aggregation scheme is generally employed in crowdsourcing systems, to deal with this problem. Existing methods mainly focus on structured submissions and also do not consider the cost incurred for completing a task. We exploit features of submissions to improve the task aggregation for proposing a method which is applicable to both structured and unstructured tasks. Moreover, existing probabilistic methods for answer aggregation are sensitive to sparsity. Our approach uses a generative probabilistic model that incorporates similarity in answers along with worker and task features.

The results reveal that high web-specific computer self-efficacy and harmonious work climate positively influence individuals’ sustained participation intention; reasonable task recommendation and positive feedback are significant predictors of high web-specific computer self-efficacy; effective cooperation, fair competition, and positive feedback affect a harmonious work climate.

A fundamental issue of spatial crowdsourcing is online task assignment, i.e., the platform must make decisions immediately (assign or reject) for newly arriving objects (tasks or workers). Previous studies mostly focus on the rejection-aware assignment, which rarely considers non-rejection assignment for new arrival objects. To solve this new allocation model, in this paper, we first formulate a novel problem, namely Online Non-rejection aware Task Assignment (ONRTA) in spatial crowdsourcing, where an object cannot be rejected by the platform as long as there is a neighbor that satisfies the matching constraint with it. Then, we develop a non-rejection threshold-based random algorithm ONRTA-RT under the adversarial order model while obtaining a theoretical bound on the competitive ratio. More importantly, we consider a more natural random order model and propose a two-stage-based non-rejection aware task assignment approach, ONRTA-Base, which achieves a competitive ratio of $\frac{1}{4}$14. Based on this framework, we further devise two non-rejection assignment approaches, ONRTA-OP and ONRTA-Greedy, which are more effective and run faster with a competitive ratio of $\frac{1}{4}$14 and $\frac{1}{8}$18, respectively. Finally, experiments on synthetic and real datasets demonstrate that our proposed methods outperform the representative methods.","1939-1374","","10.1109/TSC.2023.3327858","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61972161); Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation of Guangdong Province(grant numbers:2022A1515010374); Guangzhou Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation(grant numbers:202201010715); Key-Area Research and Development Program of Guangdong Province of China(grant numbers:2021B0101190002); RGC Grant for Theme-based Research Scheme Project(grant numbers:T43-513/23-N); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10297588","Non-rejection aware;task assignment;online matching;spatial crowdsourcing","Task analysis;Resource management;Crowdsourcing;Time factors;Benchmark testing;Software engineering;Urban areas","","","","42","IEEE","26 Oct 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

An important stage of crowdsourcing is to select trustworthy workers. Workers’ reputation, as an essential criterion of this selection, is usually evaluated by feedback ratings from requesters. However, the reputation in the crowdsourcing-based indoor navigation system is vulnerable to the collusion attack, that is malicious workers (i.e., attackers) collude with requesters to illegally increase reputation. In this paper, we propose a collusion detection scheme to distinguish attackers and provide a secure reputation mechanism. Specifically, we first identify collusive requesters categorized into three different levels according to their feedback rating behaviors. Then, the weighted logistic regression (WLR) is developed to distinguish the collusive requesters who provide exorbitant feedback ratings. Furthermore, we employ an outlying sequence detection based on the maximum mean discrepancy (MMD), to resist the multiple location queries initiated by the same collusive requester through analyzing the distribution distance. In addition, we propose a community detection algorithm, named Fastgreedy, to identify the collusion from many requesters. Finally, the extensive simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme can effectively detect collusive requesters and significantly outperform other methods.","1941-0018","","10.1109/TDSC.2022.3197639","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:U1936213,61872230); Program of Shanghai Academic Research Leader(grant numbers:21XD1421500); Science and Technology Commission of Shanghai Municipality(grant numbers:20020500600); Shanghai Rising-Star Program(grant numbers:22QA1403800); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9866047","Collusion detection;reputation;indoor navigation system;spatial crowdsourcing","Crowdsourcing;Indoor navigation;Navigation;Behavioral sciences;Servers;Global Positioning System;Detectors","","","","45","IEEE","24 Aug 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Unfortunately, contributions to these forums are often unclear and incomplete. Docker is a container solution that enables software developers to encapsulate an operating environment and could help address reproducibility issues. This artile reports on a feasibility study to evaluate if Docker can help improve reproducibility in Stack Overflow. We started surveying Stack Overflow users to understand their perceptions on the proposal of using Docker to reproduce Stack Overflow posts. Participants were critical and mentioned two important aspects: cost and need. To validate their criticism, we conducted an exploratory study focused on understanding how costly the task of creating containers for posts is for developers. Overall, results indicate that the cost of creating containers is not high, especially due to the fact that dockerfiles are highly similar and small. Based on these findings we developed a tool, dubbed Frisk, to assist developers in creating containers for those posts. We then conducted a user study to evaluate interest of Stack Overflow developers on the tool. We found that, on average, users spent nearly ten minutes interacting with Frisk and that 45.3% of the 563 Frisk sessions we created for existing posts resulted in a successful access to the corresponding web service by the owners of the post. Overall, this artile provides early evidence that the use of Docker in Q&A forums should be encouraged for configuration-related posts.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2019.2956919","INES 2.0; Fundação de Amparo à Ciência e Tecnologia do Estado de Pernambuco(grant numbers:PRONEX APQ 0388-1.03/14,APQ-0399-1.03/17); Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior(grant numbers:88887.136410/2017-00); Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico(grant numbers:465614/2014-0); FACEPE/CAPES(grant numbers:PBPG-1175-1.03/16); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8918334","Container;docker;issue reproducibility;community question answering;tool support","Containers;Servers;Tools;Web services;Proposals;Electronic mail","","4","","57","IEEE","2 Dec 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, when the participating clients implement an uncoordinated computation strategy, the difficulty is to handle the communication efficiency (i.e., the number of communications per iteration) while exchanging the model parameters during aggregation. Therefore, a key challenge in FL is how users participate to build a high-quality global model with communication efficiency. We tackle this issue by formulating a utility maximization problem, and propose a novel crowdsourcing framework to leverage FL that considers the communication efficiency during parameters exchange. First, we show an incentive-based interaction between the crowdsourcing platform and the participating client's independent strategies for training a global learning model, where each side maximizes its own benefit. We formulate a two-stage Stackelberg game to analyze such scenario and find the game's equilibria.

As wireless communication is susceptible to various kinds of threats and attacks, remote user authentication is highly essential for a hazard-free use of these services. In this paper, we aim to propose a new secure three-factor user remote user authentication protocol based on the extended chaotic maps. The three factors involved in the proposed scheme are: 1) smart card; 2) password; and 3) personal biometrics. As the proposed scheme avoids computationally expensive elliptic curve point multiplication or modular exponentiation operation, it is lightweight and efficient. The formal security verification using the widely-accepted verification tool, called the ProVerif 1.93, shows that the presented scheme is secure. In addition, we present the formal security analysis using the both widely accepted real-or-random model and Burrows-Abadi-Needham logic.

The emergence of the blockchain technology brings in high hopes for fulfilling most of those requirements. However, a major challenge is to find a proper consensus protocol that is applicable to the crowdsourcing services in particular and online services in general. Building upon the idea of using blockchain as the underlying technology to enable tracing transactions for service contracts and dispute arbitration, this paper proposes a novel consensus protocol that is suitable for the crowdsourcing as well as the general online service industry. The new consensus protocol is called “Proof-of-Trust” (PoT) consensus; it selects transaction validators based on the service participants' trust values while leveraging RAFT leader election and Shamir's secret sharing algorithms. The PoT protocol avoids the low throughput and resource intensive pitfalls associated with Bitcoin' s “Proof-of-Work” (PoW) mining, while addressing the scalability issue associated with the traditional Paxos-based and Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT)-based algorithms. In addition, it addresses the unfaithful behaviors that cannot be dealt with in the traditional BFT algorithms. The paper demonstrates that our approach can provide a viable accountability solution for the online service industry.","1939-1374","","10.1109/TSC.2018.2823705","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8332496","Accountability;blockchain;byzantine agreement;crowdsourcing;consensus;PoT;PoW;PoS","Protocols;Crowdsourcing;Bitcoin;Contracts;Scalability","","139","","39","IEEE","6 Apr 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Motivated by the idea of active learning, an adaptive dropout deep computation model (ADDCM) with crowdsourcing to cloud is proposed for industrial IoT big data feature learning in this paper. First, a distribution function is designed to set the dropout rate for each hidden layer to prevent overfitting for the deep computation model. Furthermore, the outsourcing selection algorithm based on the maximum entropy is employed to choose appropriate samples from the training set to crowdsource on the cloud platform. Finally, an improved supervised learning from multiple experts scheme is presented to aggregate answers given by human workers and to update the parameters of the ADDCM simultaneously. Extensive experiments are conducted to evaluate the performance of the presented model by comparing with the dropout deep computation model and other state-of-the-art crowdsourcing algorithms.

Crowdsourcing-based fingerprint collection is cost efficient because of user participation, but its accuracy is questioned due to the noisy sample locations. In this paper, we present a probabilistic radio map construction scheme with crowdsourcing collection, considering both accuracy and survey costs. In particular: 1) based on further studies of RSS properties, we introduce a concept of unfixed data collection-in which sample locations are estimated by an additional localization mechanism-and verify its effectiveness, although sample locations are noisy; 2) we present a modified parametric fitting method to better describe location signatures by transforming RSS into signal envelope; and 3) we propose a clustering-based space partitioning algorithm to improve the fitting effect by reducing the number of multimodal distributions. Extensive simulations and experiments show the proposed method can construct an accurate radio map at a low cost, and achieve a localization accuracy of about 2.5 m, 20% improvement compared to using the classical radio map in our experimental scenario.","1558-1748","","10.1109/JSEN.2016.2535250","Tianjin Research Program of Application Foundation and Advanced Technology(grant numbers:15JCQNJC41900); Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61401301); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7420537","crowdsourcing;fingerprint localization;statistical distribution;radio map;received signal strength;Crowdsourcing;fingerprint localization;statistical distribution;radio map;received signal strength","Probabilistic logic;Noise measurement;Sensors;Fingerprint recognition;Clustering algorithms;Partitioning algorithms;Mobile communication","","84","","38","IEEE","26 Feb 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This paper investigates the use of reference sets with predetermined ground-truth to monitor annotators' accuracy and fatigue, all in real-time.

This paper focuses on crowdsourcing complex tasks by team formation in social networks (SNs) where a requester connects to a large number of workers. A good indicator of efficient team collaboration is the social connection among workers. Most previous social team formation approaches, however, either assume that the requester can maintain information of all workers and can directly communicate with them to build teams, or assume that the workers are cooperative and be willing to join the specific team built by the requester, both of which are impractical in many real situations. To this end, this paper first models each worker as a selfish entity, where the requester prefers to hire inexpensive workers that require less payment and workers prefer to join the profitable teams where they can gain high revenue. Within the noncooperative SNs, a distributed negotiation-based team formation mechanism is designed for the requester to decide which worker to hire and for the worker to decide which team to join and how much should be paid for his skill service provision. The proposed social team formation approach can always build collaborative teams by allowing team members to form a connected graph such that they can work together efficiently. Finally, we conduct a set of experiments on real dataset of workers to evaluate the effectiveness of our approach. The experimental results show that our approach can: 1) preserve considerable social welfare by comparing the benchmark centralized approaches and 2) form the profitable teams within less negotiation time by comparing the traditional distributed approaches, making our approach a more economic option for real-world applications.","2168-2275","","10.1109/TCYB.2016.2602498","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61170164,61472079,71201077); Funds for Distinguished Young Scholars of the Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province(grant numbers:BK2012020); Collaborative Innovation Center of Novel Software Technology and Industrialization; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7562443","Crowdsourcing;multiagent;negotiation;noncooperative;social networks (SNs);team formation","Crowdsourcing;Social network services;Teamwork;Computer science;Cybernetics;Multi-agent systems","","68","","50","IEEE","7 Sep 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A critical problem that arises in current crowdsourcing mechanisms is how to ensure that users pay or receive what they deserve. Free-riding and false-reporting may make the system vulnerable to dishonest users. In this paper, we design schemes to tackle these problems, so that each individual in the system is better off being honest and each provider prefers completing the assigned task. We first design a mechanism EFF which eliminates dishonest behavior with the help from a trusted third party for arbitration. We then design another mechanism DFF which, without the help from any third party, discourages dishonest behavior. We also prove that DFF is semi-truthful, which discourages dishonest behavior such as free-riding and false-reporting when the rest of the individuals are honest, while guaranteeing transaction-wise budget-balance and computational efficiency. Performance evaluation shows that within our mechanisms, no user could have a utility gain by unilaterally being dishonest.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2015.2441031","ARO(grant numbers:W911NF-09-1-0467,W911NF-13-1-0349); NSF(grant numbers:1217611,1218203,1420881,1421685,1444059); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7117344","Crowdsourcing;free-riding;false-reporting;game theory;incentive mechanisms;Crowdsourcing;false-reporting;free-riding;game theory;incentive mechanisms","Crowdsourcing;Games;Warranties;Computational modeling;Internet of things;Game theory;Mobile communication","","60","","37","IEEE","3 Jun 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Worker's historical performance data are recorded at local fog server, based on which valuable workers are identified and selected to perform the tasks. During worker selection, we aim at balancing the exploration and exploitation, and propose an online algorithm that promotes workers who are not fully explored.

Unfortunately, not everyone is willing to participate in sensing tasks or provide high-quality information. Offering incentives is a common method of increasing the success of CS. Existing incentive mechanisms based on auction models lack deep consideration regarding the effects of malicious competition behavior and the “free-riding” phenomenon in crowdsourcing services. The design proposed in this paper focuses on an incentive mechanism based on a reverse auction. First, the crowdsourcing system incentive model is built. Second, an incentive mechanism is proposed based on an auction which combines the concepts of reverse auctions and Vickrey auctions. Next, proof that the mechanism is computationally efficient, individually rational, budget-balanced, truthful, and honest is provided.

First, CLRIC filters the high-precision GPS data from the raw trajectories based on region growing clustering with prior knowledge. Second, CLRIC mines the number and locations of traffic lanes through optimized constrained Gaussian mixture model.

In parallel with the development of online centralized platforms, we look into the realization of self-organized mobile crowdsourcing drawing on opportunistic networks, and propose the Crowd Foraging framework, in which a mobile task requester can proactively recruit a massive crowd of opportunistic encountered mobile workers in real time for quick and high-quality results. We present a comprehensive framework model that fully integrates human behavior factors for modeling task profile, worker arrival, and work ability, and then introduce a service quality concept to indicate the expected service gain that a requester can enjoy when she recruits an arrival worker by jointly considering the work ability of workers as well as timeliness and reward of tasks. Furthermore, we formulate a sequential worker recruitment problem as an online multiple stopping problem to maximize the expected sum of service quality, and accordingly derive an optimal worker recruitment policy through the dynamic programming principle, which exhibits a nice threshold-based structure. We provide data-driven case studies to validate the assumptions used in the policy design, and conduct extensive trace-driven numerical evaluations, which demonstrate that our policy can achieve superior performance (e.g., improve more than 30% performance over classic policies). Besides, our Android prototype shows that the Crowd Foraging framework is cost-efficient, such as requiring less than 7 s and 6 J in terms of time and energy consumption for the optimal threshold calculation in our policy in most cases.","1558-0008","","10.1109/JSAC.2017.2679598","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2016YFB0201900); Start-Up Fund from Sun Yat-Sen University; EU FP7 IRSES MobileCloud Project(grant numbers:612212); EU-Japan Horizon2020 ICN2020 Project through EU(grant numbers:723014); NICT(grant numbers:184); Alexander Humboldt Foundation; Natural Science Foundation of Tianjin, China(grant numbers:16JCQNJC00700); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7874185","Mobile crowdsourcing;service quality;worker recruitment;opportunistic networks","Mobile communication;Crowdsourcing;Recruitment;Mobile computing;Quality of service;Device-to-device communication;Sensors","","37","","32","IEEE","8 Mar 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The main feature of SMCS is the presence of spatial tasks that require workers to be physically present at a particular location for task fulfillment. These tasks usually take advantage of the built-in sensors in mobile devices by requesting environment sensing services. Because cameras are becoming the most common way for visual logging techniques and sensing in our daily lives, we propose, in this article, a photo-based SMCS framework for event reporting. The proposed framework allows event report requesters to solicit photos of ongoing events and keep track of any updates. We propose a full architecture in which we solve the SMCS recruitment problem using different fairness strategies in the presence of multiple events and reporters. Then, once submissions are received and before forwarding final responses to event requesters, we proceed with a data processing phase for data quality monitoring. In short, our event reporting platform helps requesters recruit ideal reporters, select highly relevant data from an evolving picture stream, and receive accurate responses. This solution mainly incorporates: 1) a strategic and generic recruitment algorithm for recruiting and scheduling suitable reporters to events; 2) a deep learning model that eliminates false submissions and ensures photo's credibility; and 3) an A-tree shape data structure model for clustering streaming pictures to reduce information redundancy and provide maximum event coverage. Experiment results investigate the performances of the proposed recruitment approach and show that our algorithm outperforms two other benchmarking approaches. Also, we conduct simulations to evaluate the strategies of the proposed recruitment algorithm, given different fairness levels among events. Data quality simulation results show effectiveness in reducing false submissions and delivering high-quality responses. Finally, framework implementation for real-world applications is provided.","2329-924X","","10.1109/TCSS.2020.2967585","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8982179","Data quality;deep learning;event reporting;recruitment;spatial mobile crowdsourcing (SMCS)","Task analysis;Sensors;Crowdsourcing;Recruitment;Monitoring;Mobile handsets;Cameras","","37","","44","IEEE","4 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Recently, crowdsourcing has emerged as a promising solution for facilitating WiFi positioning. To crowdsense a radio map, traces collected from normal users are merged to recover the original walking paths. In this work, we design a robust iterative trace merging algorithm called WiFi-RITA based on WiFi access points as signal-marks. The algorithm formulates the trace merging problem as an optimization problem in which each trace is translated and rotated to minimize the limitation of distances among traces defined by WiFi access points. WiFi-RITA is further enhanced by removing outliers. WiFi-RITA is robust to the rotation errors of traces and efficient for a large number of short traces. According to the crowdsensed radio map, a sensor fusion approach based on particle filter by fusing inertial sensors and a multivariate Gaussian fingerprinting is proposed to enhance the accuracy of crowdsourcing indoor positioning. The experiment results in two large-scale environments demonstrate that WiFi-RITA positioning with zero-effort calibration achieves high positioning accuracy, which outperforms Pedestrian Dead Reckoning (PDR) and fingerprinting with K Nearest Neighbor.","1558-2248","","10.1109/TWC.2021.3053582","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61801189); Science and Technology Development Program of Jilin Province(grant numbers:20200201287JC); Beihang Zhuobai(grant numbers:ZG216S2019); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9340565","Indoor positioning;crowdsourcing;WiFi","Crowdsourcing;Wireless fidelity;Merging;Bluetooth;Wireless communication;Noise measurement;Legged locomotion","","37","","33","IEEE","29 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
