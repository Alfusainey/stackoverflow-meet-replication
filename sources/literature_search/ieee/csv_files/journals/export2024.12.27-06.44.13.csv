Lots of programming know-what and know-how knowledge is documented in text, for example, API reference documentation and programming tutorials. To improve knowledge accessibility and usage, several recent studies use Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods to construct API know-what knowledge graph (API-KG) and programming task know-how knowledge graph (Task-KG) from software documentation. Although being promising, current API-KG and Task-KG are independent of each other, and thus are void of inherent connections between the two types of knowledge. Our empirical study on Stack Overflow questions confirms that only 36% of the API usage problems can be answered by the know-how or the know-what knowledge alone, while the rest questions requires a fusion of both. Inspired by this observation, we make the first attempt to fuse API-KG and Task-KG by API entity linking. This fusion creates nine categories of API semantic relations and two types of task semantic relations which are not present in the stand-alone API-KG or Task-KG. According to the definitions of these new API and task semantic relations, our approach dives deeper than surface-level API linking of API-KG and Task-KG, and infer nine categories of API semantic relations from task descriptions and two types of task semantic relations with the assistance of API-KG, which enrich the declaration or syntactic relations in the current API-KG and Task-KG. Our fused and semantically-enriched API-Task KG supports coherent API/Task-centric knowledge search by text or code queries. We have implemented our approach on Java programming documentation and built a web tool to search and explore API and programming task knowledge. Our evaluation confirms the high-accuracy of our knowledge extraction, fusion and enrichment methods, and the effectiveness and usefulness of our API-Task KG for answering Stack Overflow questions.","1939-1374","","10.1109/TSC.2022.3207273","National Nature Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61902162,61862033,62262031); Nature Science Foundation of Jiangxi Province(grant numbers:20202BAB202015); Postgraduate Innovation Fund Project of Jiangxi Province(grant numbers:YC2021-S308); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9894095","Software programming;knowledge graph;knowledge fusion;semantic enrichment;knowledge search","Task analysis;Semantics;Programming;Java;Codes;Tutorials;Documentation","","5","","34","IEEE","16 Sep 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A learning-to-rank-based method is also proposed that incorporates a feature extracted from related CQA content. Our results show that even if a CQA answer does not contain a perfect answer to a query, their content can be exploited to improve the extraction of answer-biased summaries from other corpora. The quality of CQA content is found to impact on the accuracy of optimization-based summaries, though medium quality answers enable the system to achieve a comparable (and in some cases superior) accuracy to state-of-the-art techniques. The learning-to-rank-based summaries, on the other hand, are not significantly influenced by CQA quality.

This paper focuses on addressing the lexical gap problem in question retrieval. Question retrieval in cQA archives aims to find the existing questions that are semantically equivalent or relevant to the queried questions. However, the lexical gap problem brings a new challenge for question retrieval in cQA. In this paper, we propose to model and learn distributed word representations with metadata of category information within cQA pages for question retrieval using two novel category powered models. One is a basic category powered model called MB-NET and the other one is an enhanced category powered model called ME-NET which can better learn the distributed word representations and alleviate the lexical gap problem. To deal with the variable size of word representation vectors, we employ the framework of fisher kernel to transform them into the fixed-length vectors. Experimental results on large-scale English and Chinese cQA data sets show that our proposed approaches can significantly outperform state-of-the-art retrieval models for question retrieval in cQA. Moreover, we further conduct our approaches on large-scale automatic evaluation experiments.

In the social network, experts provide knowledgeable answers to the questions in their domain of expertise, while celebrities publish influential opinions toward the topics led by some questions. Given the large amount of knowledge organized in the format of question–answers, an interesting research problem is to recommend questions to users so as to maximize their engagements with the platform. However, recommending questions in CQA services is a non-trivial task. Data sources in the CQA services are of different types. It is challenging to incorporate heterogeneous information for the recommendation task. Furthermore, data sparsity is an inherent problem in such platforms. In this paper, we propose a model that is able to jointly model both implicit and explicit information for question recommendation. The model integrates multiple data sources and addresses the problem of data heterogeneity. In the proposed model, we dynamically discover latent user groups and incorporate those hierarchical information to bridge the semantic gaps among users in the shared latent space. We evaluate the proposed model on two real-world datasets, and demonstrate that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art alternatives by a large margin.

This paper proposes a novel application of text categorization for two types of microblogging questions asked in a classroom, namely relevant (i.e., questions that the teacher wants to address in the class) and irrelevant questions. Empirical results and analysis show that using personalization together with question text leads to better categorization accuracy than using question text alone. It is also beneficial to utilize the correlation between questions and available lecture materials as well as the correlation between questions asked in a lecture. Furthermore, empirical results also show that the elimination of stopwords leads to better correlation estimation between questions and leads to better categorization accuracy. On the other hand, incorporating students' votes on the questions does not improve categorization accuracy, although a similar feature has been shown to be effective in community question answering environments for assessing question quality.","1939-1382","","10.1109/TLT.2011.14","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5744069","Education;computer uses in education.","Electronic publishing;Support vector machines;Social network services;Blogs;Text categorization","","9","","33","IEEE","7 Apr 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Most of previous research on cQA has shown that questions can reflect two intents: learning information and starting a conversation. The purpose of this research is investigating the intrinsic relationship between models predicting question intent and user age. And if this relatedness can assist in overcoming one of the chief obstacles when constructing effective question intent recognizers: the scarcity of annotated data. The method adopted in this work involves addressing question intent recognition in a Multi-Task (MT) learning setting, where asker age identification is used as its auxiliary task. In other words, we exploit their task synergy by integrating both training signals with the aim of boosting the classification rate of question intent. Since MT learning is regarded as fruitful when a target task is improved wrt. single-task models, in our experiments, we compare four frontier frameworks with several state-of-the-art single-task neural network classifiers. In brief, our results show that a MT implementation of T5 yielded an increase of at least 10% over the best single-task models, when trained on full questions. Our experimental results also unveil that extra substantial improvements can be obtained by adjusting its parameters. All in all, we conclude that both variables are inherently related. Last but not least, we also make available a new question set labelled with the age of their askers and their intents with the hope of encouraging the research of MT learning into cQA tasks.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3322457","Chilean Government through the project FONDECYT “Multimodal Demographics and Psychographics for Improving Engagement in Question Answering Communities”(grant numbers:1220367); Patagón supercomputer of Universidad Austral de Chile(grant numbers:FONDEQUIP EQM180042); Center for Bioinformatics and Integrative Biology (CBIB), hosted at the Faculty of Biological Sciences, Universidad Andrés Bello, Santiago, Chile; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10273378","Multi-task learning;question analysis;question answering;shared transformers","Task analysis;Multitasking;Sentiment analysis;Training;Question answering (information retrieval);Metadata;Web search;Transformers","","1","","52","CCBYNCND","6 Oct 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Extending notions developed for statistical expert systems we present a prototype intelligent discovery assistant (IDA), which provides users with 1) systematic enumerations of valid DM processes, in order that important, potentially fruitful options are not overlooked, and 2) effective rankings of these valid processes by different criteria, to facilitate the choice of DM processes to execute. We use the prototype to show that an IDA can indeed provide useful enumerations and effective rankings in the context of simple classification processes. We discuss how an IDA could be an important tool for knowledge sharing among a team of data miners.

To address this issue, we propose a distilled Siamese tracking framework to learn small, fast and accurate trackers (students), which capture critical knowledge from large Siamese trackers (teachers) by a teacher-students knowledge distillation model. This model is intuitively inspired by the one teacher versus multiple students learning method typically employed in schools. In particular, our model contains a single teacher-student distillation module and a student-student knowledge sharing mechanism. The former is designed using a tracking-specific distillation strategy to transfer knowledge from a teacher to students. The latter is utilized for mutual learning between students to enable in-depth knowledge understanding. Extensive empirical evaluations on several popular Siamese trackers demonstrate the generality and effectiveness of our framework. Moreover, the results on five tracking benchmarks show that the proposed distilled trackers achieve compression rates of up to 18× and frame-rates of 265 FPS, while obtaining comparable tracking accuracy compared to base models.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2021.3127492","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62106128); Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province(grant numbers:ZR202102240155); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9612065","Siamese network;teacher-students;knowledge distillation;visual object tracking;siamese trackers","Training;Target tracking;Real-time systems;Visualization;Correlation;Knowledge engineering;Feature extraction","Humans;Algorithms;Learning","102","","86","IEEE","11 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, the conventional CNN-based methods are lack of generality capabilities under time-varying signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions, because these methods are merely trained on specific datasets and can only work under the corresponding condition. In this paper, a novel multi-task learning (MTL)-based generalized AMC method is proposed, and a more realistic scenario is considered, including white non-Gaussian noise and synchronization error. Its generalization capability stems from knowledge-sharing-based MTL in varying noise scenarios. In detail, multiple CNN models with the same structure are trained for multiple SNR conditions, but they share their knowledge (e.g. model weight) with each other. Thus, MTL can extract the general features from datasets in different noise scenarios.

Generally, a specially designed projection and reconstruction transfer functions bridging multiple domains for heterogeneous knowledge sharing are wanted. However, we argue that the existing subspace reconstruction based domain adaptation algorithms neglect the class prior, such that the learned transfer function is biased, especially when data scarcity of some class is encountered. Different from those previous methods, in this article, we propose a novel class-wise reconstruction-based adaptation method called Class-specific Reconstruction Transfer Learning (CRTL), which optimizes a well modeled transfer loss function by fully exploiting intra-class dependency and inter-class independency. The merits of the CRTL are three-fold. 1) Using a class-specific reconstruction matrix to align the source domain with the target domain fully exploits the class prior in modeling the domain distribution consistency, which benefits the cross-domain classification. 2) Furthermore, to keep the intrinsic relationship between data and labels after feature augmentation, a projected Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (pHSIC), that measures the dependency between data and label, is first proposed in transfer learning community by mapping the data from raw space to RKHS. 3) In addition, by imposing low-rank and sparse constraints on the class-specific reconstruction coefficient matrix, the global and local data structure that contributes to domain correlation can be effectively preserved. Extensive experiments on challenging benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over state-of-the-art representation-based domain adaptation methods.

First, we build a permissioned edge blockchain to secure the peer-to-peer (P2P) energy and knowledge sharing in our framework. To maximize edge intelligence efficiency, we then investigate the wirelessly powered multiagent edge learning model and design the optimal edge learning strategy. Moreover, by constructing a two-stage Stackelberg game, the underlying energy-knowledge trading incentive mechanisms are also proposed with the optimal economic incentives and power transmission strategies. Finally, simulation results show that our incentive strategies could optimize the utilities of both parties compared with classic schemes, and our optimal learning design could realize the optimal learning efficiency.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2020.3024246","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61831007,61972255); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9197687","Edge intelligence;game theory;incentive mechanism;permissioned blockchain;wireless power transfer (WPT)","Batteries;Artificial intelligence;Smart devices;Internet of Things;Wireless power transfer;Performance evaluation","","76","","43","IEEE","15 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Individuals’ physical and physiological status can be constantly monitored, and numerous data can be collected through wearable and mobile devices. However, the silo of individual data brings limitations to existing machine learning approaches to correctly identify a user’s health status. Distributed machine learning paradigms, such as federated learning, offer a potential solution for privacy-preserving knowledge sharing without sending raw personal data. However, federated learning is vulnerable to harmful participants that can degrade the overall model quality by sharing low-quality data. Therefore, it is critical to select suitable participants to ensure the accuracy and efficiency of federated learning. In this article, a unique clustering-based approach is proposed to use social context data for participant selection. Different edge participant groups will be established, and group-specific federated learning will be performed. The models of various edge groups will be further aggregated to strengthen the robustness of the global model. The experimental results demonstrated that through participant selection, clustering-based hierarchical federated learning can achieve better results with less participants in two different IoMT applications for ECG and human motion monitoring. This shows the efficacy of the proposed method in improving federated learning performance and efficiency in various IoMT applications.","2329-924X","","10.1109/TCSS.2023.3259431","QuakeCoRE, a New Zealand Tertiary Education Commission-funded center(grant numbers:0834); Hunan Provincial Innovation Foundation For Postgraduate(grant numbers:CX20211102); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10091843","Clustering;federated learning;Internet of Medical Things (IoMT);participant selection","Federated learning;Data models;Computational modeling;Biomedical monitoring;Distributed databases;Context modeling;Monitoring","","68","","39","IEEE","4 Apr 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This has lead to a need for studies focused on the barriers to the adoption and assimilation of complex technologies. This research synthesizes the economic and organizational learning perspectives of technology adoption and identifies key adoption barriers, mechanism to reduce these barriers, and proposes a research model that interrelate these factors to the assimilation of complex technologies. The research context for this paper is the assimilation of one complex technology, namely, component-based software development (CBD) by information systems (IS) departments. Data collected from IS units in the United States is used to test the model using partial least square analysis. The results provide evidence that organizations better positioned to overcome knowledge barriers because of their knowledge stocks are likely to be further along in the assimilation process than others and that knowledge sharing by technology vendors positively influences technology assimilation by reducing the learning burden of the adopters. It was also found that exposure to signals from technology vendors reduced the technology uncertainty perceived by the adopters.","1558-0040","","10.1109/TEM.2005.844925","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1424414","Innovation adoption;IS management;knowledge barriers;software development;technology management;technology uncertainty","Object oriented programming;Management information systems;Least squares methods;Software development management","","62","","23","IEEE","25 Apr 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Such networks provide the possibility to interconnect mobile devices to achieve fast knowledge sharing for efficient collaborative learning and operations, especially with the help of distributed machine learning, e.g., Federated Learning (FL), and modern digital technologies, e.g., Digital Twin (DT) systems. Typically, FL requires a fixed group of participants that have Independent and Identically Distributed (IID) data for accurate and stable model training, which is highly unlikely in real-world mobile network scenarios. In this paper, in order to facilitate the lightweight model training and real-time processing in high-speed mobile networks, we design and introduce an end-edge-cloud structured three-layer Federated Reinforcement Learning (FRL) framework, incorporated with an edge-cloud structured DT system. A dual-Reinforcement Learning (dual-RL) scheme is devised to support optimizations of client node selection and global aggregation frequency during FL via a cooperative decision-making strategy, which is assisted by a two-layer DT system deployed in the edge-cloud for real-time monitoring of mobile devices and environment changes. A model pruning and federated bidirectional distillation (Bi-distillation) mechanism is then developed locally for the lightweight model training, while a model splitting scheme with a lightweight data augmentation mechanism is developed globally to separately optimize the aggregation weights based on a splitted neural network structure (i.e., the encoder and classifier) in a more targeted manner, which can work together to effectively reduce the overall communication cost and improve the non-IID problem. Experiment and evaluation results compared with three baseline methods using two different real-world datasets demonstrate the usefulness and outstanding performance of our proposed FRL model in communication-efficient model training and non-IID issue alleviation for high-speed mobile network scenarios.","1558-0008","","10.1109/JSAC.2023.3310046","Grantsin-Aid for Scientific Research (C) from the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS)(grant numbers:23K11064); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62072171,72091515); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10269106","Federated learning;reinforcement learning;digital twin;knowledge distillation;lightweight training;mobile networks","Training;Data models;Real-time systems;Reinforcement learning;Knowledge engineering;Semantics;Mobile handsets","","59","","33","IEEE","3 Oct 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

As a consequence, there has been an increasing interest in exploring knowledge sharing among a large number of languages so that a universal set of acoustic phone units can be defined to work for multiple or even for all languages. This work aims at demonstrating that a recently proposed automatic speech attribute transcription framework can play a key role in designing language-universal acoustic models by sharing speech units among all target languages at the acoustic phonetic attribute level. The language-universal acoustic models are evaluated through phone recognition. It will be shown that good cross-language attribute detection and continuous phone recognition performance can be accomplished for “unseen” languages using minimal training data from the target languages to be recognized.

This paper focuses on one potentially important determinant of IT investment outcomes-integration of business and IT planning. Integration is examined using three kinds of participation: business managers' participation in IT planning, IT managers' participation in business planning, and top managers' participation in IT resource allocation. Based on considerations of knowledge sharing and commitment, a theoretical model linking these three aspects to three potential consequences-quality of IT plans, IT project problems, and IT-based organization performance-and two antecedents-top managers' perception of IT importance and environmental heterogeneity-is developed. The model is tested using data collected through a survey of 274 chief information officer (CIO) respondents. Results of structural equation modeling analysis support 12 of the 15 hypotheses. Surprisingly, top managers' participation in resource allocation had a stronger association with IT-based organizational performance than either quality of IT plans or the absence of IT project problems. This implies that the role of IT planning and alignment might be weakened when investments reflect top managements' selection. Implications of the study for practice and future research are examined.","1558-0040","","10.1109/TEM.2007.906848","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4344959","Environmental uncertainty;information systems planning;knowledge integration;project management;structural equation modeling","Information systems;Project management;Organizational aspects;Resource allocation","","50","","114","IEEE","29 Oct 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To date, Many approaches have been proposed to facilitate the rumor detection process by utilizing the multi-task learning mechanism, which aims to improve the performance of rumor detection task by leveraging the useful information in the stance detection task. However, most of the existing approaches suffer from three limitations: (1) only focus on the textual content and ignore the multi-modal information which is key component contained in social media data; (2) ignore the difference of feature space between the stance detection task and rumor detection task, resulting in the unsatisfactory usage of stance information; (3) largely neglect the semantic information hidden in the fine-grained stance labels. Therefore, in this paper, we design a Multi-modal Meta Multi-Task Learning (MM-MTL) framework for social media rumor detection. To make use of multiple modalities, we design a multi-modal post embedding layer which considers both textual and visual content. To overcome the feature-sharing problem of the stance detection task and rumor detection task, we propose a meta knowledge-sharing scheme to share some higher meta network-layers and capture the meta knowledge behind the multi-modal post. To better utilize the semantic information hidden in the fine-grained stance labels, we employ the attention mechanism to estimate the weight of each reply.

For many years, farmers have identified various crop diseases and have local knowledge about disease management. However, the local knowledge of one agricultural region is not utilized in other regions due to the unavailability of knowledge sharing platforms. Agricultural research also suggests that crop production has mainly decreased due to diseases, methods of cultivation, irrigation, and lack of local agricultural knowledge. In this research, the experience of agricultural experts, farmers, and cultivators is gathered through a crowd-sourced platform. The data is then processed for various disease identification. Hence, timely identification of various crop diseases can benefit farmers to apply relevant management methods. In literature, researchers have proposed various methods for disease management, mostly based on the classification of crop diseases using Machine Learning (ML) algorithms. However, these algorithms are unable to give trustful results due to static data provisioning and the dynamic nature of various diseases in different agricultural regions. Further, the agricultural expert's experience is also not considered in verifying the classification results. To identify the dynamic nature of wheat diseases, we acquired high-quality images and symptoms-based text data from farmers, domain experts, and users using a crowd-sourced platform. Different augmentation techniques were also used to enhance the size of training data. In this paper, a modern generic approach has been proposed for the identification and classification of wheat diseases using Decision Trees (DT) and different deep learning models. Also, results of both algorithms were then verified by domain experts that improved the decision trees accuracy by 28.5%, CNN accuracy by 4.3% (leading to 97.2%), and resulted in decision rules for wheat diseases in a knowledge-based system.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3058582","Cluster of Innovations in Computers Science (CICS), SSUET; Smart VideoSurveillance Laboratory, an affiliated laboratory of the HEC- National Center in Big Data and Cloud Computing (NCBC), FAST-NUCES, Karachi; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9351910","Agricultural DSS;artificial intelligence;agricultural knowledge management;classification of crop diseases;machine learning;wheat crop diseases","Diseases;Agriculture;Insects;Production;Machine learning algorithms;Knowledge based systems;Genetics","","38","","56","CCBYNCND","10 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Following a hierarchical graph model for enhanced collaborative learning within a task-oriented learning process, which describes relations of learning actions, activities, sub-tasks and tasks in communities, the learning action pattern and Goal-driven Learning Group, as well as their formal definitions and related algorithms, are introduced to extract and analyze users' learning behaviors in both personal and cooperative ways.

The purpose of this paper is to offer a standardization model of interprocess communication that increases manufacturing operational performance (MOP). First, we propose a novel holistic model that makes standardized interprocess communication possible in manufacturing organizations.

It is, nevertheless, paradoxical that although the medical community has embraced with satisfaction most of the technological discoveries allowing the improvement in patient care, this has not happened when talking about health-care informatics. Taking the above issue of concern, our work proposes an information model for knowledge management (KM) based upon the use of key performance indicators (KPIs) in health-care systems. Based upon the use of the balanced scorecard (BSC) framework (Kaplan/Norton) and quality assurance techniques in health care (Donabedian), this paper is proposing a patient journey centered approach that drives information flow at all levels of the day-to-day process of delivering effective and managed care, toward information assessment and knowledge discovery. In order to persuade health-care decision-makers to assess the added value of KM tools, those should be used to propose new performance measurement and performance management techniques at all levels of a health-care system. The proposed KPIs are forming a complete set of metrics that enable the performance management of a regional health-care system. In addition, the performance framework established is technically applied by the use of state-of-the-art KM tools such as data warehouses and business intelligence information systems. In that sense, the proposed infrastructure is, technologically speaking, an important KM tool that enables knowledge sharing amongst various health-care stakeholders and between different health-care groups. The use of BSC is an enabling framework toward a KM strategy in health care.","1558-0032","","10.1109/TITB.2005.847196","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1435416","Balanced scorecard (BSC);business intelligence;health-care system performance management;key performance indicators (KPIs);knowledge management (KM);regional health-care authority","Knowledge management;Medical services;Communications technology;Biomedical informatics;Quality assurance;Drives;Information management;Quality management;Measurement;Data warehouses","Greece;Information Management;Quality Indicators, Health Care;Regional Health Planning","30","","22","IEEE","13 Jun 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We ablate Federated Learning (FL) successful features as a basis to ensure high precision of learning inferences at timescales relevant to the underlying time-varying space network and channel dynamics. In such a dynamic setting, there is always a likelihood that miners may be compromised or fail to propagate information in time because of some intrinsic factors such as channel impairments, satellite handovers and attacks. Such transmission failures often lead to undesirable forking events in the Blockchain. Consequently, maintaining a low energy consumption and smallish delay in such an erratic network is highly nontrivial and challenging. To quantify the impacts of the forking and minimize the occurrence of such unwanted events and their adverse effects, we develop a procedure to estimate the expected energy consumption for a given set of miners, block transmissions, and LEOs’ or UAVs’ mobility.

Some of these risks are specific to GSD, while others also appear in co-localized environments but are aggravated in GSD. A systematic literature review (SLR) has been conducted to identify the risks to RE that occur in GSD, along with the safeguards with which to manage these risks. Inspired by a grounded theory approach, risks and safeguards have been elicited and grouped by means of collaborative tagging and cluster analysis techniques, and then bivariate correlation tests have been applied to measure the association between these risks and safeguards. The results of the SLR include the identification of a great variety of risks to RE in GSD (218), along with a large number of safeguards (146 in total). Starting from these results, a risks and safeguards repository that encompasses the entire state of the art on RE in GSD has been produced and is now publicly available. This repository can be used as a growing knowledge base by any organization interested in carrying out RE in GSD. The objective is to assist those organizations that are inexperienced in GSD to handle the problems that may arise when involved in a global development. The most common risks identified in the literature are related to: 1) knowledge sharing; 2) client and vendor relationships; 3) problems with process definition; and 4) communication problems. It was also found that in the literature, the risks related to management and project coordination, knowledge management and awareness, socio-cultural differences, and client-vendor distance are the ones most lacking in proposed safeguards; these are therefore concerns to which more attention should be paid.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2874096","Ministerio de Economía y Competitividad(grant numbers:TIN2015-70259-C2-2-R); European Regional Development Fund(grant numbers:TIN2015-70259-C2-2-R); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8482263","Global software development;quantitative analysis;requirements engineering;risks and safeguards;systematic literature review","Software;Bibliographies;Organizations;Systematics;Collaboration;Requirements engineering;Encoding","","29","","146","OAPA","5 Oct 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To overcome such challenges, the conceptual design phase has been adapted to the current model development process. For that, the system engineers start to define the most relevant system architecture by respecting quality and time constraints. Next, the simulation model architects design the delivered system architecture in a more formal way with a modeling and simulation point of view to support the integration of domain-level simulation models in a consistent fashion. Finally, the model architects negotiate with different simulation model providers with the aim of specifying vehicle- and domain-level simulation models and their interface connections. To improve knowledge sharing between the mentioned actors, we propose a model identity card (MIC) for classifying simulation model knowledge, including input/output parameters, method, and usage specifications. The fundamental concepts that form the basis of all simulation models are identified and typed for implementation into a computational environment. An industrial case study of the engine-after-treatment model is used to show how MICs and the integrated model design phase might be used in a given scenario.

Through the coordinated bidirectional communication network of the SDA, the remote human operator has improved visibility and understanding of the mission profile. We evaluate our SSOSA in an asset inspection mission within a confined operating environment. Demonstrating the ability of our SSOSA to overcome safety, reliability and resilience challenges. The SDA supports lifecycle learning and co-evolution with knowledge sharing across the interconnected systems. Our results evaluate both sudden and gradual faults, as well as unknown events, that may jeopardize an autonomous mission. Using distributed and coordinated decision making, the SSOSA enhances the analysis of the mission status, which includes diagnostics of critical sub-systems within the resident robot.

We propose cooperative learning theory as a lens to understand knowledge integration activities in ISD projects. We suggest that knowledge integration behaviors are discretionary, and that ISD professionals must feel autonomy in deciding to engage in them. We investigate whether the effects of autonomy on cooperative learning and of cooperative learning on work outcomes vary depending on the types of autonomy present in ISD teams. A research model is proposed, and it is empirically tested through a study of 206 ISD professionals from 38 ISD teams. Our findings suggest that autonomous teams engage more frequently in cooperative learning behaviors, and consequently perform more effectively and are more satisfied.

To resolve this challenge various big data and natural language processing techniques were applied. Another widely used approach to resolve the challenges of heterogeneity, interoperability, and complexity of integrated domain is ontology-based semantic modeling. We proposed Ontology for River Flow and Flood Mitigation (ORFFM) for semantic knowledge formalization with semantic understandability of irrigation, disaster management, related administrative and agricultural domain concepts by humans and machines. The semantic modeling of distributed river flow network and associated flood disaster mitigation for effective coordination, collaborative response activities leads to reduce the impact of a disaster and improve information representation among stakeholders. Furthermore, semantic formalization and inference are supported by explicitly annotated information. We populated ORFFM with Pakistan's Indus river system, flood disaster management, and Sindh administrative authorities to develop a knowledgebase for knowledge sharing and representation. The formal semantically enriched knowledgebase would contribute towards streamflow optimization and flood mitigation through effective coordination and common conceptualization during disaster management phases.

Measuring the utility of resources with precision becomes tricky in a dynamic post disaster scenario, where demands are constantly evolving and supplies trickle in at an uncertain rate. Moreover, collection and transmission of resource needs of far-flung areas are easier said than done owing to the post disaster disruption of communication infrastructure. These result in the ad-hoc allocation of emergency resources to the shelters. In this paper, we first derive a utility function for dynamically enumerating the shelter specific utility of each emergency resource. Subsequently, we propose an opportunistic knowledge sharing scheme for gathering and disseminating resource needs to the control station using a smartphone-based delay tolerant network. Finally, based on these opportunistically transmitted needs, we formulate a utility driven optimal resource allocation model which minimizes overall resource deficit and total resource deployment time. The proposed system optimally assigns constrained emergency resources to different shelters, so that high-utility resources are deployed fast. The effectiveness of the proposed system is evaluated using ONE simulator and LINGO optimization modeling tool. Exhaustive simulation is done to evaluate the comparative performance of our system with a number of competing schemes. Results show that our system outperforms all these schemes in a fully connected scenario.

Many international bodies have developed metamodels for IoT-enabled ecosystems to allow knowledge sharing. However, these are often narrow in focus and deal with only the IoT aspects without taking into account the management and analytics of big data generated by the IoT devices. Hence, in this article we propose a metamodel for the Integrated Big Data Management and Analytics (IBDMA) framework for IoT-enabled smart buildings. The IBDMA Metamodel can be used to facilitate interoperability between existing big data management and analytics ecosystems deployed in smart buildings or other smart environments. We import the metamodel into a knowledge graph management tool and by considering a case study we validate the metamodel using this tool.

The digital twin is characterized by a profound integration of physics and information systems, which provides a technical means for integrating multisource information and breaking the time and space barrier of communication at each link of the lifecycle. Currently, however, the application of this technology focuses primarily on the product itself and “service-oriented” application results. There is a lack of focus on twin data and its internal evolutionary mechanisms separately. In the management of global data resources, the benefits of digital twin technology cannot be fully realized. This article applies ontology technology in an innovative manner to the field of the digital twin to increase the reusability of twin data. Initially, a four-layered ontology-based twin data management architecture is presented. Then, a three-dimensional and three-granularity unified evolution model of full lifecycle twin data is proposed, as well as its ontology model. Then, the service mode of data components at each stage of the lifecycle is defined, a knowledge-sharing plane is established in the digital twin, and a data governance method based on ontology reasoning using data components on the shared plane is proposed. The ICandyBox simulation platform is then used to demonstrate the concept of the proposed method, and future research directions are proposed.","1941-0050","","10.1109/TII.2022.3187715","Key Areas Research and Development Program of Guangdong Province, China(grant numbers:2019B010150002); Open Fund of the Aerospace Servo Drive and Transmission Technology Laboratory(grant numbers:LASAT-2021-01); Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province(grant numbers:2021A1515011946); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9813407","Digital twin;metamodel;ontology reasoning;product lifecycle management (PLM);unified data modeling","Data models;Digital twins;Ontologies;Informatics;Solid modeling;Predictive models;Metadata","","17","","28","IEEE","1 Jul 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The types of information are diversified and abundant in recommendation systems; therefore the proportion of unstructured multimodal data such as text, image, and video is increasing. However, due to the representation gap between different modalities, it is intractable to effectively use unstructured multimodal data to improve the efficiency of recommendation systems. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end multimodal interest-related item similarity model (multimodal IRIS) to provide recommendations based on the multimodal data source. Specifically, the multimodal IRIS model consists of three modules, i.e., multimodal feature learning module, the interest-related network (IRN) module, and item similarity recommendation module. The multimodal feature learning module adds knowledge sharing unit among different modalities. Then, IRN learns the interest relevance between target item and different historical items respectively. Finally, the multimodal feature learning, IRN, and item similarity recommendation modules are unified into an integrated system to achieve performance enhancements and to accommodate the addition or absence of different modal data. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show that, by dealing with the multimodal data which people may pay more attention to when selecting items, the proposed multimodal IRIS significantly improves accuracy and interpretability on top-N recommendation task over the state-of-the-art methods.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2893355","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61772387,61802296); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:JB180101); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(grant numbers:2017M620438); Fundamental Research Funds of Ministry of Education and China Mobile(grant numbers:MCM20170202); ISN State Key Laboratory; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8618448","Top-N recommendation;multimodal data;multimodal interest-related item similarity;knowledge sharing unit","Visualization;Task analysis;Motion pictures;Deep learning;Feature extraction;Data models;Iris recognition","","17","","45","OAPA","18 Jan 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Targeting the CBL reconstruction of residential prosumers, a regression-based estimation scheme is proposed using stacked autoencoders (SAEs) under the federated learning (FL) framework. In the FL framework, each residential unit (RU) stores and trains data locally without sharing them with neighboring RUs or the independent third party (ITP) responsible for CBL reconstruction. Local updates containing no load information are exchanged with the ITP (server) for the training improvement. The FL framework can, thus, protect the privacy of customers. Experimental results show that the proposed FL-based cascaded SAE outperforms the baseline on all tests and achieves up to 62.5% improvement in reducing reconstruction error.

Our results reveal that competitor intelligence has a positive and direct effect on product innovation and relationships can be further strengthened by interfunctional coordination and open-mindedness. In testing their interaction with dynamic external environments, we found that the level of environmental uncertainty interacts positively with open-mindedness, but negatively with the effect of interfunctional coordination on product innovation.

We also improve SocialQ&A with security and efficiency enhancements by protecting user privacy and identifies, and retrieving answers automatically for recurrent questions. We describe the architecture and algorithms, and conducted comprehensive large-scale simulation to evaluate SocialQ&A in comparison with other methods.

EMT can solve multiple related optimization tasks simultaneously and enhance the optimization of each task via knowledge sharing among tasks. Many EMT algorithms have been proposed and achieved success in various problems, yet EMT for multiobjective optimization remains a big challenge. The existing multiobjective EMT algorithms tend to suffer from slow convergence and difficulty in generating high-quality knowledge. To alleviate these issues, this article proposes a new EMT algorithm, namely, EMT-GS for multiobjective optimization based on two generative strategies. Particularly, generative adversarial networks (GANs) and inertial differential evolution (IDE) are introduced to generate transferable knowledge and offspring, respectively. A GAN is trained periodically for each source-target task pair, based on which helpful knowledge is generated from the source task and transferred to boost the solving of the target task. To accelerate the population convergence, the IDE strategy is put forward to generate offspring in a promising direction according to the individuals from the previous generation and the transferred knowledge. The performance of EMT-GS is validated on three multitasking multiobjective benchmark problems. The experimental results highlight the excellent competitiveness of EMT-GS compared to other state-of-the-art multiobjective EMT algorithms.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2022.3189029","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2021YFB2900800); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61871272); National Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong, China(grant numbers:2020A1515010479,2021A1515011911); Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory(grant numbers:2020B121201001); Shenzhen Fundamental Research Program(grant numbers:20200811181752003,JCYJ20190808173617147); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9817402","Differential evolution (DE);evolutionary multitasking (EMT);generative adversarial networks (GANs);multiobjective optimization","Task analysis;Optimization;Statistics;Sociology;Multitasking;Knowledge transfer;Knowledge engineering","","13","","50","IEEE","7 Jul 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Inquiry in numerous design disciplines indicates that practitioners approach complex situations in ways that are fundamentally different from those of researchers. In this work, I take a practice-led approach to understanding visualization design practice on its own terms. Twenty data visualization practitioners were interviewed and asked about their design process, including the steps they take, how they make decisions, and the methods they use. Findings suggest that practitioners do not follow highly systematic processes, but instead rely on situated forms of knowing and acting in which they draw from precedent and use methods and principles that are determined appropriate in the moment.

Being a virtual interaction space in which members are not formally bound to stay, the extent to which members have a sense of social identity, or perceiving themselves as a part of the VC, may be a key to determine their continuance intention in the VC. However, it is important to recognize that social identity is neither a unidimensional concept nor are VCs universal in nature. In this study, we examine two variants of VCs, one focusing on knowledge sharing and another on support/advocacy, and show that different dimensions of social identity matters for the two VCs. In particular, members' sense of cognitive social identity promotes their continuance intention in knowledge-based VCs, whereas it is the emotional social identity that works in support/advocacy VCs. Furthermore, the cultivation of the two dimensions of social identity requires the facilitation of different VC artifacts. Overall, our findings offer a more nuanced understanding of the role of social identity in promoting members' continuance in VCs, and underscore that a naive universal approach of cultivating social identity without considering VC type is not enough; rather, a VC-dependent strategy with differential emphasis on developing different VC artifacts could be more fruitful.","1558-0040","","10.1109/TEM.2015.2488698","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:71472083,71522006); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7312948","Continuance;information technology (IT) artifacts;knowledge sharing;social identity;support/advocacy;virtual community (VC);Continuance;information technology (IT) artifacts;knowledge sharing;social identity;support/advocacy;virtual community (VC)","Knowledge based systems;Context;Virtual environments;Ports (Computers);Instruments;Buildings;Bonding","","12","","14","IEEE","30 Oct 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Significant variances caused by different participants or diverse sensor devices limit the direct application of a pre-trained model to a subject or device that has not been seen before. To address these problems, we present an invariant feature learning framework (IFLF) that extracts common information shared across subjects and devices. IFLF incorporates two learning paradigms: 1) meta-learning to capture robust features across seen domains and adapt to an unseen one with similarity-based data selection; 2) multi-task learning to deal with data shortage and enhance overall performance via knowledge sharing among different subjects. Experiments demonstrated that IFLF is effective in handling both subject and device diversion across popular open datasets and an in-house dataset.

Temporal patterns in social media networks are modeled based on the nodal attributes of individuals and the time information of network ties. Using social media data collected from a knowledge sharing community, empirical tests were conducted to evaluate the performance of the NATERGM on identifying the temporal patterns and predicting the characteristics of the future networks. Results showed that the NATERGM demonstrated an enhanced pattern testing capability and an increased prediction accuracy of network characteristics compared to benchmark models. The proposed NATERGM model helps explain the roles of nodal attributes in the formation process of dynamic networks.","1558-2191","","10.1109/TKDE.2015.2493549","National Science Foundation(grant numbers:CMMI-1442116,CMMI-1249210); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7303952","Social networking;graphs and networks;web mining;knowledge sharing;Social networking;graphs and networks;web mining;knowledge sharing","Media;Hidden Markov models;Analytical models;Predictive models;Social network services;Testing;Bridges","","11","","55","IEEE","26 Oct 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The advantages of our model include combined use of semantic and taxonomic sources of information for clustering, one step/simultaneous training, which enables knowledge sharing between the two information sources and reduces hyperparameters, and no dependence on third-party data.

However, in reality, data usually reside in distributed parties such as different institutions and may not be directly gathered and integrated due to various data policy constraints. As a result, some parties may suffer from insufficient data available for training machine learning models. In this article, we propose a multiparty dual learning (MPDL) framework to alleviate the problem of limited data with poor quality in an isolated party. Since the knowledge-sharing processes for multiple parties always emerge in dual forms, we show that dual learning is naturally suitable to handle the challenge of missing data, and explicitly exploits the probabilistic correlation and structural relationship between dual tasks to regularize the training process. We introduce a feature-oriented differential privacy with mathematical proof, in order to avoid possible privacy leakage of raw features in the dual inference process. The approach requires minimal modifications to the existing multiparty learning structure, and each party can build flexible and powerful models separately, whose accuracy is no less than nondistributed self-learning approaches. The MPDL framework achieves significant improvement compared with state-of-the-art multiparty learning methods, as we demonstrated through simulations on real-world datasets.","2168-2275","","10.1109/TCYB.2021.3139076","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62036006); Australian Research Council (ARC)(grant numbers:LP180100114,DP200102611); A*STAR Centre for Frontier AI Research (CFAR) and the Data Science Artificial Intelligence Research Center (DSAIR) at School of Computer Science and Engineering, Nanyang Technological University; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9686623","Dual learning;multiparty learning;privacy preservation","Data models;Task analysis;Distributed databases;Privacy;Training;Probabilistic logic;Differential privacy","","10","","49","IEEE","19 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The semantic web has rapidly spread, appearing as a new challenge for knowledge sharing and automatic processing. However, the reality is that the power of the semantic web is still barely used. This is mostly because of the fact that the semantic web is a powerful but complex technology that most end users cannot afford to use for their common problem-solving activities. This has probably made the semantic web to stay in the background of interactive technologies, unlike other new end-user-oriented paradigms (e.g., the so-called Web 2.0 and later approaches) that have very much increased along these years. Nevertheless, the semantic web can be considered as a highly valuable paradigm that has not been, conveniently, exploited yet. In this paper, we propose a semantic environment to exploit semantic interaction by end users in order to help them access semantic information easily. We follow a programming by demonstration approach, where the user navigates and modifies HTML presentation of data and the system, automatically, infers changes to the underlying semantic models. Furthermore, we provide an evaluation of the interaction, including the most important results obtained for the proposed approach.","1558-2442","","10.1109/TSMCC.2012.2187052","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6168852","Human–computer interaction (HCI);semantic web;user-centered design;user interfaces","Semantics;Ontologies;Semantic Web;HTML;Web pages;User interfaces","","10","","36","IEEE","13 Mar 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Nevertheless, the precise spectrum prediction is challenging due to the interference from both intra-spectrum and external factors. To tackle these complex internal and external correlations, we develop a model named TF$^2$2AN, consisting of three components: 1) a robust signal detection algorithm based on image processing, 2) an attention-based Long Short-term Memory network to capture the temporal-frequency correlations, 3) a generalized fusion module to take the heterogeneous external factors into account. This structure shows prominent effectiveness for spectrum prediction on a single monitoring station with sufficient data. However, when the data derived from a single station is insufficient, the performance of the deep learning model will decline a lot. Considering that more than one monitoring station is deployed in practice, the new challenge becomes how to enhance our model by leveraging the data from multiple stations or frequency bands. Therefore, we further propose T-TF$^2$2AN, a transfer learning-based framework for data augmentation and knowledge sharing in spectrum prediction.

Existing microscopic fuel consumption models are mostly steady state models with limited vehicle parameters as dynamic variables. Data-driven solutions can make the model comprehensive by introducing broad impact factors. However, without the required accessible online computational capability and fast model adaptation mechanisms, those data-driven solutions cannot quickly adapt to unseen driving conditions and engine condition changes based on real-world vehicle data to support MB-VPC. In this paper, a connected vehicle-based data mining (CV-DM) framework is proposed to achieve online adaptive dynamic fuel consumption modeling through knowledge sharing over CVs and the CV remote data center. Based on the CV-DM framework, CV-supported Distributed Meta-regression (CV-DMR) algorithms are developed to realize a fast few-shot adaptation with limited training data. Extensive proof-of-concept experiments are conducted with steady-state and transient vehicle engine data. Compared to the baseline physical model and the existing non-adaptive grey-box model, prediction accuracy is improved by 47%-85% and 38%-80% respectively with only limited training data needed for the subject vehicle. Accordingly, a fuel savings of up to 9.4% can be achieved owing to the improvement of prediction accuracy.","1939-9359","","10.1109/TVT.2020.3002491","National Science Foundation(grant numbers:CNS-0644056); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9117148","Adaptive fuel consumption modeling;connected vehicles;data mining;distributed meta-learning","Adaptation models;Fuels;Data models;Computational modeling;Vehicle dynamics;Engines;Connected vehicles","","10","","73","IEEE","15 Jun 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Managing knowledge in the IWs domain is complex; however, promoting knowledge sharing based on standards and common terms agreeable to all players is essential and is something that must be established. In this context, ontologies, as a conceptual tool and a key component of knowledge-based systems, have been used by organizations for effective knowledge management, better decision-making, and interoperability among diverse institutions of an IWs domain. The development of ontology involves structural and logical complexity, and requires a well-designed, mature, and widely accepted methodology, to ensure its reliability. Many methodologies for ontology development have been proposed by several researchers; however, most of the developed methodologies have not included several important phases. Furthermore, several methodologies have not provided the complete details of the techniques and activities involved in the ontology construction process. Fewer details make it difficult to follow a methodology for designing ontologies. This study aims to compare existing methodologies based on sixteen important criteria and proposes an improved methodology for ontology development for IWs domains. The proposed methodology has included several important phases such as the Estimation of Human Resources, Re-engineering and Re-using of Resources, Collaborative Ontology Construction, the Conceptualization of both Endurants and Perdurants, Localization of an Ontology, Ontology Integration and Merging, Support for Interoperability, Versioning of an Ontology, and Ontology Population. The proposed methodology has been applied to design an OntoWM domain ontology for the Waste Management (WM) domain. The evaluation of the proposed methodology has been made by utilizing the designed OntoWM domain ontology in an ontology-based web application called SmartBinAnalytics. SmartBinAnalytics has been built using OntoWM, Java Server Pages (JSP), Jena Application Programming Interface (API), and MySQL.

Although various database forensic methods such as log analysis and investigation model development have been studied, among the database forensic methods, recovering deleted data is a key technique in database investigation for DB tampering and anti-forensics. Previous studies mainly focused on transaction or journal log to recover deleted data, but if logs are set to be deleted periodically or logs containing critical evidence are overwritten by new logs, the log-based recovery method can not be used practically. For this reason, an engine-based recovery method that analyzes data file at a raw level has been also introduced. There is research to recover small-sized databases such as SQLite and EDB, but there is no prior work describing the structure of data file and technology to recover deleted data of large databases used by enterprises or large organizations. In this context, we investigate Microsoft SQL Server (MSSQL), which is one of the most used large databases. Our method focuses on a storage engine of MSSQL. Through analyzing the storage engine, we identify the internal structure of MSSQL data files and the storage mechanism. Based on these findings, a method to recover tables and records is presented by empirical examination. It is compatible with various versions of MSSQL because it accesses data at the raw level. Our proposed method is verified by a comparative experiment with forensic tools implemented to recover deleted MSSQL data. The experimental results show that our method recovers all deleted records from the unallocated area. It recovers all data types including multimedia data, called Large Objects (LOB) in the database field.

The results show that the consequences of a comprehensive game of community members are determined by the location of the saddle point, which will evolve to the evolutionary stable strategy. The closer the position of the saddle point is to the origin, the greater the probability that the community members will select the collaboration strategy. The probability of one member selecting a collaboration strategy will have an impact on the probability of another member selecting a collaboration strategy.

Research question: What effects do virtual customer communities have on the relationship between absorptive capacity and organizational innovation? Literature review: Research has shown that virtual customer communities promote knowledge creation and knowledge sharing by facilitating communication within a virtual customer community. We investigate the extent to which interactivity in virtual customer communities influences the relationship between a firm's absorptive capacity (the ability to identify, assimilate, and apply external knowledge) and the extent to which a firm develops incremental and radical innovations. Methodology: We test this model with a quantitative survey-based research design that involves 102 firm-sponsored virtual customer communities. We use hierarchical regression techniques to test our hypotheses. Results: Absorptive capacity is positively related to incremental innovation and negatively related to radical innovation. Furthermore, virtual customer community interactivity moderates the relationship between absorptive capacity and incremental innovation. Conclusions: Virtual customer communities are transforming communication relationships between organizations and customers in ways that influence a firm's learning and innovation activities.

In this paper, we present a preliminary concept and hypothesize that social constructivist learning can be implemented through a semantic network topology of a discussion platform. To that end, we developed Ligilo, a peer-learning, online platform, in which each content item is conveyed as a node in a semantic network constructed of posts. Analysis of this platform consists of three parts. First, we review the theoretical background of networked-structured discussions in learning. Then, we describe the architecture of Ligilo, focusing on two aspects: (1) the learning experience as a process of contributing new information items by relating to existing items and (2) a deep, behavioral analytics framework as a teacher's guide.

We built models to quantify the impact of the overlapping processes on the interaction strength among PD teams, which we then used to construct structural similarity by combining tie strength and social cohesion among teams via the design structure matrix. To evaluate the organization network, we propose social embeddedness-related centrality indices within (intracluster) and across (intercluster) team groupings. To facilitate knowledge sharing, we base team attribute similarity on product- and process-related expertise among teams. We integrate the modularity index and an improved silhouette index to find an optimal number of clusters, which we then incorporate with team similarity measures as inputs to a spectral clustering algorithm. An industrial example illustrates the proposed model. The clustering results reinforce several managerial practices but also yield new insights, such as how to measure similarity among teams based on organizational network characteristics and how structural and attribute similarities impact the optimal organizational structure.","1558-0040","","10.1109/TEM.2019.2939398","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:71872011,71929101); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8874959","Clustering algorithm;design structure matrix (DSM);organization design;product development (PD);project management;social network analysis (SNA)","Organizations;Clustering algorithms;Social network theory;Product development;Complexity theory","","7","","44","CCBY","17 Oct 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This can be valuable for the adoption of this learning approach and team formation by other universities and institutes. Background: Preparing students for the SE industry requires bringing them in close collaboration to real-world tasks. This is usually performed via students carrying out software projects, working in teams. In such environments, the knowledge sharing and the interactions within the team are worth investigating, as they can affect the outcome of the student collaboration and can provide insight on how the collaboration is valued by the team members. Research Questions: 1) What is the effect of TMS on students in SE education? 2) Do parameters, such as gender, affect TMS development? 3) Does the inclusion of a project manager with more expertise affect TMS? Methodology: Students were divided into teams working on SE projects. Teams consist of both undergraduate and postgraduate students.

Current market pressures drive firms to adapt new design process in product development (PD) processes. Nevertheless, choosing the effective PD process is a challenging, complex decision. There is a critical need to develop a performance measurements system (PMS) for choosing appropriate product development (PD) processes in garment design to support product mangers to effectively respond to market. This paper presents a knowledge-based open performance measurement system (KBO-PMS) in big data environment, in order to support complex industrial decision-making for new product development. Its dynamic and flexible structure enables the whole system to be more adapted to knowledge sharing of product managers and processing of various time-varying data. The proposed KBO-PMS is composed of an interactive structure, capable of both integrating new KPIs from the open resource and tracking the evolution of the KBO-PMS components with time. The proposed KBO-PMS has been validated by realizing the performance evaluation of product development (PD) in fashion industry.

Culturally diverse teams separated by physical distances across multiple time zones face significant challenges in collaborating effectively with each other. This article examines a fourth dimension—cognitive distance—that relates to the problem-solving style of teams that can also have an impact on their ability to collaborate successfully. Research questions: 1. Does cognitive distance affect communication among global software development teams collaborating with each other? 2. How does cognitive distance affect the sentiment/emotion of global software development teams collaborating with each other? Literature review: Prior research shows that collaboration among teams on global software development projects is impacted by practices to manage collaboration; appropriate use of collaboration technologies; collaboration readiness that relates to individual characteristics such as personality traits, motivation, and trust; and shared understanding in group problem-solving. While shared understanding has looked at the effectiveness of the use of common language and knowledge sharing, it has not examined how differences in problem-solving styles of geographically dispersed teams impact their ability to collaborate successfully. Methodology: We examined project artifacts and email communication among geographically dispersed teams within a global software development project. From the project artifacts, we examined tasks allocated to different teams. From the emails, we established the communication network and volume of communication, and performed a sentiment analysis on email content. This analysis allowed us to observe not only the quality of communication among the teams but also the sentiment/emotion that reflected how well they were working together. Results and discussion: Managing teams that vastly differ in problem-solving styles and tasks requires that project managers be aware of these differences and introduce liaisons that reach across the teams to help bridge the cognitive divide.","1558-1500","","10.1109/TPC.2020.3029674","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9247281","Cognitive science;collaboration;global communication","Software tools;Collaboration;Problem-solving;Cultural differences;Task analysis;Cognitive science;Global communication","","6","","39","IEEE","3 Nov 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Towards effective multi-task CNN architectures, recent studies automatically learn the optimal combinations of task-specific features at single network layers. However, they generally learn an unchanged operation of feature combination after training, regardless of the characteristic changes of task-specific features across different inputs. In this paper, we propose a novel Adaptive Feature Aggregation (AFA) layer for multi-task CNNs, in which a dynamic aggregation mechanism is designed to allow each task adaptively determines the degree to which the knowledge sharing or preserving between tasks is needed based on the characteristics of inputs. We introduce two types of aggregation modules to the AFA layer, which realize the adaptive feature aggregation by capturing the feature dependencies of different tasks along the channel and spatial axes, respectively. The AFA layer is a plug-and-play component with low parameter and computation overheads, and can be trained end-to-end along with backbone networks. For both pixel-level and image-level tasks, we empirically show that our approach substantially outperforms the previous state-of-the-art methods of multi-task CNNs.

Designing such a schedule represents a difficult task in which aspects as content similarity and the overlapping of similar tracks should be taken into account. In this paper a two-phase solution approach is proposed for helping planners designing schedules. In first place, talks are grouped into tracks upon the basis of talks content. Then, a timetable for the tracks is created by group them over the basis of content similarity, avoiding those with similar content to be scheduled in parallel.

Some types of labeled data in real scenes are scarce and difficult to obtain, such as some aerospace data. It is important to address the problem of nonshared and imbalanced unsupervised domain adaptation (NI-UDA) from the labeled Big Data with nonshared and long-tail distribution to unlabeled specified small and imbalanced space applications, where nonshared classes mean the label space out of the target domain. Previous methods proposed to integrate the semantic knowledge of Big Data to help the unsupervised domain adaptation for sparse data. However, they have the challenges of limited effect of knowledge sharing for long-tail Big Data and the imbalanced domain adaptation. To solve them, our goal is to leverage priori hierarchy knowledge to enhance domain contrastive aligned feature representation with graph reasoning. Our method consists of hierarchy graph reasoning (HGR) layer and K-positive contrastive domain adaptation (K-CDA). Our HGR contributes to learn direct semantic patterns for sparse classes by hierarchy attention in self-attention, nonlinear mapping, and graph normalization. For alleviating imbalanced domain adaptation, we proposed K-CDA, which explores k-positive instances for each class to every mini-batch with contrastive learning to align imbalanced feature representations. Compared with the previous contrastive UDA, our K-CDA alleviates the problems of large memory consumption and high computational cost. Experiments on three benchmark datasets shows our methods consistently improve the state-of-the-art contrastive UDA algorithms.","1557-9603","","10.1109/TAES.2022.3182636","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9795210","","Big Data;Semantics;Cognition;Adaptation models;Task analysis;Reliability;Prototypes","","3","","52","IEEE","13 Jun 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Due to the computational complexity of this problem, evolutionary computation (EC) techniques have been employed to efficiently find composite services with near-optimal functional quality (i.e., quality of semantic matchmaking, QoSM for short) or nonfunctional quality (i.e., QoS) for each composition request individually. With a rapid increase in composition requests from a growing number of users, solving one composition request at a time can hardly meet the efficiency target anymore. Driven by the idea that the solutions obtained from solving one request can be highly useful for tackling other related requests, multitasking service composition approaches have been proposed to efficiently deal with multiple composition requests concurrently. However, existing attempts have not been effective in learning and sharing knowledge among solutions for multiple requests. In this article, we model the problem of collectively handling multiple service composition requests as a new multitasking service composition problem and propose a new permutation-based multifactorial evolutionary algorithm based on an estimation of distribution algorithm (EDA), named PMFEA-EDA, to effectively and efficiently solve this problem. In particular, we introduce a novel method for effective knowledge sharing across different service composition requests. For that, we develop a new sampling mechanism to increase the chance of identifying high-quality service compositions in both the single-tasking and multitasking contexts. Our experiment shows that our proposed approach, PMFEA-EDA, takes much less time than existing approaches that process each service request separately, and also outperforms them in terms of both QoSM and QoS.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2022.3170899","New Zealand Marsden Fund administrated by the Royal Society of New Zealand(grant numbers:VUW1510); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9765521","Combinatorial optimization;estimation of distribution algorithm (EDA);evolutionary multitasking;quality of services (QoS) optimization;Web service composition","Semantic Web;Learning systems;Web services;Heuristic algorithms;Semantics;Estimation;Quality of service","","3","","65","IEEE","29 Apr 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Developer-Artifact interactions indicate developers define or access pieces of information within artifacts. Developer-Developer interactions indicate the exchange of information among developers using a collaboration platform to clarify an issue, promote an idea, or expose any thoughtful comment. PROBLEM: The number of such interactions grows over time and makes it difficult to capture and assess the evolution of the developers' knowledge about specific software project artifacts and tasks. Further, this knowledge decreases over time due to the natural limitations of human cognition that restrict our capabilities to cope with information overload. Besides, who has more knowledge about specific project elements are important to promote collaboration. AIMS: The Ka, Ks, Kc, and Kp models capture the evolution of the developers' knowledge about software project elements such as artifacts, tasks, similar tasks, and the whole software project. These models represent not only the knowledge developers have about these elements but also capture how this knowledge decreases over time based on forgetting and relearning functions. EVALUATION: An experimental study analyzed some developers' interactions on artifacts for the purpose of predicting the evolution of developers' knowledge in six software projects. The results show that the developers' rankings by performed tasks and by our models have 72% or more of similarity. CONCLUSION: Our models can capture and assess the evolution of the developers' knowledge and help to identify which developers have more knowledge about specific elements of software projects.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3042429","Advanced High Performance Computing Center (NACAD/COPPE) at Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ); Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9279201","Knowledge model;interactions in software development;expert recommendation;recommendation system","Task analysis;Software;History;Tools;Software measurement;Load modeling;Collaboration","","3","","51","CCBY","3 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To achieve these goals, we examine real-world examples and case studies to analyze the impact of open-source software on automotive systems. We extracted and collected 4092 open source components from real-world automotive firmware and compared the differences and similarities to 20010 commonly used components in operating systems such as Linux. The results show that the automotive firmware contains 79.8 open source components on average, which account for 15.84% of all binary files in the firmware. Moreover, 61.15% detected libraries are automotive-specific and are different from the commonly used components.

Wikipedia being the world’s largest-ever community-based collaborative encyclopedia, is also one of the biggest UGC databases in the world. Wikipedia is dealing with a significant problem of Information Quality (IQ) because of its open-source and collaborative nature. When carrying out attacks such as link spamming, malicious users take advantage of Wikipedia’s popularity on the World Wide Web (WWW). As a result, Wikipedia is generally not recommended for academic-related work. There are, however, some articles that are both rich in information and quality. Existing approaches for assessing Wikipedia’s IQ involve statistical models and machine learning algorithms; however, the existing models do not produce satisfactory results. In this study, a novel theoretical model based on Google’s E-A-T framework is introduced to assess Wikipedia’s IQ. The model comprises three IQ constructs Expertise, Authority and Trustworthiness. Based on the empirical findings and study results, a set of IQ dimensions that influence the above three IQ constructs, as well as 45 IQ attributes to measure the IQ dimensions, were identified. The IQ attributes were automatically and inexpensively extracted from the content and meta-data statistics of Wikipedia articles using a Selenium 3.14 web automation script. A sample of 2000 articles comprising 1000 Featured Articles (FA) and 1000 non-FA articles from six WikiProjects was used for the data analysis. The proposed model was compared with three previously published models in terms of classification and clustering accuracy. It received classification and clustering accuracies of 95% and 93% respectively, which is a drastic improvement over the existing models. Furthermore, an average inter-rater agreement of 84% was observed. Thus, the proposed model’s effectiveness is fairly validated by this extensive experiment.

Prior approaches explore knowledge sharing between classes to improve performance of unsupervised domain adaption methods. However these methods have inductive bias for prior tree or graph. And previous contrastive domain adaptation methods take center-based prototypes as positive samples which only coarsely characterize the domain structure, and fail to depict the local data structure. To fix these problems, we propose a novel framework called contrastive memory feature transfer (CMFT). To solve nonshared data sharing without inductive bias, we build a centroid memory based directed memory transfer mechanism to enhance imbalanced class features with similar nonshared class centroid. To address the imbalanced domain adaptation, we design a fault-tolerant and fine-grained neighborhood prototype for the contrastive learning which can narrow the domain shift.

Like many digital platforms, expanding consumer market to generate revenue has been a challenge for knowledge payment platforms as well and subsidy strategy is seen as the most important way for the same. In this paper, we focus on the pricing and subsidy strategies of two knowledge payment platforms with providers of different ability to balance the revenue from consumers and subsidies to providers. Specifically, we introduce a duopoly competition model and characterize the technical service fees and subsidies in this model. Further, we respectively analyze the impacts of providers’ ability gap on two competing platforms’ pricing and subsidy strategies, market shares, as well as profits. We find that as providers’ ability gap increases, the platform with high-ability providers adopts strategies of increasing technical service fees and subsidies, while the platform with low-ability providers has to adopt strategies of decreasing technical service fees and subsidies. In addition, compared with low-quality platform, the platform with high-ability providers can occupy a larger share in consumer market. However, influenced by multiple factors, the provider market is relatively complex and the presence of high-quality platform cannot always ensure a larger share of it. Finally, we also find that as the difference in providers’ ability of two competing platforms increases, the profit gap between these platforms also widens.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3298956","Key Programs of China State Railway Group(grant numbers:B23D00081); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:B22A1500010); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10194947","Knowledge payment platforms;pricing strategies;subsidy strategies;providers’ ability gap;duopoly competition","Pricing;Mathematical models;Business;Analytical models;Production;Heuristic algorithms;Knowledge based systems;Electronic commerce","","","","65","CCBY","26 Jul 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A medical image consumes a significant amount of memory, and the size of medical images continues to grow as medical imaging technology progresses. In addition, an image is shared for analysis to support knowledge sharing and disease diagnosis. Therefore, health care systems must ensure that medical images are appropriately distributed without information loss in a timely and secure manner. Image compression is the primary process performed on each medical image before it is shared to ensure that the purpose of sharing an image is accomplished.

The results indicate that much of the contemporary wide-ranging performance contracting study do not have robust theoretical grounds. The review submits managerial implications which potentially assist practitioners, consultants, and academicians understand the concept of performance contracting, quality design, and management. This paper proposes a categorization structure of performance contracting study and proposes directions for future study on performance contracting, which should explicitly connect to contemporary study themes. This paper informs further systematic endeavours to conduct more beneficial literature reviews about performance contracting in diverse organizational setups.","1937-4178","","10.1109/EMR.2019.2924203","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8747406","Performance contracting;Performance appraisal;Performance indicators;Systematic Review;Performance measurement","Organizations;Systematics;Appraisal;Bibliographies;Tools;Contracts;Economics","","","","154","IEEE","27 Jun 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To help manufacturers develop a smart home system, we design a federated learning (FL) system leveraging a reputation mechanism to assist home appliance manufacturers to train a machine learning model based on customers’ data. Then, manufacturers can predict customers’ requirements and consumption behaviors in the future. The working flow of the system includes two stages: in the first stage, customers train the initial model provided by the manufacturer using both the mobile phone and the mobile-edge computing (MEC) server. Customers collect data from various home appliances using phones, and then they download and train the initial model with their local data. After deriving local models, customers sign on their models and send them to the blockchain. In case customers or manufacturers are malicious, we use the blockchain to replace the centralized aggregator in the traditional FL system. Since records on the blockchain are untampered, malicious customers or manufacturers’ activities are traceable. In the second stage, manufacturers select customers or organizations as miners for calculating the averaged model using received models from customers. By the end of the crowdsourcing task, one of the miners, who is selected as the temporary leader, uploads the model to the blockchain. To protect customers’ privacy and improve the test accuracy, we enforce differential privacy (DP) on the extracted features and propose a new normalization technique. We experimentally demonstrate that our normalization technique outperforms batch normalization when features are under DP protection. In addition, to attract more customers to participate in the crowdsourcing FL task, we design an incentive mechanism to award participants.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2020.3017377","Nanyang Technological University Startup Grant; Alibaba-NTU Singapore Joint Research Institute; Singapore Ministry of Education Academic Research Fund(grant numbers:Tier 1 RG128/18,Tier 1 RG115/19,Tier 1 RT07/19,Tier 1 RT01/19,Tier 2 MOE2019-T2-1-176); NTU-WASP Joint Project; Singapore National Research Foundation under its Strategic Capability Research Centres Funding Initiative: Strategic Centre for Research in Privacy-Preserving Technologies and Systems; Energy Research Institute @NTU; Singapore NRF National Satellite of Excellence, Design Science and Technology for Secure Critical Infrastructure NSoE(grant numbers:DeST-SCI2019-0012); AI Singapore 100 Experiments Programme; NTU Project for Large Vertical Take-Off and Landing Research Platform; MOE AcRF Tier 1(grant numbers:2019-T1-001-044); National Research Foundation (NRF), Singapore, under Singapore Energy Market Authority, Energy Resilience(grant numbers:NRF2017EWT-EP003-041); Singapore NRF(grant numbers:2015-NRF-ISF001-2277); Singapore NRF National Satellite of Excellence, Design Science and Technology for Secure Critical Infrastructure NSoE(grant numbers:DeST-SCI2019-0007); A*STAR-NTU-SUTD Joint Research Grant on Artificial Intelligence for the Future of Manufacturing(grant numbers:RGANS1906); Wallenberg AI, Autonomous Systems and Software Program and Nanyang Technological University(grant numbers:M4082187 (4080)); NTU-WeBank JRI(grant numbers:NWJ-2020-004); Alibaba Group through Alibaba Innovative Research Program and Alibaba-NTU Singapore Joint Research Institute, NTU-Singapore, Singapore Ministry of Education Tier 1(grant numbers:RG16/20); RIE 2020 Advanced Manufacturing and Engineering Domain’s Core Funds-SERC Strategic Funds: Trusted Data Vault (Phase 1)(grant numbers:A1918g0063); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:11703010); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9170559","Blockchain;crowdsourcing;differential privacy (DP);federated learning (FL);Internet of Things (IoT);mobile-edge computing (MEC)","Blockchain;Computational modeling;Crowdsourcing;Differential privacy;Home appliances","","338","","66","IEEE","18 Aug 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, the on-demand use of energy is considered a big challenge to achieve the optimal cost for households. This paper proposes a blockchain-based predictive energy trading platform to provide real-time support, day-ahead controlling, and generation scheduling of distributed energy resources. The proposed blockchain-based platform consists of two modules; blockchain-based energy trading and smart contract enabled predictive analytics modules. The blockchain module allows peers with real-time energy consumption monitoring, easy energy trading control, reward model, and unchangeable energy trading transaction logs. The smart contract enabled predictive analytics module aims to build a prediction model based on historical energy consumption data to predict short-term energy consumption. This paper uses real energy consumption data acquired from the Jeju province energy department, the Republic of Korea. This study aims to achieve optimal power flow and energy crowdsourcing, supporting energy trading among the consumer and prosumer. Energy trading is based on day-ahead, real-time control, and scheduling of distributed energy resources to meet the smart grid’s load demand. Moreover, we use data mining techniques to perform time-series analysis to extract and analyze underlying patterns from the historical energy consumption data. The time-series analysis supports energy management to devise better future decisions to plan and manage energy resources effectively. To evaluate the proposed predictive model’s performance, we have used several statistical measures, such as mean square error and root mean square error on various machine learning models, namely recurrent neural networks and alike. Moreover, we also evaluate the blockchain platform’s effectiveness through hyperledger calliper in terms of latency, throughput, and resource utilization. Based on the experimental results, the proposed model is effectively used for energy crowdsourcing between the prosumer and consumer to attain service quality.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3060457","Energy Cloud Research and Development Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) by the Ministry of Science, and ICT (MSIT)(grant numbers:2019M3F2A1073387); Institute for Information and Communications Technology Planning and Evaluation (IITP) Grant by the Korean Government through MSIT (AutoMaTa: Autonomous Management framework based on artificial intelligent Technology for adaptive and disposable IoT)(grant numbers:2018-0-01456); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9358144","Energy trading;energy prediction;predictive analysis;machine learning;blockchain","Blockchain;Smart contracts;Predictive models;Crowdsourcing;Machine learning;Peer-to-peer computing;Energy consumption","","146","","85","CCBY","19 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We approach the study of personality impressions in social media from the novel perspective of crowdsourced impressions, social attention, and audiovisual behavioral analysis on slices of conversational vlogs extracted from YouTube. Conversational vlogs are a unique case study to understand users in social media, as vloggers implicitly or explicitly share information about themselves that words, either written or spoken cannot convey. In addition, research in vlogs may become a fertile ground for the study of video interactions, as conversational video expands to innovative applications. In this work, we first investigate the feasibility of crowdsourcing personality impressions from vlogging as a way to obtain judgements from a variate audience that consumes social media video. Then, we explore how these personality impressions mediate the online video watching experience and relate to measures of attention in YouTube. Finally, we investigate on the use of automatic nonverbal cues as a suitable lens through which impressions are made, and we address the task of automatic prediction of vloggers' personality impressions using nonverbal cues and machine learning techniques. Our study, conducted on a dataset of 442 YouTube vlogs and 2210 annotations collected in Amazon's Mechanical Turk, provides new findings regarding the suitability of collecting personality impressions from crowdsourcing, the types of personality impressions that emerge through vlogging, their association with social attention, and the level of utilization of nonverbal cues in this particular setting. In addition, it constitutes a first attempt to address the task of automatic vlogger personality impression prediction using nonverbal cues, with promising results.","1941-0077","","10.1109/TMM.2012.2225032","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6331531","Crowdsourcing;interpersonal perception;multimodal analysis;nonverbal behavior;personality;video blogs;vlogs;YouTube","Video recording;Media;Blogs;YouTube;Humans;Context","","131","2","60","IEEE","16 Oct 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Therefore, industries outsource their crowdsourced Industrial IoT (IIoT) data in the cloud in order to reduce the cost for sharing data and computation. However, the privacy of such crowdsourced data in this environment has attracted wide attention across the globe. Signcryption is the significant cryptographic primitive that meets both requirement of authenticity and confidentiality of crowdsourced data among users/industries, and thus, it is ideal for ensuring secure authentic data storage and transmission in industrial crowdsourcing environments. In this paper, we introduce a new identity-based signcryption (IBSC) scheme using bilinear pairing for IIoT deployment. Besides, two hard problems are studied, called as, modified bilinear Diffie-Hellman inversion (MBDHI) assumption and modified bilinear strong Diffie-Hellman (MBSDH) assumption. The rigorous security analysis demonstrates that our IBSC scheme for IIoT is provably secure based on the intractability of decisional-MBDHI and MBSDH assumptions under formal security model without considering the concept of the random oracle. The performance comparison with other signcryption schemes shows satisfactory results. Thus, our IBSC scheme is appropriate for IIoT crowdsourcing environments, and also applicable for low-bandwidth communications.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2017.2741580","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8013031","Crowdsourcing;digital signature;Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT);provable security;signcryption","Security;Cloud computing;Servers;Internet of Things;Crowdsourcing;Computational modeling;Computer science","","118","","54","IEEE","18 Aug 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Surveys such as the Sloan Digital Sky Survey have resulted in the availability of very large collections of images, which have permitted population-wide analyses of galaxy morphology. Morphological analysis has traditionally been carried out mostly via visual inspection by trained experts, which is time consuming and does not scale to large (≳104) numbers of images. Although attempts have been made to build automated classification systems, these have not been able to achieve the desired level of accuracy. The Galaxy Zoo project successfully applied a crowdsourcing strategy, inviting online users to classify images by answering a series of questions. Unfortunately, even this approach does not scale well enough to keep up with the increasing availability of galaxy images. We present a deep neural network model for galaxy morphology classification which exploits translational and rotational symmetry. It was developed in the context of the Galaxy Challenge, an international competition to build the best model for morphology classification based on annotated images from the Galaxy Zoo project. For images with high agreement among the Galaxy Zoo participants, our model is able to reproduce their consensus with near-perfect accuracy (>99 per cent) for most questions. Confident model predictions are highly accurate, which makes the model suitable for filtering large collections of images and forwarding challenging images to experts for manual annotation. This approach greatly reduces the experts’ workload without affecting accuracy. The application of these algorithms to larger sets of training data will be critical for analysing results from future surveys such as the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv632","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8209026","methods: data analysis;techniques: image processing;catalogues;galaxies: general","","","80","8","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

This paper proposes a novel framework that introduces noise correction techniques to further improve the quality of integrated labels that are inferred from the multiple noisy labels of objects. In the proposed general framework, information about the qualities of labelers estimated by a front-end ground truth inference algorithm is utilized to supervise subsequent label noise filtering and correction. The framework uses a novel algorithm termed adaptive voting noise correction (AVNC) to precisely identify and correct the potential noisy labels. After filtering out the instances with noisy labels, the remaining cleansed data set is used to create multiple weak classifiers, based on which a powerful ensemble classifier is induced to correct these noises. Experimental results on eight simulated data sets with different kinds of features and two real-world crowdsourcing data sets in different domains consistently show that: 1) the proposed framework can improve label quality regardless of inference algorithms, especially under the circumstance that each instance has a few repeated labels and 2) since the proposed AVNC algorithm considers both the number of and the probability of potential label noises, it outperforms the state-of-the-art noise correction algorithms.","2162-2388","","10.1109/TNNLS.2017.2677468","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61603186,91646116); Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province, China(grant numbers:BK20160843); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(grant numbers:2016M590457); U.S. National Science Foundation(grant numbers:1613950,1115417); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7885126","Crowdsourcing;ground truth inference;label integration;label noise correction;label quality","Inference algorithms;Crowdsourcing;Algorithm design and analysis;Labeling;Prediction algorithms;Predictive models;Noise measurement","","73","","54","IEEE","22 Mar 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Two approaches were recently proposed to address such an issue: crowdsourcing and RSS radiomap prediction, based on either interpolation or propagation channel model fitting from a small set of measurements. RSS prediction promises better positioning accuracy when compared to crowdsourcing, but no systematic analysis of the impact of system parameters on positioning accuracy is available. This paper fills this gap by introducing ViFi, an indoor positioning system that relies on RSS prediction based on Multi-Wall Multi-Floor (MWMF) propagation model to generate a discrete RSS radiomap (virtual fingerprints). Extensive experimental results, obtained in multiple independent testbeds, show that ViFi outperforms virtual fingerprinting systems adopting simpler propagation models in terms of accuracy, and allows a seven-fold reduction in the number of measurements to be collected, while achieving the same accuracy of a traditional fingerprinting system deployed in the same environment. Finally, a set of guidelines for the implementation of ViFi in a generic environment, that saves the effort of collecting additional measurements for system testing and fine tuning, is proposed.","1558-0660","","10.1109/TMC.2019.2908865","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8680659","Indoor positioning;WiFi fingerprinting;indoor propagation modeling;multi-wall multi-floor model;crowdsourcing","Predictive models;Wireless fidelity;Crowdsourcing;Analytical models;Computational modeling;Mobile computing;Interpolation","","67","","51","IEEE","2 Apr 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Therefore, keeping HD maps up to date is important for safe autonomous driving. In general, automotive HD maps are built by the use of expensive mapping systems. In addition, a lot of manual modifications are required in many cases. The conventional HD mapping cannot be frequently carried out due to the high cost. In this letter, we used a large amount of road data collected by crowdsourcing devices. Crowdsourcing devices consist of low-cost sensors. The devices are mounted on repeatedly traveling vehicles such as buses. Although collected data shows high uncertainty and low accuracy, a large amount of data can be obtained in a short time with low expense. We present a solution that keeps HD maps up to date by using crowdsourced data. The developed solution concentrates on landmark information among crowdsourced data and HD maps. By using uncertainty information, we chose reliable observations for map updating. Observation learner algorithms were carefully designed under the consideration of differences between discrete and continuous landmarks. The triggering condition for the map update can be adjusted by the proposed update mode selection strategy. The proposed map updating scheme has been experimentally verified by the use of crowdsourced data collected from real road environments.","2377-3766","","10.1109/LRA.2021.3060406","SK Telecom Company, Ltd.(grant numbers:20005062); Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy; Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs(grant numbers:714002-07); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9357917","Autonomous vehicle navigation;mapping;object detection;segmentation and categorization","Uncertainty;Roads;Crowdsourcing;Covariance matrices;Cameras;Autonomous vehicles;Robot sensing systems","","53","","15","IEEE","18 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Many worker recruitment or task matching mechanisms have been proposed, especially for crowdsourcing platforms, where content information of tasks from the implicit feedback of workers' attendance is extensively exploited to help workers find preferred tasks efficiently. Different from traditional crowdsourcing systems, tasks in mobile crowdsensing systems are usually time-sensitive and location-dependent which also play a crucial role in worker recruitment. However, these context information have not been effectively explored for user recruitment in mobile crowdsensing systems. In this paper, we propose a novel personalized task-oriented worker recruitment mechanism for mobile crowdsensing systems based on a careful characterization of workers' preference. In particular, we fully exploit the content information (e.g., task category, task description) together with the context information (e.g., task time, task location) from the implicit feedback of workers' attendance to accurately model workers' preference on tasks. Moreover, we regard the task-worker fitness prediction as a binary classification problem and utilize the Logit model to integrate the heterogeneous factors into a single framework to predict the matching probability of each task-worker pair. Finally, the workers with the highest matching probability are recruited proactively for each new task.

It is still challenging to construct a large-scale seamless outdoor-indoor positioning system due to the limited coverage of indoor positioning. In this paper, we propose a seamless outdoor-indoor crowdsensing positioning (SoiCP) system in which a radio map is automatically constructed based on crowdsourcing pedestrian dead reckoning (PDR) traces without professional site surveying. The constructed radio map is robust to inaccurate PDR traces and does not rely on prior knowledge of floor plans. In SoiCP, the crowdsensed radio map is obtained by a proposed three-step trace matching algorithm. This algorithm leverages building gates and WiFi fingerprints as landmarks to merge the noisy crowdsourcing traces and accurately construct the user walking paths. Moreover, following the crowdsensed radio map, SoiCP uses an enhanced particle filter to fuse PDR, GPS, and WiFi fingerprinting for seamless outdoor-indoor positioning with high accuracy. The comprehensive real-world experiments in two large-scale shopping malls demonstrate that SoiCP can effectively crowdsense the walking paths and track moving users with high accuracy.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2019.2921561","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61801189); Swiss National Science Foundation via the Intelligent Mobility Services Project(grant numbers:200021_184690); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8733042","Crowdsensing;indoor positioning;particle filter;trace matching","Wireless fidelity;Buildings;Legged locomotion;Global Positioning System;Crowdsourcing;Magnetometers;Interference","","53","","44","IEEE","10 Jun 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, traditional centralized construction of knowledge graph faces many challenges, such as laborious and time-consuming, vulnerable to manipulation or tampering, lacking scrutiny, among others. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel decentralized knowledge graph construction method by means of crowdsourcing, and the business logic of crowdsourcing is implemented by blockchain-powered smart contracts to guarantee the transparency, integrity, and auditability. On this basis, the decentralized knowledge graph is used for a deep recommender system, and case studies validate the effectiveness of the system. This paper is aimed at providing a novel decentralized approach for constructing knowledge graph and serving as reference and guidance for future research and practical applications of knowledge graph.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2942338","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61533019,71702182); National Key R&D Program of China(grant numbers:2018AAA0101400); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8844724","Decentralized knowledge graph;deep recommender system;crowdsourcing;blockchain;smart contracts","Smart contracts;Recommender systems;Blockchain;Crowdsourcing;Google;Knowledge engineering;Industries","","50","","38","CCBY","19 Sep 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
