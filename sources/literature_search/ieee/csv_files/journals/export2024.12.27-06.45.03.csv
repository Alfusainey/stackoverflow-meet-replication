One of the main factors is the availability of this kind of data. Despite the high availability, very little effort has been placed on the zebra crossing classification problem. In this letter, crowdsourcing systems are exploited in order to enable the automatic acquisition and annotation of a large-scale satellite imagery database for crosswalks related tasks. Then, this data set is used to train deep-learning-based models in order to accurately classify satellite images that contain or not contain zebra crossings. A novel data set with more than 240000 images from 3 continents, 9 countries, and more than 20 cities was used in the experiments. The experimental results showed that freely available crowdsourcing data can be used to accurately (97.11%) train robust models to perform crosswalk classification on a global scale.","1558-0571","","10.1109/LGRS.2017.2719863","UFES; CAPES for the scholarships; CNPq(grant numbers:311120/2016-4); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7979607","Crosswalk classification;deep learning;large-scale satellite imagery;zebra crossing classification","Satellites;Google;Urban areas;Training;Data models;Continents;Roads","","44","","12","IEEE","13 Jul 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To our knowledge, MatchNMingle has the largest number of participants, longest recording time and largest set of manual annotations for social actions available in this context in a real-life scenario. It consists of 2 hours of data from wearable acceleration, binary proximity, video, audio, personality surveys, frontal pictures and speed-date responses.

We present an empirical analysis of the performance of crowdsourcing workers against trained annotators in simple and complex annotation tasks, founding that although efficient for simple tasks, using crowdsourcing workers for more complex tasks like social action annotation led to additional overhead and poor inter-annotator agreement compared to trained annotators (differences up to 0.4 in Fleiss’ Kappa coefficients).

These crowdsourcing data are also used to correct trilateration localization results, through which localization performance can be greatly improved. In a room scenario, we locate a human object with a panoramic camera and room map. We first detect the human object on the observed image and search a pixel location that represents the object's location best. Then, the pixel location on the image is mapped to the room map using an artificial neural network. By this method, localization accuracy of sub-meter level can be obtained.

More and more applications are being designed for exploring those idle resources. In this paper, we focus on the idle computational resources, including both human intelligence and machine computing abilities, in mobile social networks (MSNs). Based on the unique features of MSN, we design a new cooperative system, called social-crowdsourcing. The distributed and infrastructure-free features of the system make it more attractive than traditional crowdsourcing platforms. In the proposed system, a huge work is gradually partitioned into smaller pieces, and is propagated from node to node. However, how to partition and allocate these segments is a critical problem, which directly affects the work’s completion time and system throughput. Due to the lack of global information, independent relay nodes are likely to make conflicted decisions, which will cause an unbalanced workload distribution on participating nodes. In this paper, we find that, for a work at different processing stages, one should adopt distinct workload exchanging schemes, moving from a progressive method to a conservative one. Based on this observation, we propose an adaptive workload allocation scheme, in which a participating node can gradually switch his decision strategy according to the workload statuses of neighboring nodes. By using our approach, system throughput can be significantly improved, and large works can finish within a nearly optimal time. Unlike in traditional scheduling problems, we take a human’s rejection, contact delay, and social similarity into consideration. Extensive simulation results show that our proposed algorithms can successfully make full use of the idle resources in MSNs.","1558-2183","","10.1109/TPDS.2014.2330298","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6846357","Mobile social networks;outsourcing;potential resource;social-crowdsourcing;work partition","Silicon;Crowdsourcing;Resource management;Relays;Mobile communication;Estimation","","32","","25","IEEE","30 Jun 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Several crowdsourcing based map generation protocols that rely on users to provide their traces have been proposed. Being creative, however, those methods pose a significant threat to user privacy as the traces can easily imply user behavior patterns. On the flip side, crowdsourcing-based map generation method does need individual locations. To address the issue, we present a systematic participatory-sensing-based high-quality map generation scheme, PMG, that meets the privacy demand of individual users. To be specific, the individual users merely need to upload unorganized sparse location points to reduce the risk of exposing users’ traces and utilize the  Crust, a technique from computational geometry for curve reconstruction, to estimate the unobserved map as well as evaluate the degree of privacy leakage. Experiments show that our solution is able to generate high-quality maps for a real environment that is robust to noisy data.

We first introduce the crowdsourcing margin of majority voting, then we formulate the joint learning as a regularized Bayesian inference (RegBayes) problem, where the posterior regularization is derived by maximizing the margin between the aggregated score of a potential true label and that of any alternative label. Our Bayesian model naturally covers the Dawid-Skene estimator and M$^3$3V as its two special cases. Due to the flexibility of our model, we extend it to handle crowdsourced labels with an ordinal structure with the main ideas about the crowdsourcing margin unchanged.

In this paper, we propose a crowdsourcing-based traffic monitoring scheme that enables a transportation management center (TMC) to achieve traffic flow statistics at road intersections in an efficient, verifiable, and privacy-preserving manner. Specifically, by integrating a homomorphic encryption primitive and a super-increasing sequence, traffic flow can be flexibly structured and encrypted by drivers, i.e., each drivers travel direction at T-junctions or crossroads is protected. As a middle-ware between drivers and TMC, roadside units (RSUs) are introduced to aggregate and further perturb the aggregated encrypted traffic flow based on a differential privacy mechanism. In this way, TMC is capable of acquiring the traffic flow statistics by decrypting the perturbed encrypted traffic flow, without disclosing each individual drivers traffic information. In addition, based on a lightweight commitment proof, the correctness of the encrypted drivers data can be guaranteed, i.e., a selfish driver cannot arbitrarily manipulate his data to poison the aggregated traffic flow. Finally, security analysis demonstrates that the proposed scheme satisfies all desirable security properties, including confidentiality, verifiability, unlinkability, and traceability. Extensive simulations are also conducted to show that the proposed scheme is efficient in terms of low computation and communication costs.","1939-9359","","10.1109/TVT.2020.3005363","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61272512,61402037); Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; China Scholarship Council; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9127838","Efficiency;privacy;traffic management;traffic flow statistics;verifiability","Vehicles;Privacy;Roads;Encryption;Monitoring","","27","","40","IEEE","29 Jun 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To elaborate informative visuals for viewers, existing techniques introduce photo selection as an essential step in crowdsensing. Yet, the aesthetic preference of viewers, at the very heart of their experiences under various crowdsensing contexts (e.g., travel planning), is seldom considered and hardly guaranteed. We propose CrowdPicker, a novel photo selection framework with adaptive aesthetic awareness for crowdsensing. With the observations on aesthetic uncertainty and bias in different crowdsensing contexts, we exploit a joint effort of mobile crowdsourcing and domain adaptation to actively learn contextual knowledge for dynamically tailoring the aesthetic predictor. Concretely, an aesthetic utility measure is invented based on the probabilistic balance formalization to quantify the benefit of photos in improving the adaptation performance. We prove the NP-hardness of sampling the best-utility photos for crowdsourcing annotation and present a (1-1/e) approximate solution. Furthermore, a two-stage distillation-based adaptation architecture is designed based on fusing contextual and common aesthetic preferences. Extensive experiments on three datasets and four raw models demonstrate the performance superiority of CrowdPicker over four photo selection baselines and four typical sampling strategies. Cross-dataset evaluation illustrates the impacts of aesthetic bias on selection.","1558-2191","","10.1109/TKDE.2023.3237969","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62102425,62072465,62172155,U22B2005); Science and Technology Innovation Program of Hunan Province(grant numbers:2021RC2071,2022RC3061); Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province(grant numbers:2022JJ40564,2022JJ30667); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10025559","Computer vision;crowdsourcing;image analysis;mobile computing;transfer learning","Crowdsensing;Adaptation models;Task analysis;Visualization;Annotations;Uncertainty;Feature extraction","","26","","60","IEEE","24 Jan 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Literature has shown that the way these experiments are conducted can influence their results: poor experimental setup can result in poorly reliable outcomes (i.e., highly imprecise aesthetic appeal measures). A question then arises whether the different choices made to collect ground truth of aesthetic appeal data are appropriate. In this paper, we propose a systematic study that looks into how different experimental environments and rating scales used to collect image aesthetic appeal ground truth data influence the reliability and repeatability of aesthetic appeal assessments. Our findings show that discrete and continuous scales with five-point absolute category rating labels yield more reliable results, with the continuous scale being more reliable for abstract images. We also show that image aesthetic appeal assessments could be repeatable across different experimental environments (i.e., lab and crowdsourcing).

We properly profile the tasks’ difficulty levels and workers’ quality in crowdsourcing systems, where the collected labels are aggregated with sequential Bayesian approach. To stimulate workers to undertake crowd labeling tasks, the interaction between workers and the platform is modeled as a reverse auction. We reveal that the platform utility maximization could be intractable, for which an incentive mechanism that determines the winning bid and payments with polynomial-time computation complexity is developed.

However, labels annotated by crowdsourced workers are often noisy, which inevitably degrades the performance of large-scale optimizations including the prevalent stochastic gradient descent (SGD). Specifically, these noisy labels adversely affect updates of the primal variable in conventional SGD. To solve this challenge, we propose a robust SGD mechanism called progressive stochastic learning (POSTAL), which naturally integrates the learning regime of curriculum learning (CL) with the update process of vanilla SGD. Our inspiration comes from the progressive learning process of CL, namely learning from “easy” tasks to “complex” tasks. Through the robust learning process of CL, POSTAL aims to yield robust updates of the primal variable on an ordered label sequence, namely, from “reliable” labels to “noisy” labels. To realize POSTAL mechanism, we design a cluster of “screening losses,” which sorts all labels from the reliable region to the noisy region. To sum up, POSTAL using screening losses ensures robust updates of the primal variable on reliable labels first, then on noisy labels incrementally until convergence. In theory, we derive the convergence rate of POSTAL realized by screening losses. Meanwhile, we provide the robustness analysis of representative screening losses. Experimental results on UCI1 simulated and Amazon Mechanical Turk crowdsourcing data sets show that the POSTAL using screening losses is more effective and robust than several existing baselines.1UCI is the abbreviation of University of California Irvine.","2162-2388","","10.1109/TNNLS.2018.2792062","Australian Research Council(grant numbers:FT130100746,DP140100545,DP180100106,DP180100966,LP150100671); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8281022","Progressive stochastic learning (POSTAL);stochastic gradient descent (SGD);curriculum learning (CL);noisy labels;screening losses;effectiveness;robustness","Noise measurement;Robustness;Task analysis;Crowdsourcing;Convergence;Stochastic processes","","24","","56","IEEE","5 Feb 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To generate the classification maps, usually, labeled RS image pixels should be provided by RS experts to train a classification system. Traditionally, labeled samples are obtained according to ground surveys, image photo interpretation or a combination of the aforementioned strategies. All the strategies should be taken care of by domain experts, in a means which is costly, time consuming, and sometimes of a low quality due to reasons such as photo interpretation based on RS images only. These practices and constraints make it more challenging to classify land-cover RS images using big RS data. In this paper, a new methodology is proposed to classify urban RS images by exploiting the semantics of location-based social media photos (SMPs). To validate the effectiveness of this methodology, an automatic classification system is developed based on RS images as well as SMPs via big data analysis techniques including active learning, crowdsourcing, shallow machine learning, and deep learning. As the labels of RS training data are given by ordinary people with a crowdsourcing technique, the developed system is named Crowd4RS. The quantitative and qualitative experiments confirm the effectiveness of the proposed Crowd4RS system as well as the proposed methodology for automatically generating RS image maps in terms of classification results based on big RS data made up of multispectral RS images in a high spatial resolution and a large amount of photos from social media sites, such as Flickr and Panoramio.","1558-2256","","10.1109/JPROC.2017.2730585","Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:71331005); State Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2016YFE0100300); Research Fund of the University of Iceland; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8002577","Big data;crowdsourcing;deep learning;remote sensing;social media","Social network services;Crowdsourcing;Big data;Spatial resolution;Remote sensing;Satellites;Urban areas;Social network services;Mobile communication;Machine learning","","21","","60","IEEE","4 Aug 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Crowdsourcing has been promoted as an efficient way to reduce the labour-intensive site survey process in conventional fingerprint-based localization systems. Alongside its promising advantages, crowdsourcing produces a number of new challenges, including the heterogeneity of devices resulting in signal diversity and varying sensitivities to different access points. These are caused by different sensor specifications and antenna attenuation. These challenges are exacerbated by differences in the device populations between the survey and client phases. This paper presents a prototype model of a multiple-surveyor-multiple-client system to localize mobile users based on a crowdsourced fingerprint. A linear regression model is applied to calibrate across participating training devices. The conditional likelihood of a client observing an access point not visible in the training phase is obtained using a geometric distribution. The proposed system is able to achieve comparable localization performance. Field test results demonstrate the efficiency and benefit that the previously built radio map can be adapted to localize a new device that has not participated in the training phase with an average matching accuracy of 94% in a real world wireless network.","1558-1748","","10.1109/JSEN.2019.2911707","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8693487","Wireless indoor localization;crowdsourcing fingerprinting;heterogeneous devices;new device adaptation","Training;Crowdsourcing;Sensors;Probabilistic logic;Wireless fidelity;Wireless communication;Databases","","21","","40","IEEE","17 Apr 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It relies on crowdsourcing technology in the collection of received signal strength (RSS) to dynamically update fingerprint database. However, this crowdsourced indoor positioning system is vulnerable to the intrusion of dishonest users (i.e., attackers). Attackers may manipulate the number of users who submit RSS fingerprints, and finally mislead the evaluation of crowd traffic evaluation. In this paper, we propose an abnormal crowd traffic detection (ACTD) scheme to identify attackers according to their abnormal RSS sensing behaviors. Specifically, a fog server is explored to serve as the crowdsourcing platform to perform data storage and detection. We first categorize attackers into three different levels according to their real geographical locations and collusion. Then, through the analysis of pseudonym changing behavior in RSS submission, we propose a rarity-based outlier detection to classify attackers of level-1. Furthermore, we propose a variable-length Markov model, i.e., probabilistic suffix tree (PST), to detect the colluded users who are not at the target point of interest (POI). In addition, a metric learning algorithm is developed to detect the collusion of AP organizer based on RSS fingerprint distance difference. The extensive simulation results show that the ACTD scheme can effectively resist attackers with high accuracy and appropriately deal with traffic evaluation from RSS fingerprint information.","2327-4697","","10.1109/TNSE.2020.3014380","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9159943","Abnormal crowd traffic detection;crowdsourcing technology;fingerprint positioning","Crowdsourcing;Telecommunication traffic;Security;Servers;Sensors;Fingerprint recognition;Adaptation models","","20","","41","IEEE","5 Aug 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The PJND can be used to determine the compression level at which a given proportion of the population does not notice any distortion in the compressed image. To obtain accurate and diverse results, the PJND must be determined for a large number of subjects and images. This is particularly important when experimental PJND data are used to train deep learning models that can predict a probability distribution model of the PJND for a new image. To date, such subjective studies have been carried out in laboratory environments. However, the number of participants and images in all existing PJND studies is very small because of the challenges involved in setting up laboratory experiments. To address this limitation, we develop a framework to conduct PJND assessments via crowdsourcing. We use a new technique based on slider adjustment and a flicker test to determine the PJND. A pilot study demonstrated that our technique could decrease the study duration by 50% and double the perceptual sensitivity compared to the standard binary search approach that successively compares a test image side by side with its reference image. Our framework includes a robust and systematic scheme to ensure the reliability of the crowdsourced results.

How to collect reliable annotations for multilabel data and how to compute the consensus within budget are an interesting and challenging, but rarely studied, problem. In this article, we propose a novel approach to accomplish active multilabel crowd consensus (AMCC). AMCC accounts for the commonality and individuality of workers and assumes that workers can be organized into different groups. Each group includes a set of workers who share a similar annotation behavior and label correlations. To achieve an effective multilabel consensus, AMCC models workers’ annotations via a linear combination of commonality and individuality and reduces the impact of unreliable workers by assigning smaller weights to their groups. To collect reliable annotations with reduced cost, AMCC introduces an active crowdsourcing learning strategy that selects sample–label–worker triplets. In a triplet, the selected sample and label are the most informative for the consensus model, and the selected worker can reliably annotate the sample at a low cost. Our experimental results on multilabel data sets demonstrate the advantages of AMCC over state-of-the-art solutions on computing crowd consensus and on reducing the budget by choosing cost-effective triplets.","2162-2388","","10.1109/TNNLS.2020.2984729","Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61872300,61873214); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:XDJK2019B024,XDJK2020B029); Natural Science Foundation of Chongqing, China(grant numbers:cstc2018jcyjAX0228); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9069472","Active learning (AL);cost;crowdsourcing;multilabel crowd consensus;specialty and commonality","Crowdsourcing;Reliability;Task analysis;Correlation;Computational modeling;Learning systems;Biological system modeling","","17","","60","IEEE","16 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In order to deal with these problems, this paper proposes a novel incentive mechanism based on a new auction model for mobile crowd sensing, which consists of two consecutive stages. In the first stage, a novel Incentive Method based on Reverse Auction for Location-aware sensing (IMRAL) is proposed to maximize user utility. By introducing a task-centric method to determine the winning bids, it can provide higher user utility and higher task coverage ratio. To ensure the truthfulness of IMRAL, we design a unique payment determination algorithm based on critical payment for the incentive platform. In the second stage, we propose a user-interaction incentive model (UIBIM) to cover the situation that a user may drop out of the sensing activity. This new incentive model includes a dynamic double auction framework prompting users' interaction and a user matching algorithm based on a bipartite graph. The proposed new mechanism achieves the goal of improving task completion rates without increasing the cost of the incentive platform. The simulation results show that comparing with other solutions, such as a truthful auction for location-aware collaborative sensing in mobile crowdsourcing and incentive mechanism for crowdsourcing in the single-requester single-bid-model, IMRAL can achieve better performance in terms of average user utility and tasks coverage ratio, and the UIBIM can significantly improve task completion rates.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2902882","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61501075,61701058); China Scholarship Council; Chongqing Municipal Project(grant numbers:cstc 2015jcyiBX0009); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8664672","Mobile crowd sensing;incentive mechanism;task coverage;double auction","Sensors;Task analysis;Games;Heuristic algorithms;Servers;Wireless fidelity;Smart phones","","16","","30","OAPA","11 Mar 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Statistical features of GNSS signals were extracted from widely available GNSS devices and were used for predicting forest attributes, including tree height, diameter at breast height, basal area, stem volume, and above-ground biomass, in boreal forest conditions. The basic evidence of the predictions is the physical correlations between forest variables and the responses of GNSS signals penetrating through the forest. The random forest algorithm was applied to the predictions. GNSS-derived prediction accuracies were comparable with those of the most accurate 2-D remote sensing techniques, and the predictions can be improved further by integration with other publicly available data sources without additional cost. This type of crowdsourcing technique enables the collection of up-to-date forest data at low cost, and it significantly contributes to the development of new reference data collection techniques for forest inventory.

One notable issue of querying uncertain graphs is that the results are sometimes uninformative because of the edge uncertainty. In this paper, we consider probabilistic reachability queries, which are one of the fundamental classes of graph queries. To make the results more informative, we adopt a crowdsourcing-based approach to clean the uncertain edges. However, considering the time and monetary cost of crowdsourcing, it is a problem to efficiently select a limited set of edges for cleaning that maximizes the quality improvement. We prove that the edge selection problem is #P-hard. In light of the hardness of the problem, we propose a series of edge selection algorithms, followed by a number of optimization techniques and pruning heuristics for reducing the computation time.

Therefore, we propose an adaptive approach based on trajectory density. The proposed approach contains two stages. Firstly, the density distribution for each trajectory is adaptively estimated by the Gaussian fitting approach and the density peak points are extracted to construct road centerlines corresponding to each trajectory. Secondly, these extracted road centerlines are incrementally merged by the “matching-refinement-merging” process to generate a road network. We compare the proposed approach against four representative methods through trajectory datasets that are completely different in sampling frequency, trajectory density, road density, and noise. The results show that the proposed approach provides better accuracy in terms of precision and integrity and does not require additional parameter adjustment.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2980174","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9032166","GPS trajectories;map inference;road networks;spatial data","Roads;Trajectory;Kernel;Global Positioning System;Merging;Inference algorithms;Gaussian distribution","","10","","40","CCBY","11 Mar 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, the increasing frequency and severity of natural and man-made disasters constantly strike the cultural heritage sites with significant damages. In this article, we focus on a cultural heritage damage assessment (CHDA) problem where the goal is to accurately locate the damaged area of a cultural heritage site using the imagery data posted on social media during a disaster event by exploring the collective strengths of both AI and human intelligence from crowdsourcing systems. Unlike other infrastructure-based solutions, social media platforms provide a more pervasive and scalable solution to acquire timely cultural heritage damage information during disaster events. Our work is motivated by the limitation of current AI solutions that fail to accurately model the complex cultural heritage damage due to the lack of essential human cultural knowledge to differentiate various damage types and identify the actual causes of the damage. Two critical technical challenges exist in solving our problem: 1) it is challenging to effectively detect the problematic cultural heritage damage estimation of AI in the absence of ground truth labels and 2) it is nontrivial to acquire accurate cultural background knowledge from the potentially unreliable crowd workers to effectively address the failure cases of AI.

Indoor localization mechanisms can help people for navigating in complex environments. Those with complex structures such as airports, shopping malls, hospitals, and others have a massive population (Crowdsourcing) that blocks the visibility (NLOS) between the access points and the users. Accordingly, we present the mobile access point model MAPM as a new algorithm for positioning users indoors based on the mathematical model of received signal strength RSS using UWB-OFDM. MAPM participates in crowdsourcing indoors by using users as mobile access points (MAP). That may decrease the use of several static access points (SAP) indoors and increase the localization precision. First, we use ultra-wideband UWB with orthogonal frequency division multiplexing OFDM as a communication gadget between the users and the system. Those have good quality in terms of accuracy, time response, energy consumption, and efficiency against interference. Second, we measure the received signal strength then, we estimate the distance between users and the access points using the mathematical model of RSS. These can be more adapted to changing environments and device heterogeneity than RSSI fingerprints. Third, we calculate the position information by using the Euclidean distance formula. In this way, we can reduce the effect of most of the problems on the indoor positioning system. We simulate the proposed algorithm in a platform based on three tools, MATLAB for system information processing, MYSQL as a system database, and a control interface coded in Java. In the given simulation results, we find that the average MAPM error in the case of 30 users is 10.19 cm, and the detection rate has a value of 86.66%.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3168677","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9759438","MAPM;RSS;UWB;OFDM;machine learning;DNN;SVM;RMSE;crowdsourcing;NLOS","Location awareness;Mathematical models;Support vector machines;Feature extraction;Databases;Machine learning algorithms;Crowdsourcing","","8","","27","CCBYNCND","18 Apr 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Moreover, existing challenges in transferring laboratory experiments to crowdsourcing platforms put a barrier for collecting large-scale datasets through crowdsourcing. In this work, we address these challenges and propose the RealVision-TMO (RV-TMO), a large-scale tone mapped image quality dataset. RV-TMO contains 250 unique HDR images, their tone mapped versions obtained using four TMOs and pairwise comparison results from seventy unique observers for each pair. To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest dataset available in the literature for quality evaluation of TMOs by the number of tone mapped images and number of annotations. Furthermore, we provide a content selection strategy to identify interesting and challenging HDR images. We also propose a novel methodology for observer screening in pairwise experiments.

For example, in city planning, to install some specific facilities it is required to acquire knowledge about various factors like demand, demographic information, suitability of the resources in that area, etc. However, obtaining this information is a tedious and time-consuming job. Now-a-days, this process can be accelerated by utilizing the enormous power of crowd while outsourcing it to the general people. Basically, seeking opinions from multiple non-experts instead of a single expert can be advantageous in terms of time, cost and accuracy. Although, in most of the crowdsourcing models, the questions posted to crowd consist of a single component. Interestingly, in many real-life applications like city planning, the questions can have multiple components. To exemplify, the posted question can be seeking opinions about 2D coordinates of k best possible locations (i.e., k components) to install k facilities. Moreover, there exist some constraints which are needed to be satisfied by the crowd while providing their opinions. Thus, it introduces a new kind of judgment analysis problem recently termed as `Constrained Judgment Analysis'. Most of the state-of-the-art judgment analysis problems deal with the question without multiple components and constraints as well. In this article, we address this emerging problem and propose a multi-objective differential evolution method to obtain better decision guided by the crowd.

During the past few years, much attention has been paid to learning from such crowdsourcing data, namely Learning from Crowds (LFC). Despite their proper statistical foundations, the existing methods for LFC still suffer from several disadvantages, such as needing prior knowledge to select the expertise model to represent the behavior of annotators, involving non-convex optimization problems, or restricting the classifier type being used. This paper addresses LFC from a quality-sensitive perspective and presents a novel framework named QS-LFC. Through reformulating the original LFC problem as a quality-sensitive learning problem, the above-mentioned disadvantages of existing methods can be avoided. Further, a support vector machine (SVM) implementation of QS-LFC is proposed. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world data sets demonstrate that QS-LFC can achieve better generalization performance and is more robust to the noisy labels, than the existing methods.","1558-2191","","10.1109/TKDE.2017.2738643","Ministry of Science and Technology of China(grant numbers:2017YFC0804002); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61672478,61329302); Science and Technology Innovation Committee Foundation of Shenzhen(grant numbers:ZDSYS201703031748284); Royal Society Newton Advanced Fellowship(grant numbers:NA150123); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8008864","Learning from crowds;crowdsourcing;learning from multiple annotators;quality-sensitive learning","Reliability;Supervised learning;Crowdsourcing;Optimization;Support vector machines;Noise measurement;Learning systems","","6","","30","IEEE","11 Aug 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, due to the complexity of intersections, producing such a map by human resources is time-consuming and error-prone. In this letter, we proposed a framework to automatically produce the topological map of complicated intersections. This framework adopts the crowdsourcing way to collect semantic information about the environment and traffic flows. The topological structure is inferred from traffic flows correctly and automatically.

A fine-grained COVID-19 vulnerability map will be essential to detect the high-risk communities and guild the effective vaccine policy. A mobile-crowdsourcing-based self-reporting approach is a promising solution. However, an accurate mobile-crowdsourcing-based map construction requests participants to report their actual locations, raising serious privacy concerns. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach to effectively construct a reliable community-level COVID-19 vulnerability map based on mobile crowdsourced COVID-19 self-reports without compromising participants’ location privacy. We design a geo-perturbation scheme where participants can locally obfuscate their locations with the geo-indistinguishability guarantee to protect their location privacy against any adversaries’ prior knowledge. To minimize the data utility loss caused by location perturbation, we first design an unbiased vulnerability estimator and formulate the location perturbation probability generation into a convex optimization. Its objective is to minimize the estimation error of the direct vulnerability estimator under the constraints of geo-indistinguishability. Given the perturbed locations, we integrate the perturbation probabilities with the spatial smoothing method to obtain reliable community-level vulnerability estimations that are robust to a small-sampling-size problem incurred by location perturbation. Considering the fast-spreading nature of coronavirus, we integrate the vulnerability estimates into the modified susceptible-infected-removed (SIR) model with vaccination for building a future trend map. It helps to provide a guideline for vaccine allocation when supply is limited. Extensive simulations based on real-world data demonstrate the proposed scheme superiority over the peer designs satisfying geo-indistinguishability in terms of estimation accuracy and reliability.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2022.3158895","U.S. National Science Foundation(grant numbers:CNS-2029569,CNS-2107057); National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2020YFC1511801); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:U2066201); U.S. National Science Foundation(grant numbers:CNS-2029685,CNS-1850523); U.S. National Science Foundation(grant numbers:CNS-2029685,CNS-2106761); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9733817","Differential privacy (DP);location privacy;mobile crowdsourcing;optimization;small area estimation","COVID-19;Vaccines;Privacy;Estimation;Perturbation methods;Crowdsourcing;Reliability","","5","","39","IEEE","14 Mar 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Recently, many studies have tried to detect and reduce the impact of malicious workers. The mechanisms vary from using ground truth to peer review by experts. Although the use of such mechanisms may increase the overall quality of outputs, it also imposes overhead costs in terms of money and/or time, with such costs being often remarkable and contradictory to the philosophy of crowdsourcing.

Uploading raw training data may cause exposure of privacy in crowdsourcing. Federated Learning (FL) is thus introduced into indoor localization since its advantages in privacy protection. Nevertheless, most current FL-based indoor localization studies do not consider deploying systems in real wireless environments. Furthermore, transmission latency and outages caused by unreliable wireless networks are ignored. In addition, centralized FL-based indoor localization is adopted in most studies while decentralized FL-based indoor localization system is seldomly considered. In this paper, a decentralized Federated Learning (DFL)-based indoor localization system over wireless D2D networks is proposed for mitigating effects from single point of failure and communication bottleneck from centralized FL. Moreover, unreliable wireless links are further considered. To reduce the transmission latency, a greedy-based scheduling policy is devised to select DFL participants via jointly considering channel condition and scheduling fairness. For the possible transmission outages, a maximum distribution similarity-based successive model decoding aggregation algorithm is proposed to aggregate models more robustly and the corresponding theoretical analysis is provided. Experimental results based on real-world dataset collected by us show that proposed methods achieve better performance both in reducing latency and localization error than baseline schemes.","1932-4537","","10.1109/TNSM.2022.3232381","Nature Science Foundation of Guangdong Province(grant numbers:2015A030312010); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9999556","Decentralized federated learning;indoor localization;wireless network;scheduling;robust aggregation","Location awareness;Servers;Scheduling;Data models;Fingerprint recognition;Crowdsourcing;Device-to-device communication","","4","","47","IEEE","27 Dec 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

GPS-based navigation systems usually suggest multiple paths for a pair of given source and target. Therefore, users become perplexed when trying to select the best one among them, namely the problem of best path selection. Too many suggested paths may jeopardize the usability of the recommendation data, and decrease user satisfaction. Although the existing studies have already partially relieved this problem through integrating historical traffic logs or updating traffic conditions periodically, their solutions neglect the potential contribution of human experiences. In this paper, we resort to crowdsourcing to ease the pain of best path selection. However, the first step of using the crowd is to ask the right questions. For best path selection problem, the simple questions (e.g., binary voting) on crowdsourcing platforms cannot be directly applied to road networks. Thus, in this paper, we have made the first contribution by designing two right types of questions, namely Routing Query (RQ) to ask the crowd to decide the direction at each road intersection. Second, we propose a series of efficient algorithms to dynamically manage the questions in order to reduce the selection hardness within a limited budget. In particular, we show that there are two factors affecting the informativeness of a question: the randomness (entropy) of the question and the structural position of the road intersection. Furthermore, we extend the framework to enable multiple RQs per round. To ease the pain of the sample sensitiveness, we propose a new approach to reduce the selection hardness by reasoning on a so-called Selective Bayesian network. We compare our approach against several baselines, and the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposal are verified by the results in simulations and experiments on real-world datasets. The experimental results show that, even the Selective Bayesian Network provides only partial information of causality, the performance on the reduction of the selection hardness are dramatically improved, especially when the size of samples are relatively small.","1558-2191","","10.1109/TKDE.2021.3078833","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:NSFC-61806132,61729201); Tencent Rhino-Bird Open Fund, Hong Kong RGC GRF(grant numbers:16202218 CRF,C6030-18G,C1031-18G,C5026-18G); AOE(grant numbers:AoE/E-603/18); Guangdong Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation(grant numbers:2019B151530001); Hong Kong ITC ITF(grant numbers:ITS/044/18FX,ITS/470/18FX); Microsoft Research Asia Collaborative Research; Wechat; Webank Research; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9428574","Crowdsourcing;approximation algorithm;path selection","Task analysis;Routing;Public transportation;Crowdsourcing;Roads;Entropy;Navigation","","2","","47","IEEE","11 May 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This paper aims to demonstrate that the video quality metric performance can be improved by adding a parameter regarding the video content type. In order to perform video quality assessment tests in a short time period, the so-called crowdsourcing methodology is used. In this methodology remote users assess the video quality. The experimental results show that the Video streaming Quality Metric (VsQM) performance is improved when the video content type is considered (eVsQM).

Designed as a practical and deployable system, our solution leverages crowdsourced information to determine the optimum cardinality and provide a routing schedule for the agents to achieve the desired level of accuracy of detection and localization at minimum possible cost. We show that by estimating spatial orientation of the agents with single antenna, the accuracy is improved by 96% over crowdsourcing only. Using geographical maps as the basis, we solve the scheduling problem with a 3-approximation ratio in polynomial time that exhibits statistically similar performance under variety of urban locale across multiple continents.

Deep Learning research typically demands large datasets, leading to reliance on data augmentation and crowdsourcing techniques for data collection. However, the traditional centralization of data in crowdsourcing poses privacy risks, and here is where Federated Learning (FL) comes into play. In light of this, our study introduces FL to bridge this divide in a decentralized way, eliminating the need for servers to acquire labeled data directly from users. This approach aims to minimize localization error in RSS fingerprints, preserve user privacy, and reduce system latency, all key goals for 6G networks. Moreover, we explore the use of power transmission techniques to further decrease the latency in the FL system. Our simulation outcomes confirm the superiority of FL over traditional Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) methods considering critical evaluation metrics like localization error and global loss, paving the way for efficient 6G implementation.","2644-125X","","10.1109/OJCOMS.2023.3301679","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada(grant numbers:DG Grant); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10206039","Federated learning;indoor localization;received signal strength;power transmission;edge devices;privacy","Servers;Location awareness;Data models;Data privacy;6G mobile communication;Trajectory;Training","","","","30","CCBY","3 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, we present a novel orientation estimation and calibration algorithm MSOE, a multiple states orientation estimation based on the smartphones inertial measurement units consisting of tri-axis accelerometer, gyroscope, and MARG sensors. MSOE is divided into two parts, MSOE calibration (MSOE-C) and MSOE remainder (MSOE-R). MSOE-C skillfully borrows the crowdsourcing data expressed in the form of variational quaternions measured by the phones in the same magnet field. As the non-uniform nature exists inevitably when the crowd-phones are far away from the determinand, the crowdsourcing data may be erroneous. MSOE-R provides us a reminder by warning the control center to prevent measuring by the magnetometer and mainly utilize the gyroscope for estimation during the period with unstable environment. MSOE also incorporates a compensation filter for the tri-axis sensors deviation, especially for the gyroscope drifting. Performance has been evaluated empirically in two different Android platforms with four types of phones based on the available measurement system. Performance is also benchmarked against some current estimation algorithms and MSOE provides two times improvement on the accuracy of attitude angle estimation.","1558-1748","","10.1109/JSEN.2016.2597448","General Program of the national natural science fund projects the Key Technology to Precisely Identify Massive Tags RFID System With Less Delay(grant numbers:61572346); Youth Science Foundation Project of National Natural Science Foundation Research on the Theory and Key Technology of General Objects Localization in Internet of Things(grant numbers:61303207); Ministry of Education in 2012 colleges and universities by the specialized research fund for the doctoral program of joint funding subject Research on Cluster Synchronization and Security Algorithm for Wireless Sensor Networks(grant numbers:20121402120020); International Cooperation Project of Shanxi Province The Search and Analysis of Popular Categories Based on Energy(grant numbers:2015081009); Shanxi Province Science and Technology Development Project, Industrial Parts The Production Monitoring System of Coal Mine Based IOT.(grant numbers:20120321024-01); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7529043","Calibration;compensation;crowdsourcing;phone sensors;algorithm","Magnetometers;Estimation;Calibration;Quaternions;Accelerometers;Magnetic sensors","","","","16","IEEE","2 Aug 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Several approaches have been proposed to analyze the relationship between events and media, enable event discovery, and perform event-based media tagging, indexing, and retrieval. Despite the outstanding work done in this area, a major problem that remains open is how to infer the link between visual concepts and events. In particular, the possibility of understanding which perceptual elements allow a human recognizing the event depicted by an image would open new directions in event media discovery. In this paper we introduce the concept of event saliency to define the above event-revealing perceptual elements, and we propose an original method to detect it by exploiting crowd knowledge through gamification. We propose an adversarial game with a hidden purpose, where users are engaged in competitive roles: masking photos to prevent competitors recognizing the related event, and discovering events in photos masked by other players. Rules and incentives are defined to minimize cheating and force players to focus on details that really matter. A suitable algorithm composes the masks created by different players on the same media, thus producing a saliency map that, different from the traditional concept of saliency, does not focus on perceptual prominence but rather on event-related semantics of media. A thorough validation on public datasets is presented, and initial experiments to apply event saliency in detection tasks are proposed . Furthermore, an event-saliency dataset is disclosed to allow further research.","1941-0077","","10.1109/TMM.2015.2441003","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7116570","Event detection;gaming;photo galleries;saliency","Games;Media;Visualization;Event detection;Image recognition;Videos;Context","","21","","56","IEEE","2 Jun 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Recently, sample crowdsourcing and radio surfacing have been proposed for indoor localization for their advantages of not involving burdensome site surveys. As crowdsourced samples are often with inaccurately annotated location labels, the fitted radio propagation surfaces are normally of low quality, which in turn adversely impacts localization accuracies. In this letter, we propose a hierarchical indoor location (HiLoc) scheme to improve localization accuracies of radio surfacing from crowdsourced samples. In HiLoc, we construct subarea radio surfaces to first estimate the initial location of a test sample. We next construct hierarchical tiers of radio surfaces each for one of concentric disks centered at the initial location and obtain a series of estimated hierarchical locations. We then remove possible outliers from the hierarchical locations and propose a weighted location fusion to output the final localization result. Experiments on two field datasets validate great improvements over the peer schemes in terms of much lower localization errors.","2475-1472","","10.1109/LSENS.2020.3002838","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61771209); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9119125","Sensor applications;hierarchical indoor localization (HiLoc);radio surfacing;sample crowdsourcing","Estimation;Radio propagation;Trajectory;Training data;Sensors;Crowdsourcing;Graphical models","","8","","16","IEEE","16 Jun 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

With the evolution of technology, this relationship has evolved into open innovation. As of this moment, the adoption of crowdsourcing platforms has expanded to create an effective channel between the company and its partners. In this way, it is possible to collect and unite ideas from different people who contribute to innovation. Still, collecting a large volume of data without the support of technological tools can directly affect the ability to innovate. Therefore, this work aims to create a method using visual techniques capable of improving the analysis and consequently the management of ideas. For that, usage scenarios were developed from two different bases, one of ideas and the other of scientific articles. For each scenario, groups of similar ideas used different selection criteria, thus allowing the creation of a flow of information using different visual techniques. These techniques can extract relevant non-visual information in a conventional manner. With this information the decision maker gains new resources for managing ideas. Experts in the field of idea management have approved this method. In this research, an application was made available to demonstrate a flow of visual representations in different scenarios. As a form of evaluation, a questionnaire was sent with a series of questions of usability of the method. To validate the reliability of the questionnaire sent to the specialists, Cronbach alpha coefficient formula was applied, resulting in a value of 0.825, a considerable value suitable for the coefficient.

From crowdsourcing ideas and solutions to managing threats from competitors and recruiting technical talent, the utility of social media in the workplace is undeniable. But the path to a successful social media campaign is by no means a clear and sunny trail. Rather, it is riddled with formidable obstacles embedded in a tortuous landscape that can leave the unsuspecting or unprepared technology manager scrambling in retreat.

This characteristic is very convenient when the data structure suffers frequent changes. However, the agility and flexibility achieved is at the cost of losing some important benefits, such as 1) assuring that the data stored and retrieved fits the database schema; 2) some database utilities require to know the schema, and; 3) schema visualization helps developers to write better code. In previous work, we proposed a model-based reverse engineering approach to infer schema models from NoSQL data. Model-driven engineering (MDE) techniques can be used to take advantage of extracted models with different purposes, such as schema visualization or automatic code generation. Here, in this paper, we present an MDE solution to automate the usage of Object-NoSQL mappers when the database already exists. We will focus on mappers that are available for document systems (Object-Document mappers, ODMs), but the proposed approach is mapper-independent. These mappers are emerging to provide similar functionality to Object-Relational mappers: they are in charge of the mapping of objects into NoSQL data (documents in the case of ODMs) for object-oriented applications. We show how schemas and other artifacts (e.g. validators and indexes) for ODMs can be automatically generated from inferred schemas. The solution consists of a two-step model transformation chain, where an intermediate model is generated to ease the code generation. We have applied our approach for two popular ODMs: Mongoose and Morphia and validated it with the StackOverflow dataset.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2915201","Spanish Ministry of Science, Innovation and Universities(grant numbers:TIN2017-86853-P); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8708919","Object-document mappers;NoSQL databases;Mongoose;Morphia;code generation;model-driven engineering;model-based solution;NoSQL data engineering","Object oriented modeling;Data models;Indexes;NoSQL databases;Visual databases;Data visualization","","22","","39","OAPA","7 May 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

First, we show that automatically identifiable patterns exist, in great numbers, with a largescale empirical study of loops over 25MLOC. We find that most loops in this corpus are simple and predictable: 90 percent have fewer than 15LOC and 90 percent have no nesting and very simple control.

Our results show that the pre-trained models consistently outperform the models that were not pre-trained. In cases where the model was pre-trained on natural language “and” source code data, it also outperforms an information retrieval baseline based on Lucene. Also, we demonstrated that the combined use of an information retrieval-based approach followed by a Transformer leads to the best results overall, especially when searching into a large search pool. Transfer learning is particularly effective when much pre-training data is available and fine-tuning data is limited. We demonstrate that natural language processing models based on the Transformer architecture can be directly applied to source code analysis tasks, such as code search. With the development of Transformer models designed more specifically for dealing with source code data, we believe the results of source code analysis tasks can be further improved.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2022.3192755","Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung(grant numbers:SNSF204632); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9835142","Code search;transfer learning;source code modeling;multimodal embeddings;stackoverflow;deep learning","Codes;Bit error rate;Task analysis;Transformers;Micromechanical devices;Transfer learning;Data models","","11","","84","IEEE","21 Jul 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Existing studies on misconfiguration diagnosis treat all configurations independently, ignoring the constraints and correlations among different configurations. In this article, we reveal the phenomenon of multi-misconfigurations and present a tool, MMD, for multi-misconfigurations diagnosis. Specifically, MMD consists of two modules: Correlated Configurations Analysis and Primary Misconfigurations Diagnosis. The former determines the correlation among each pair of configurations by analyzing the control and data flows related to each configuration. The latter is responsible for collecting a list of configurations ranked according to their suspiciousness. Combining the outputs of two modules, MMD is able to assist the user in multi-misconfigurations diagnosis. We evaluate MMD on seven popular Java projects: Randoop, Soot, Synoptic, Hdfs, Hbase, Yarn, and Zookeeper. MMD identifies 510 configuration correlations with a 4.9% false positive rate.

We present an approach to mine video tutorials found on the web and enable developers to query their contents as opposed to just their metadata. The video tutorials are processed and split into coherent fragments, such that only relevant fragments are returned in response to a query. Moreover, fragments are automatically classified according to their purpose, such as introducing theoretical concepts, explaining code implementation steps, or dealing with errors. This allows developers to set filters in their search to target a specific type of video fragment they are interested in.

Machine learning based API extraction has demonstrated superior performance than rule-based methods in informal software texts that lack consistent writing forms and annotations. However, machine learning based methods have a significant overhead in preparing training data and effective features. In this paper, we propose a multi-layer neural network based architecture for API extraction. Our architecture automatically learns character-, word- and sentence-level features from the input texts, thus removing the need for manual feature engineering and the dependence on advanced features (e.g., API gazetteers) beyond the input texts. We also propose to adopt transfer learning to adapt a source-library-trained model to a target-library, thus reducing the overhead of manual training-data labeling when the software text of multiple programming languages and libraries need to be processed. We conduct extensive experiments with six libraries of four programming languages which support diverse functionalities and have different API-naming and API-mention characteristics. Our experiments investigate the performance of our neural architecture for API extraction in informal software texts, the importance of different features, the effectiveness of transfer learning. Our results confirm not only the superior performance of our neural architecture than existing machine learning based methods for API extraction in informal software texts, but also the easy-to-deploy characteristic of our neural architecture.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2019.2946830","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8865646","API extraction;CNN;word embedding;LSTM;transfer learning","Libraries;Feature extraction;Machine learning;Software;Computer architecture;Training data;Manuals","","25","","61","IEEE","14 Oct 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

With the massive amount of available programs such as (on GitHub or Stack Overflow), identifying and localizing the precise code is critical for the software developers. In addition, Deep learning has recently been widely applied to different code-related scenarios, e.g., vulnerability detection, source code summarization. However, automated deep code search is still challenging since it requires a high-level semantic mapping between code and natural language queries. Most existing deep learning-based approaches for code search rely on the sequential text i.e., feeding the program and the query as a flat sequence of tokens to learn the program semantics while the structural information is not fully considered. Furthermore, the widely adopted Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have proved their effectiveness in learning program semantics, however, they also suffer the problem of capturing the global dependencies in the constructed graph, which limits the model learning capacity. To address these challenges, in this paper, we design a novel neural network framework, named GraphSearchNet, to enable an effective and accurate source code search by jointly learning the rich semantics of both source code and natural language queries. Specifically, we propose to construct graphs for the source code and queries with bidirectional GGNN (BiGGNN) to capture the local structural information of the source code and queries. Furthermore, we enhance BiGGNN by utilizing the multi-head attention module to supplement the global dependencies that BiGGNN missed to improve the model learning capacity. The extensive experiments on Java and Python programming language from the public benchmark CodeSearchNet confirm that GraphSearchNet outperforms current state-of-the-art works by a significant margin.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2022.3233901","National Research Foundation Singapore(grant numbers:AISG2-RP-2020-019,NRF2018NCR-NCR005-0001); NRF Investigatorship(grant numbers:NRF-NRFI06-2020-0001); National Satellite of Excellence in Trustworthy Software Systems, National University of Singapore; National Cybersecurity R&D(grant numbers:NRF2018NCR-NSOE003-0001); Ministry of Education - Singapore; Academic Research Tier 3(grant numbers:MOET32020-0004); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61902395); Beijing Nova Program; Alibaba Innovation Research; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10005619","Code search;graph neural networks;multi-head attention","Codes;Semantics;Source coding;Software;Natural languages;Task analysis;Message passing","","19","","82","IEEE","4 Jan 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Witt takes as input a phrase describing a software technology or concept and returns a general category that describes it (e.g., integrated development environment), along with attributes that further qualify it (commercial, php, etc.).

Our approach relies on Stack Overflow and Wikipedia, and involves numerous original domain adaptations and a new solution to the problem of normalizing automatically-detected hypernyms.

"Understanding Sequential User Behavior in Social Computing: To Answer or to Vote?","Y. Gao; Y. Chen; K. J. R.

In many social computing systems, users decide sequentially whether to participate or not and, if participate, whether to create a piece of content directly, i.e., answering, or to rate existing content, i.e., voting. Moreover, there exists an answering-voting externality as a user's utility for answering depends on votes received in the future. We present in this paper a game-theoretic model that formulates the sequential decision making of strategic users under the presence of such an answering-voting externality. We prove theoretically the existence and uniqueness of a pure strategy equilibrium. To further understand the equilibrium participation of users, we show that there exist advantages for users with higher abilities and for answering earlier. Therefore, the equilibrium has a threshold structure and the threshold for answering gradually increases as answers accumulate. We further extend our results to a more general setting where users can choose endogenously their efforts for answering. To show the validness of our model, we analyze user behavior data collected from a popular Q&A site Stack Overflow and show that the main qualitative predictions of our model match up with observations made from the data. Finally, we formulate the system designer's problem and abstract from numerical simulations several design principles that could potentially guide the design of incentive mechanisms for social computing systems in practice.","2327-4697","","10.1109/TNSE.2015.2470542","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7210192","Game theory;Incentives;social networks;Game theory;incentives;social computing;social networks;user generated content (UGC)","Social computing;Computational modeling;Analytical models;Predictive models;Games;Data models;Numerical models","","11","","21","IEEE","19 Aug 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

While this runtime permission model provides users with greater flexibility in controlling an app's access to sensitive data and system features, it brings new challenges to app development. First, as users may grant or revoke permissions at any time while they are using an app, developers need to ensure that the app properly checks and requests required permissions before invoking any permission-protected APIs. Second, Android's permission mechanism keeps evolving and getting customized by device manufacturers. Developers are expected to comprehensively test their apps on different Android versions and device models to make sure permissions are properly requested in all situations. Unfortunately, these requirements are often impractical for developers. In practice, many Android apps suffer from various runtime permission issues (ARP issues). While existing studies have explored ARP issues, the understanding of such issues is still preliminary. To better characterize ARP issues, we performed an empirical study using 135 Stack Overflow posts that discuss ARP issues and 199 real ARP issues archived in popular open-source Android projects on GitHub. Via analyzing the data, we observed 11 types of ARP issues that commonly occur in Android apps. For each type of issues, we systematically studied: (1) how they can be manifested, (2) how pervasive and serious they are in real-world apps, and (3) how they can be fixed. We also analyzed the evolution trend of different types of issues from 2015 to 2020 to understand their impact on the Android ecosystem. Furthermore, we conducted a field survey and in-depth interviews among the practitioners from open-source community and industry, to gain insights from practitioners’ practices and learn their requirements of tools that can help combat ARP issues. Finally, to understand the strengths and weaknesses of the existing tools that can detect ARP issues, we built ARPBench, an open benchmark consisting of 94 real ARP issues, and evaluated the performance of three available tools. The experimental results indicate that the existing tools have very limited supports for detecting our observed issue types and report a large number of false alarms. We further analyzed the tools’ limitations and summarized the challenges of designing an effective ARP issue detection technique. We hope that our findings can shed light on future research and provide useful guidance to practitioners.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2022.3148258","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61932021,62141210,61902056,61802164,61977014); The Hong Kong RGC/GRF(grant numbers:16211919); MSRA(grant numbers:MHP/055/19,PiH/255/21); Guandong Basic and Applied Basic Research Fundation(grant numbers:2021A1515011562); Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory(grant numbers:2020B121201001); Shenyang Young and Middle-aged Talent Support Program(grant numbers:ZX20200272); Open Fund of State Key Laboratory for Novel Software Technology; Nanjing University(grant numbers:KFKT2021B01); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9705152","Runtime permission;Android apps;empirical study","Runtime;Interviews;Open source software;Taxonomy;Task analysis;Systematics;Software development management","","7","","112","IEEE","4 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Taint analysis technology can improve the understanding of the firmware program operating mechanism and improve the effectiveness of security analysis. It is an important method in security analysis. Traditional taint analysis of embedded device firmware requires complex pre-preparation work, setting up a virtual operating environment. Those security analysts have to invest a lot of time and effort in this work, and the results are usually unsatisfactory. In this paper, we propose a dynamic taint analysis method based on entity equipment. The core idea of our approach is to divide the taint analysis into two parts: the simulation analysis on the host and the real execution on the entity equipment. Since one of the features of our method is based on entity equipment, there is no need to build a dedicated virtual environment. Another feature is that the tested firmware program runs on entity equipment and can ensure the accuracy of the analysis by comparing the results of the taint analysis with the device firmware run-time information. We implement a prototype system and verified the effectiveness of the method, which can perform taint analysis on multiple architecture embedded firmware programs and detect vulnerabilities such as stack overflow, heap overflow and so on. Finally, we verify our prototype with a test case to effectively detect vulnerabilities in the firmware program. And we evaluate the performance of the prototype, compared with PANDA, the time overhead of our prototype is reduced by 5.9%.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2961144","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8937477","Embedded firmware;dynamic taint analysis;cross-debugging","Performance evaluation;Prototypes;Tools;Security;Virtual environments;Testing;Hardware","","6","","33","CCBY","20 Dec 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

As application developers usually are not AI experts, they often choose to integrate existing implementations of ML/DL models as libraries for their AI tasks. As an active research area, AI attracts many researchers and produces a lot of papers every year. Many of the papers propose ML/DL models for specific tasks and provide their implementations. However, it is not easy for developers to find ML/DL libraries that are suitable for their tasks. The challenges lie in not only the fast development of AI application domains and techniques, but also the lack of detailed information of the libraries such as environmental dependencies and supporting resources. In this paper, we conduct an empirical study on ML/DL library seeking questions on Stack Overflow to understand the developers’ requirements for ML/DL libraries. Based on the findings of the study, we propose a task-oriented ML/DL library recommendation approach, called MLTaskKG. It constructs a knowledge graph that captures AI tasks, ML/DL models, model implementations, repositories, and their relationships by extracting knowledge from different sources such as ML/DL resource websites, papers, ML/DL frameworks, and repositories. Based on the knowledge graph, MLTaskKG recommends ML/DL libraries for developers by matching their requirements on tasks, model characteristics, and implementation information. Our evaluation shows that 92.8% of the tuples sampled from the resulting knowledge graph are correct, demonstrating the high quality of the knowledge graph. A further experiment shows that MLTaskKG can help developers find suitable ML/DL libraries using 47.6% shorter time and with 68.4% higher satisfaction.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2023.3285280","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61972098); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10149441","Deep learning;knowledge graph;library recommendation;machine learning","Task analysis;Artificial intelligence;Libraries;Predictive models;Knowledge graphs;Codes;Operating systems","","5","","79","IEEE","13 Jun 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Research shows that developers writing DL software have specific development stages (i.e., SE4DL stages) and face new DL-specific problems. Despite substantial research, it is unclear how DL developers’ SE needs for DL vary over stages, application types, or if they change over time. To help focus research and development efforts on DL-development challenges, we analyze 92,830 Stack Overflow (SO) questions and 227,756 READMEs of public repositories related to DL. Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) reveals 27 topics for the SO questions where 19 (70.4%) topics mainly relate to a single SE4DL stage, and eight topics span multiple stages. Most questions concern Data Preparation and Model Setup stages. The relative rates of questions for 11 topics have increased, for eight topics decreased over time. Questions for the former 11 topics had a lower percentage of accepting an answer than the remaining questions. LDA on README files reveals 16 distinct application types for the 227k repositories. We apply the LDA model fitted on READMEs to the 92,830 SO questions and find that 27% of the questions are related to the 16 DL application types. The most asked question topic varies across application types, with half primarily relating to the second and third stages. Specifically, developers ask the most questions about topics primarily relating to Data Preparation (2nd) stage for four mature application types such as ${{\sf Image\ Segmentation}}$ImageSegmentation, and topics primarily relating to Model Setup (3rd) stage for four application types concerning emerging methods such as ${{\sf Transfer\ Learning}}$TransferLearning.

Research Questions: 1) To what extent are developers’ needs, in terms of Wikipedia articles referenced in SO posts, covered by the SEEK knowledge units? 2) How does the popularity of Wikipedia articles relate to their SEEK coverage? 3) What areas of computing knowledge can be better covered by the SEEK knowledge units? 4) Why are Wikipedia articles covered by the SEEK knowledge units cited on SO? Methodology: Wikipedia articles were systematically collected from SO posts. The most cited were manually mapped to the SEEK knowledge units, assessed according to their degree of coverage. Articles insufficiently covered by the SEEK were classified by hand using the 2012 ACM computing classification system (CCS). A sample of posts referencing sufficiently covered articles was manually analyzed. A survey was conducted on software practitioners to validate the study findings. Findings: SEEK appears to cover sufficiently computer science fundamentals, software design, and mathematical concepts, but less so areas, such as the World Wide Web, software engineering (SE) components, and computer graphics.

To facilitate the automatic usage of these descriptions, e.g., recommending design patterns by free-text queries, design patterns and natural languages should be adequately associated. Existing studies usually use texts in design pattern books as the representations of design patterns to calculate similarities with the queries. However, this way is problematic. Lots of information of design patterns may be absent from design pattern books and many words would be out of vocabulary due to the content limitation of these books. To overcome these issues, a more comprehensive method should be constructed to estimate the relatedness between design patterns and natural language words. Motivated by Word2Vec, in this study, we propose DPWord2Vec that embeds design patterns and natural language words into vectors simultaneously. We first build a corpus containing more than 400 thousand documents extracted from design pattern books, Wikipedia, and Stack Overflow. Next, we redefine the concept of context window to associate design patterns with words. Then, the design pattern and word vector representations are learnt by leveraging an advanced word embedding method. The learnt design pattern and word vectors can be universally used in textual description based design pattern tasks. An evaluation shows that DPWord2Vec outperforms the baseline algorithms by 24.2-120.9 percent in measuring the similarities between design patterns and words in terms of Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient. Moreover, we adopt DPWord2Vec on two typical design pattern tasks. In the design pattern tag recommendation task, the DPWord2Vec-based method outperforms two state-of-the-art algorithms by 6.6 and 32.7 percent respectively when considering $Recall@10$Recall@10.

The vast configuration space spans several different configuration artifacts with their own syntax and semantics, encoding hundreds of configuration options and their values. The interplay of these technologies requires some level of coordination, which is realized by matching configurations. That is, configuration options and their according values may depend on other options and values from entirely different technologies and artifacts. This creates non-obvious configuration dependencies that are hard to track. The missing awareness and overview of such configuration dependencies across diverse configuration artifacts, tools, and frameworks can lead to dependency conflicts and severe configuration errors. We propose CfgNet, a framework that models the configuration landscape of a software project as a configuration network in an extensible and artifact-independent way. This way, we enable the early detection of possible dependency violations and proactively prevent misconfigurations during software development and maintenance. In a literature study, we found that the most common form of dependencies is the equality of values of different options. Based on this result, we developed an equality-based linker to determine dependent options across different artifacts. To demonstrate the extensibility of our framework, we also implemented nine plugins for popular technologies, such as Maven and Docker. To evaluate our approach, we injected and violated five real-world configuration dependencies extracted from Stack Overflow, which we support with our technology plugins, in five subject systems. CfgNet found all injected dependency violations and four additional ones already present in these systems. Moreover, we applied CfgNet to the commit history of 50 repositories selected from GitHub and found dependency conflicts in about two thirds of these repositories. We manually inspected 883 conflicts, with about 89 % true positives, demonstrating the need to reliably track cross-technology configuration dependencies and prevent their misconfiguration.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2023.3274349","Federal Ministry of Education and Research of Germany; Sächsische Staatsministerium für Wissenschaft Kultur und Tourismus; Center of Excellence for AI-research; Center for Scalable Data Analytics and Artificial Intelligence Dresden/Leipzig(grant numbers:ScaDS.AI); BMBF project Agile-AI(grant numbers:01IS19059B); Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft(grant numbers:SI 2171/2-2); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10121659","Configuration dependencies;configuration conflicts;services and components","Software;Java;Codes;Pipelines;Software systems;Software development management;Security","","1","","38","IEEE","8 May 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, images captured using typical real-world mobile camera devices are usually afflicted by complex mixtures of multiple distortions, which are not necessarily well-modeled by the synthetic distortions found in existing databases. The originators of existing legacy databases usually conducted human psychometric studies to obtain statistically meaningful sets of human opinion scores on images in a stringently controlled visual environment, resulting in small data collections relative to other kinds of image analysis databases. Toward overcoming these limitations, we designed and created a new database that we call the LIVE In the Wild Image Quality Challenge Database, which contains widely diverse authentic image distortions on a large number of images captured using a representative variety of modern mobile devices.

Obtaining reliable fruit counts is challenging because of variations in appearance due to illumination changes and occlusions from foliage and neighboring fruits. We propose a novel approach that uses deep learning to map from input images to total fruit counts. The pipeline utilizes a custom crowdsourcing platform to quickly label large data sets. A blob detector based on a fully convolutional network extracts candidate regions in the images. A counting algorithm based on a second convolutional network then estimates the number of fruits in each region. Finally, a linear regression model maps that fruit count estimate to a final fruit count.

Automatic demographic estimation, particularly age estimation, remains a challenging problem because persons belonging to the same demographic group can be vastly different in their facial appearances due to intrinsic and extrinsic factors. In this paper, we present a generic framework for automatic demographic (age, gender and race) estimation. Given a face image, we first extract demographic informative features via a boosting algorithm, and then employ a hierarchical approach consisting of between-group classification, and within-group regression. Quality assessment is also developed to identify low-quality face images that are difficult to obtain reliable demographic estimates. Experimental results on a diverse set of face image databases, FG-NET ($1K$  images), FERET ( $3K$  images), MORPH II ($75K$  images), PCSO ( $100K$  images), and a subset of LFW ( $4K$  images), show that the proposed approach has superior performance compared to the state of the art. Finally, we use crowdsourcing to study the human perception ability of estimating demographics from face images. A side-by-side comparison of the demographic estimates from crowdsourced data and the proposed algorithm provides a number of insights into this challenging problem.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2014.2362759","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6920084","Demographic estimation;demographic informative feature;quality assessment;hierarchical approach;crowdsourcing;human vs. machine;Demographic estimation;demographic informative feature;quality assessment;hierarchical approach;crowdsourcing;human vs. machine","Face;Estimation;Feature extraction;Databases;Shape;Active appearance model;Image color analysis","Adolescent;Adult;Algorithms;Biometric Identification;Child;Child, Preschool;Continental Population Groups;Face;Female;Humans;Image Processing, Computer-Assisted;Male;Sex Determination Analysis;Young Adult","241","","72","IEEE","13 Oct 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Although social data have been applied for transportation analysis, there are still many challenges. First, social data evolve with time and contain abundant information, posing a crucial need for data collection and cleaning. Meanwhile, each type of data has specific advantages and limitations for social transportation, and one data type alone is not capable of describing the overall state of a transportation system. Systematic data fusing approaches or frameworks for combining social signal data with different features, structures, resolutions, and precision are needed. Second, data processing and mining techniques, such as natural language processing and analysis of streaming data, require further revolutions in effective utilization of real-time traffic information. Third, social data are connected to cyber and physical spaces. To address practical problems in social transportation, a suite of schemes are demanded for realizing big data in social transportation systems, such as crowdsourcing, visual analysis, and task-based services. In this paper, we overview data sources, analytical approaches, and application systems for social transportation, and we also suggest a few future research directions for this new social transportation field.","1558-0016","","10.1109/TITS.2015.2480157","National 973 Program of China(grant numbers:2015CB352503); Major Program of National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61232012); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61202279); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; NUS-ZJU SeSama center; Major Program of the National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:71232006,61233001,61533019); City University of Hong Kong; CityU Start-up(grant numbers:7200399); Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province, China(grant numbers:2014A030313753); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:71402157); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61473320); Fok Ying Tong Education Foundation(grant numbers:141075); National Science Foundation(grant numbers:CNS-1343189); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7359138","Big data;social transportation;intelligent transportation system;data analytics;crowdsourcing;Big data;social transportation;intelligent transportation system;data analytics;crowdsourcing","Transportation;Real-time systems;Big data;Data mining;Mobile handsets;Visualization","","189","","66","IEEE","17 Dec 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Current no-reference (NR) video quality models are unable to handle this diversity of distortions. This is true in part because available video quality assessment databases contain very limited content, fixed resolutions, were captured using a small number of camera devices by a few videographers and have been subjected to a modest number of distortions. As such, these databases fail to adequately represent real world videos, which contain very different kinds of content obtained under highly diverse imaging conditions and are subject to authentic, complex, and often commingled distortions that are difficult or impossible to simulate. As a result, NR video quality predictors tested on real-world video data often perform poorly. Toward advancing NR video quality prediction, we have constructed a large-scale video quality assessment database containing 585 videos of unique content, captured by a large number of users, with wide ranges of levels of complex, authentic distortions. We collected a large number of subjective video quality scores via crowdsourcing. A total of 4776 unique participants took part in the study, yielding over 205 000 opinion scores, resulting in an average of 240 recorded human opinions per video. We demonstrate the value of the new resource, which we call the live video quality challenge database (LIVE-VQC), by conducting a comparison with leading NR video quality predictors on it. This paper is the largest video quality assessment study ever conducted along several key dimensions: number of unique contents, capture devices, distortion types and combinations of distortions, study participants, and recorded subjective scores.

In this paper, we present a Deep Multi-Task Learning (DMTL) approach to jointly estimate multiple heterogeneous attributes from a single face image. In DMTL, we tackle attribute correlation and heterogeneity with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) consisting of shared feature learning for all the attributes, and category-specific feature learning for heterogeneous attributes. We also introduce an unconstrained face database (LFW+), an extension of public-domain LFW, with heterogeneous demographic attributes (age, gender, and race) obtained via crowdsourcing. Experimental results on benchmarks with multiple face attributes (MORPH II, LFW+, CelebA, LFWA, and FotW) show that the proposed approach has superior performance compared to state of the art.

In this paper, we propose an incentive mechanism based on a quality-driven auction (QDA). The mechanism is specifically for the MCS system, where the worker is paid off based on the quality of sensed data instead of working time, as adopted in the literature. We theoretically prove that the mechanism is truthful, individual rational, platform profitable, and social-welfare optimal. Moreover, we incorporate our incentive mechanism into a Wi-Fi fingerprint-based indoor localization system to incentivize the MCS-based fingerprint collection. We present a probabilistic model to evaluate the reliability of the submitted data, which resolves the issue that the ground truth for the data reliability is unavailable.

To combat this trend, there has been a great deal of research focused on detecting review spammers, most of which design diversified features and thus develop various classifiers. The widespread growth of crowdsourcing platforms has created largescale deceptive review writers who behave more like normal users, that the way they can more easily evade detection by the classifiers that are purely based on fixed characteristics. In this paper, we propose a hybrid semisupervised learning model titled hybrid PU-learning-based spammer detection (hPSD) for spammer detection to leverage both the users' characteristics and the user-product relations. Specifically, the hPSD model can iteratively detect multitype spammers by injecting different positive samples, and allows the construction of classifiers in a semisupervised hybrid learning framework. Comprehensive experiments on movie dataset with shilling injection confirm the superior performance of hPSD over existing baseline methods. The hPSD is then utilized to detect the hidden spammers from real-life Amazon data. A set of spammers and their underlying employers (e.g., book publishers) are successfully discovered and validated. These demonstrate that hPSD meets the real-world application scenarios and can thus effectively detect the potentially deceptive review writers.","2168-2275","","10.1109/TCYB.2018.2877161","National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program)(grant numbers:2016YFB1000901); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:71571093,91646204,71701089,71801123); National Center for International Joint Research on E-Business Information Processing(grant numbers:2013B01035); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:71725002,71531001,U1636210,71471009); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8520779","Positive and unlabeled dataset learning (PU-learning);semisupervised learning;spammer detection;user–product relations","Feature extraction;Semisupervised learning;Data models;Motion pictures;Economics;Unsolicited electronic mail;Buildings","","146","","39","IEEE","2 Nov 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The working principle of fingerprinting technology is to collect the fingerprints from an indoor environment, such as a room or a building, in advance, create a fingerprint map, and use this map to estimate the user's current location. The fingerprinting technology is associated with a high level of accuracy and reliability. However, the fingerprint map must be entirely re-created, not only when the Wi-Fi access points are added, modified, or removed, but also when the interior features, such as walls or even furniture, are changed, owing to the nature of the wireless signals. Many researchers have realized the problems in the fingerprinting technology and are conducting studies to address them. In this paper, we review the indoor positioning technologies that do not require the construction of offline fingerprint maps. We categorize them into simultaneous localization and mapping; inter/extrapolation; and crowdsourcing-based technologies, and describe their algorithms and characteristics, including advantages and disadvantages. We compare them in terms of our own parameters: accuracy, calculation time, versatility, robustness, security, and participation. Finally, we present the future research direction of the indoor positioning techniques.

Collecting emotional databases is expensive and time demanding, which limits the size of existing corpora. Current approaches used to collect spontaneous databases tend to provide unbalanced emotional content, which is dictated by the given recording protocol (e.g., positive for colloquial conversations, negative for discussion or debates). The size and speaker diversity are also limited. This paper proposes a novel approach to effectively build a large, naturalistic emotional database with balanced emotional content, reduced cost and reduced manual labor. It relies on existing spontaneous recordings obtained from audio-sharing websites. The proposed approach combines machine learning algorithms to retrieve recordings conveying balanced emotional content with a cost effective annotation process using crowdsourcing, which make it possible to build a large scale speech emotional database. This approach provides natural emotional renditions from multiple speakers, with different channel conditions and conveying balanced emotional content that are difficult to obtain with alternative data collection protocols.","1949-3045","","10.1109/TAFFC.2017.2736999","National Science Foundation(grant numbers:IIS-1453781); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8003425","Affective corpus;emotion recognition;expressive speech;information retrieval;emotion ranking","Information retrieval;Speech recognition;Digital audio broadcasting;Speech processing;Emotion recognition;Machine learning algorithms","","134","","65","IEEE","7 Aug 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, in practice, clients are reluctant to participate in the learning process without receiving compensation. Therefore, how to effectively motivate the clients to actively and reliably participate in federated learning is paramount. As compared to the current incentive mechanism design in other fields, such as crowdsourcing, cloud computing, smart grid, etc., the incentive mechanism for federated learning is more challenging. First, it is hard to evaluate the training data value of each client. Second, it is difficult to model the learning performance of different federated learning algorithms. In this article, we survey the incentive mechanism design for federated learning.

Standard bridge evaluation methods rely on visual inspections, which are infrequent and subjective, ultimately affecting the structural assessments on which maintenance plans are based. The operational behavior of a bridge must be observed more regularly and over an extended period in order to sufficiently track its condition and avoid unexpected rehabilitation. Mobile sensor networks are conducive to monitoring bridges vibrations routinely, with benefits that have been demonstrated in recent structural health monitoring (SHM) research. Though smartphone accelerometers are imperfect sensors, they can contribute valuable information to SHM, especially when aggregated, e.g., via crowdsourcing. In an application on the Harvard Bridge (Boston, MA), it is shown that acceleration data collected using smartphones in moving vehicles contained consistent and significant indicators of the first three modal frequencies of the bridge. In particular, the results became more precise when informatics from several smartphone datasets were combined. This evidence is the first to support the hypothesis that smartphone data, collected within vehicles passing over a bridge, can be used to detect several modal frequencies of the bridge. The result defines an opportunity for local governments to make partnerships that encourage the collection of low-cost bridge vibration data, which can contribute to more effective management and informed decision-making.","1558-2256","","10.1109/JPROC.2018.2808759","National Science Foundation(grant numbers:CMMI-1351537); Hazard Mitigation and Structural Engineering program; Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, Department of Community and Economic Development, through the Pennsylvania Infrastructure Technology Alliance (PITA); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8326771","Big Data;Bridge Management;Crowdsourcing;Damage Detection;Structural Health Monitoring;System Identification;Vehicular Networks;Wireless Sensor Networks;Intelligent Infrastructure","Bridges;Smart buildings;Vibrations;Smart phones;Urban areas;Inspection;Smart cities;Public infrastructure;Bridges","","96","","108","IEEE","27 Mar 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A critical challenge for data sharing is to incentivize users to participate in collecting and sharing data. The traditional incentive mechanism of crowdsourcing is not practical for IoV because of its trust issues. Although blockchain technology has been introduced to address trust issues and security challenges, ensuring trust in off-chain data for the blockchain-based approaches is still an open issue. In this article, we propose a quality-driven auction-based incentive mechanism based on a consortium blockchain that guarantees trust in both on-chain data and off-chain data. We first introduce a consortium blockchain that is used as an open and distributed hyperledger to address the security issue of on-chain data. Then, we formulate the problem as a reverse auction in which the platform acts as an auctioneer that purchases data from users. By utilizing a data quality-driven auction model, the evaluated data quality via expectation maximization is used to ensure the trust in off-chain data. The quality-driven, auction-based incentive mechanism can obtain the high-quality data and optimal social welfare with low social cost. Otherwise, we design a smart contract to perform the data sharing automatically. Finally, the extensive simulations show that our proposed algorithm achieves maximum social welfare, outperforms other solutions, and scales well when the number of users or tasks increase. Moreover, the performance of the smart contract shows its low computing cost.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2019.2946611","National Key Research and Development Plan(grant numbers:2018YFB1003803); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61802450,61722214); Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province(grant numbers:2018A030313005); Program for Guangdong Introducing Innovative and Entrepreneurial Teams(grant numbers:2017ZT07X355); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8863960","Blockchain;data sharing;incentive mechanism;Internet of Vehicles (IoV)","Blockchain;Data integrity;Servers;Cloud computing;Internet of Things;Task analysis","","90","","40","IEEE","11 Oct 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

IoT facilitates operations through ubiquitous connectivity by providing Internet access to all the devices with computing capabilities. With the evolution of wireless infrastructure, the focus from simple IoT has been shifted to smart, connected and mobile IoT (M-IoT) devices and platforms, which can enable low-complexity, low-cost and efficient computing through sensors, machines, and even crowdsourcing. All these devices can be grouped under a common term of M-IoT. Even though the positive impact on applications has been tremendous, security, privacy and trust are still the major concerns for such networks and insufficient enforcement of these requirements introduces non-negligible threats to M-IoT devices and platforms. Thus, it is important to understand the range of solutions which are available for providing a secure, privacy-compliant, and trustworthy mechanism for M-IoT. There is no direct survey available, which focuses on security, privacy, trust, secure protocols, physical layer security and handover protections in M-IoT. This paper covers such requisites and presents comparisons of state-the-art solutions for IoT which are applicable to security, privacy, and trust in smart and connected M-IoT networks.

Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANETs) based on Dedicated Short Range Communication (DSRC) are used to carry sensing data. However, multi-hop transmissions for gathering data to Road Side Units (RSUs) in VANETs suffer from low data rate and long end-to-end delay, which can hardly meet the QoS requirements of delay-sensitive services. This triggers the consideration of constituting a DSRC and Cellular-Vehicle-to-Everything (C-V2X) hybrid vehicular network. Nevertheless, using cellular links to carry traffic can cause high cellular bandwidth costs. In this paper, we propose a Traffic Differentiated Clustering Routing (TDCR) mechanism in a Software Defined Network (SDN)-enabled hybrid vehicular network. The proposed mechanism includes a centralized one-hop clustering approach and a data delivery optimization method. Particularly, the optimization is to make a tradeoff between cellular bandwidth cost and end-to-end delay, for Cluster Heads (CHs) delivering their aggregated data either by multi-hop Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) transmissions or by cellular networks. Since the problem is proven to be NP-hard, a two-stage heuristic algorithm is designed. We carry out simulations to evaluate the performance of our data collection scheme and the results show that it performs better than traditional mechanisms.","1939-9359","","10.1109/TVT.2020.2990174","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61775033,61771120); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:N171602002); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9076833","Dedicated short range communication;cellular-vehicle-to-everything;software defined vehicular networking;clustering;routing optimization","Computer architecture;Delays;Quality of service;Routing;Data collection;Optimization;Bandwidth","","81","","26","IEEE","23 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It is the foundation of modern transportation control and management applications. However, the existing traffic speed acquisition systems can only provide real-time speed measurements of a small number of roads with stationary speed sensors and crowdsourcing vehicles. How to utilize this information to provide traffic speed maps for transportation networks is becoming a key problem in ITSs. In this paper, we present a novel deep-learning model called graph convolutional generative autoencoder to fully address the real-time traffic speed estimation problem. The proposed model incorporates the recent development in deep-learning techniques to extract the spatial correlation of the transportation network from the input incomplete historical data. To evaluate the proposed speed estimation technique, we conduct comprehensive case studies on a real-world transportation network and vehicular traces. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed technique can notably outperform existing traffic speed estimation and deep-learning techniques. In addition, the impact of dataset properties and control parameters is investigated.","1558-0016","","10.1109/TITS.2019.2910560","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8697151","Traffic estimation;deep learning;generative adversarial network;graph convolutional network;data-driven model","Estimation;Roads;Real-time systems;Global Positioning System;Sensors;Data models","","75","","54","IEEE","23 Apr 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, we present a general probabilistic model to shed light on a fundamental issue: how good the RSS fingerprinting based indoor localization can achieve? Concretely, we present the probability that a user can be localized in a region with certain size. We reveal the interaction among accuracy, reliability, and the number of measurements in the localization process. Moreover, we present the optimal fingerprints reporting strategy that can achieve the best localization accuracy with given reliability and the number of measurements, which provides a design guideline for the RSS fingerprinting based indoor localization system.

However, the metrics used in the sentiment analysis only classify a sentence with positive, neutral or negative intensity, and do not detect sentiment variations in accordance with the user’s profile. In this arena, this paper presents a music recommendation system based on a sentiment intensity metric, named enhanced Sentiment Metric (eSM) that is the association of a lexicon-based sentiment metric with a correction factor based on the user’s profile. This correction factor is discovered by means of subjective tests, conducted in a laboratory environment. Based on the experimental results, the correction factor is formulated and used to adjust the final sentiment intensity. The users' sentiments are extracted from sentences posted on social networks and the music recommendation system is performed through a framework of low complexity for mobile devices, which suggests songs based on the current user’s sentiment intensity. Also, the framework was built considering ergonomic criteria of usability. The performance of the proposed framework is evaluated with remote users using the crowdsourcing method, reaching a rating of 91% of user satisfaction, outperforming a randomly assigned song suggestion that reached 65% of user satisfaction. Furthermore, the paper presents low perceived impacts on the analysis of energy consumption, network and latency in accordance with the processing and memory perception of the recommendation system, showing advantages for the consumer electronic world.","1558-4127","","10.1109/TCE.2015.7298296","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7298296","Recommendation System;Social Network;Mobile Devices;Sentiment Analysis","Measurement;Social network services;Sentiment analysis;Recommender systems;Dictionaries;Databases;Mood","","71","3","39","IEEE","15 Oct 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
