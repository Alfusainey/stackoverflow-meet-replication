"Global Multiclass Classification and Dataset Construction via Heterogeneous Local Experts","S. Ahn; A. Özgür; M.

To reduce costs of hiring human labelers or training automated labeling systems, it is of interest to minimize the number of labelers while ensuring the reliability of the resulting dataset. We model this as the problem of performing K-class classification using the predictions of smaller classifiers, each trained on a subset of [K], and derive bounds on the number of classifiers needed to accurately infer the true class of an unlabeled sample under both adversarial and stochastic assumptions. By exploiting a connection to the classical set cover problem, we produce a near-optimal scheme for designing such configurations of classifiers which recovers the well known one-vs.-one classification approach as a special case. Experiments with the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets demonstrate the favorable accuracy (compared to a centralized classifier) of our aggregation scheme applied to classifiers trained on subsets of the data. These results suggest a new way to automatically label data or adapt an existing set of local classifiers to larger-scale multiclass problems.","2641-8770","","10.1109/JSAIT.2020.3041804","National Science Foundation(grant numbers:IIS-1838179,ECCS-2037304,NeTS-1817205); Facebook Research; Adobe Research; Stanford SystemX Alliance; Google Faculty Research Award; Cisco Systems Stanford Graduate Fellowship; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9279241","Multiclass classification;ensemble learning;dataset construction;crowdsourcing;federated learning;heterogeneous data;set cover problem","Labeling;Predictive models;Crowdsourcing;Collaborative work","","","","51","IEEE","3 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, this computation process usually suffers from serious missing value problem due to the observation uncertainty or limited reports from crowdsourcing systems. Conventional tensor factorization approaches learn the spatio-temporal dependencies in a collaborative filtering way, which ignores the complex road network structure information and temporal heterogeneity. In this study, we propose a multi-view model with multiple aspects of prior knowledge to impute traffic state computed from a real-world trajectory dataset. More specifically, in the spatial view, rather than focusing on a specific type of road segment, we take the heterogeneity of road network into consideration and model the multiple relations of adjacent road segments. Meanwhile, the temporal pattern is also viewed as a heterogeneous graphical structure that discriminates the weekly/hourly adjacency in the temporal view. Finally, we fuse the above spatio-temporal features to provide a robust estimation under different sparse conditions. Intensive experiments on two types of missing scenarios (i.e., random and non-random) demonstrate that the proposed imputation method outperforms all the other state-of-the-art approaches. In addition, our model represents interpretable patterns for spatio-temporal graph analysis.","1558-0016","","10.1109/TITS.2023.3243087","Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research B of Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS)(grant numbers:22H03573); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10046397","Taxi GPS trajectory;missing value imputation;heterogeneous graph;multi-view","Roads;Trajectory;Tensors;Global Positioning System;Task analysis;Computational modeling;Uncertainty","","","","56","IEEE","16 Feb 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

"Interval-Based Least Squares for Uncertainty-Aware Learning in Human-Centric Multimedia Systems","M. Narwaria; A.

However, most existing solutions in the said area, including the popular least squares, rely on penalizing predictions that deviate from the target ground-truth values. In other words, uncertainty in the ground-truth data is simply ignored. As a result, optimization and validation overemphasize a single-target value when, in fact, human subjects themselves did not unanimously agree to it. This leads to an unreasonable scenario where the trained model is not allowed the benefit of the doubt in terms of prediction accuracy. The problem becomes even more significant in the context of more recent human-centric and immersive multimedia systems where user feedback and interaction are influenced by higher degrees of freedom (leading to higher levels of uncertainty in the ground truth). To ameliorate this drawback, we propose an uncertainty aware loss function (referred to as  $\text {MSE}^{*}$ ) that explicitly accounts for data uncertainty and is useful for both optimization (training) and validation. As examples, we demonstrate the utility of the proposed method for blind estimation of perceptual quality of audiovisual signals, panoramic images, and images affected by camera-induced distortions. The experimental results support the theoretical ideas in terms of reducing prediction errors. The proposed method is also relevant in the context of more recent paradigms, such as crowdsourcing, where larger uncertainty in ground truth is expected.","2162-2388","","10.1109/TNNLS.2020.3025834","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9214979","Least squares;machine learning (ML);multimedia signal processing;uncertainty","Uncertainty;Optimization;Learning systems;Multimedia systems;Signal processing;Crowdsourcing;Estimation","Humans;Image Processing, Computer-Assisted;Least-Squares Analysis;Machine Learning;Multimedia;Neural Networks, Computer;Uncertainty","","","26","IEEE","6 Oct 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Crowdsourcing strategy can be applied to analyze bibliographic data. By gathering journal papers and conference papers from different sources in a specific field and identifying its core authors as well as the evolution of the hot research topics the core authors chose to work on, we hope to provide a reference for future research topics and research directions. In this paper, we modified an existing core author evaluation system by adding an indicator called the weighted score of every authorship. After gathering the experimental data from International Education of Chinese, we used the Price formula to detect the core author candidates and build a core author evaluation system based on five indicators, which were the publication volumes, the number of citations, h-index, research field normalized citation impact, and weighted score of every authorship. The weight of each indicator and the score of each candidate were calculated based on the comprehensive index and entropy-based method. Thereafter, the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model was used to summarize the papers on the hot research topics the core authors worked on for each period, followed by evolution analysis. Using the above methods, experiments were carried out on the bibliographic data of journal papers and conference papers in the discipline of International Education of Chinese between 2001 and 2020 that were included in the CNKI. Scholars whose scores were greater than 50 were identified as the core author(s) of each period. The core authors and the evolution of their hot research topics were conducted in four periods, namely 2001–2005, 2006–2010, 2011–2015, and 2016–2020. It is our conclusion that the compilation of textbooks has always been the focus of the discipline of International Education of Chinese, while the teaching modes have become increasingly diversified, and also research on the training of undergraduates and postgraduates has increased. With the advancement of technology, much relevant knowledge from many other disciplines has been integrated into the International Education of Chinese, and scholars should pay attention to interdisciplinary research.","2398-7294","","10.26599/IJCS.2022.9100036","Beijing Language and Culture University(grant numbers:21YJ040007); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10159561","International Education of Chinese;core authors;Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model;evolution analysis","Training;Crowdsourcing;Analytical models;Pandemics;Distance learning;Education;Employment","","","","20","","22 Jun 2023","","","TUP","TUP Journals"

This concept has been intensely studied to efficiently and securely complete sensing tasks at lower cost. The development of a unified platform designed to provide various types of sensing applications is among the major approaches to economical crowdsourcing. However, existing previous frameworks were not optimized for shared use among multiple organizers because they were largely vertically integrated systems. Security and user trust and confidence is also a significant issue a crowdsensing frameworks, given the potential security concerns. Therefore, in this study, we propose a network-side task allocation (NeSTA) framework to address the existing problems in mobile crowdsensing. The proposed framework enables the horizontal integration of sensing applications, in which mobile networks mediate communication among organizers and participants, significantly reducing the installation cost of individual applications. Privacy preservation is achieved by task distribution and allocation procedures, where the participants were obscured by organizers. The validity of the proposed NeSTA was confirmed by simulations with an analytical model using an open dataset. The results show that the proposed method exhibited computational efficiency over two orders of magnitude greater than the conventional approach. This advantage originates from the reduction of problem size by dividing the original problem into subproblems.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3112272","JSPS KAKENHI Grant Number JP21K17729 and JST, ACT-I(grant numbers:JPMJPR18UL, Japan); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9536689","Crowdsourcing;mobile applications;mobile communication;mobile computing","Sensors;Task analysis;Crowdsensing;Resource management;Costs;Privacy;Data privacy","","","","39","CCBY","13 Sep 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To protect articles against vandalism or damage, the stream of reviews can be mined to classify reviews and profile editors in real-time. The goal of this work is to anticipate and explain which reviews to revert. This way, editors are informed why their edits will be reverted. The proposed method employs stream-based processing, updating the profiling and classification models on each incoming event. The profiling uses side and content-based features employing Natural Language Processing, and editor profiles are incrementally updated based on their reviews. Since the proposed method relies on self-explainable classification algorithms, it is possible to understand why a review has been classified as a revert or a non-revert. In addition, this work contributes an algorithm for generating synthetic data for class balancing, making the final classification fairer. The proposed online method was tested with a real data set from Wikivoyage, which was balanced through the aforementioned synthetic data generation.

However, this projection introduces geometrical distortions on the rendered image, such as object shape stretching, or shearing, and bending of straight lines, which may affect the user’s quality of experience (QoE). This paper proposes an object-based quality metric to assess the subjective impact of the objects shape deformation. The metric uses semantic segmentation to identify the relevant objects in the viewport, where the stretching distortion has a higher perceptual impact, and computes the stretching distortion for each object. Two distinct approaches were exploited and evaluated: the first one, directly computes and compares object shape measures on the sphere and on the viewport; the second one is based on Tissot indicatrices, which are computed for individual objects in the viewport. The experimental results show that while the Tissot based method performs slightly better than the direct shape measurement, both approaches outperform benchmark solutions; furthermore, they are able to classify the viewport quality, with respect to quality scores obtained in a subjective crowdsourcing study, with a correct decision percentage close to 90%. Additionally, the Tissot based approach was used in a global quality metric that finds out the Pannini projection parameters that result in the least perceivable geometric distortion. It is shown that the automatically tuned Pannini projection results in viewports with a more pleasant visual quality than the considered benchmark projections.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3147699","Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia (FCT)/Ministério da Ciência, Tecnologia e Ensino Superior (MCTES) through the National funds and when applicable co-funded European Union (EU) funds(grant numbers:UIDB/50008/2020); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9696333","Omnidirectional images;viewport rendering;geometric distortions;objective quality assessment;Pannini projection;content-aware projection","Distortion;Distortion measurement;Measurement;Bending;Visualization;Rendering (computer graphics);Shape","","","","37","CCBY","28 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Further, certain applications, e.g., distributed crowdsourcing schemes utilizing linear codes, require most or even all the columns of the generator matrix to have some degree of sparsity. In this paper, we leverage polar codes and the well-established channel polarization to design capacity-achieving codes with a certain constraint on the weights of all the columns in the generator matrix (GM) while having a low-complexity decoding algorithm. We first show that given a binary-input memoryless symmetric (BMS) channel  $W$  and a constant  $s \in (0, 1]$ , there exists a polarization kernel such that the corresponding polar code is capacity-achieving with the rate of polarization  $s/2$ , and the GM column weights being bounded from above by  $N^{s}$ . To improve the sparsity versus error rate trade-off, we devise a column-splitting algorithm and two coding schemes for BEC and then for general BMS channels. The polar-based codes generated by the two schemes inherit several fundamental properties of polar codes with the original  $2 \times 2$  kernel including the decay in error probability, decoding complexity, and the capacity-achieving property. Furthermore, they demonstrate the additional property that their GM column weights are bounded from above sublinearly in  $N$ , while the original polar codes have some column weights that are linear in  $N$ . In particular, for any BEC and  $\beta < 0.5$ , the existence of a sequence of capacity-achieving polar-based codes where all the GM column weights are bounded from above by  $N^{\lambda} $  with  $\lambda \approx 0.585$ , and with the error probability bounded by  ${\mathcal {O}}(2^{-N^{\beta }})$  under a decoder with complexity  ${\mathcal {O}}(N\log N)$ , is shown. The existence of similar capacity-achieving polar-based codes with the same decoding complexity is shown for any BMS channel and  $\beta < 0.5$  with  $\lambda \approx 0.631$ .","1558-0857","","10.1109/TCOMM.2023.3282603","National Science Foundation(grant numbers:CCF–1763348,CCF–1909771,CCF–2007878,CCF–2132815); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10144071","Linear codes;polar codes;channel coding;Hamming weight;sparse matrices;error probability","Codes;Polar codes;Generators;Encoding;Complexity theory;Error correction codes;Sparse matrices","","","","32","IEEE","5 Jun 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

One of the fundamental concepts of OER is “the ability to freely adapt and reuse existing pieces of knowledge.” Reuse of educational resources by both individuals and organizations may have significant creative and economic benefit for the educational environment. This Special Issue editorial introduces six interesting experiences, representative of the use of OER in engineering education in important areas such as the production of open content at various scales, reuse of contents, institutional open Web site initiatives, and technological applications to support the exploitation of OER, all at different degrees of maturity. Since some readers will be unfamiliar with prior work on OER, this Special Issue also outlines the hot topics in OER and the critical factors for success when joining the Open Educational Movement. Finally, the editorial provides a set of recommendations and examples offered by the Special Issue editors from their over 6 years of experience leading a research group in semantic Web technologies applied to Open Education. A key requirement, in their opinion, is to improve the metadata interoperability between various collections of open material, so as to facilitate the discoverability and subsequent combining, remixing, or adapting OER; that is, OER data should be easily accessible to any user.","1557-9638","","10.1109/TE.2014.2359257","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6937240","Linked data;Open Educational Resources;open learning;reusability;semantic Web","Special issues and sections;Knowledge engineering;Engineering education;Economics;Open systems;Web and internet services","","41","","24","IEEE","28 Oct 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It is envisioned that billions of physical things or objects will be outfitted with different kinds of sensors and actuators and connected to the Internet via heterogeneous access networks enabled by technologies such as embedded sensing and actuating, radio frequency identification (RFID), wireless sensor networks, real-time and semantic web services, etc. IoT is actually cyber-physical systems or a network of networks. With the huge number of things/objects and sensors/actuators connected to the Internet, a massive and in some cases real-time data flow will be automatically produced by connected things and sensors. It is important to collect correct raw data in an efficient way; but more important is to analyze and mine the raw data to abstract more valuable information such as correlations among things and services to provide web of things or Internet of services. This special issue features recent and emerging advances IoT architecture, protocols, services and applications. More than one hundred papers were received and peer-reviewed, out of which thirty five papers were selected for publication, which cover topics including sensors and devices for IoT, efficient communications and networking for IoT, security and privacy in IoT, crowdsensing and crowdsourcing, localization and tracking, services and applications, and IoT data modeling and management.

Healthcare in the developing world is fraught with numerous problems such as the lack of health infrastructure, and human resources, which results in very limited health coverage. The field of health informatics has made great strides in recent years towards improving public health systems in the developing world by augmenting them with state-of-the-art information and communication technologies (ICT). Through real-world deployment of these technologies, there is real hope that the health industry in the developing world will progress from its current, largely dysfunctional state to one that is more effective, personalized, and cost effective. Health informatics can usher a new era of personalized health analytics, with the potential to transform healthcare in the developing world. In conjunction with mHealth and eHealth, many other important health informatics trends—such as artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), big data, crowdsourcing, cloud computing—are also emerging. Exponentially growing heterogeneous data, with the help of big data analytics, has the potential to provide descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive health insights as well as enable new applications such as telemedicine and remote diagnostics and surgery. Such systems could enhance the overall process of monitoring, diagnosis, and prognosis of diseases.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2783118","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8262687","","","","7","","","OAPA","17 Jan 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Applications that rely on information freshness include networked monitoring, situational awareness and automated control (e.g., tactical networks, sensor networks, airplane/vehicular control, and Cyber-Physical Systems) applications. Other commercial applications include data analytics (e.g., crowdsourcing, financial trading, social networks, and Internet of Things) applications. Age of Information (AoI) is a concept that has recently gained prominence as a performance metric for characterizing information freshness at the receiver. It is interesting to note that improving first-order metrics such as, providing high throughput and / or low delay, that lead to improved performance in traditional data networks, are inadequate when it comes to improving information freshness. Therefore, there is a critical need to re-examine existing metrics and develop new ones for current and future real-time applications.","1976-5541","","10.1109/JCN.2019.100012","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8764478","","Information age;Spread spectrum communication;Monitoring;Measurement;Receivers;Batteries;Smart devices","","3","","","","16 Jul 2019","","","KICS","KICS Journals"

We live in a world in which natural and man-made disasters (such as earthquakes, hurricanes, terrorist attacks, and industrial accidents) often occur. These disasters are so sudden in nature, so causing loss of human lives and interruption of essential public services (such as health care, electricity, water, transportation and communication). Disaster management aims to reduce or avoid potential losses from hazards, ensure prompt and appropriate assistance to victims and achieve a rapid and effective recovery. In recent years, new computing/communication technologies have emerged to improve the efficiency of disaster management; for example, crowdsourcing has been applied in the Nepal earthquake to collect the latest information from earthquake-affected areas and create a dynamic map that shows the locations in which aid and relief are needed. Although some preliminary attempts have been made to apply emerging technologies for disaster management, there are many open challenges that need to be addressed to fully exploit the potentials of these promising technologies.","2168-6750","","10.1109/TETC.2020.2973785","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9024200","","Special issues and sections;Disaster management;Wireless sensor networks;Earthquakes;Energy efficiency;Artificial neural networks;Monitoring;Information and communication technology","","1","","0","IEEE","4 Mar 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
