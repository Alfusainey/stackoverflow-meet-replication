Hurdles for Developers in Cryptography
https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSME52107.2021.00076
Prior research has shown that cryptography is hard to use for developers. We aim to understand what cryptography issues developers face in practice. We clustered 91 954 cryptography-related questions on the Stack Overflow website, and manually analyzed a significant sample (i.e., 383) of the questions to comprehend the crypto challenges developers commonly face in this domain. We found that either developers have a distinct lack of knowledge in understanding the fundamental concepts, e.g., OpenSSL, public-key cryptography or password hashing, or the usability of crypto libraries undermined developer performance to correctly realize a crypto scenario. This is alarming and indicates the need for dedicated research to improve the design of crypto APIs.
